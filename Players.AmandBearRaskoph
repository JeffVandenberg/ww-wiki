His long blond hair is straight and often kept unbound. Being of German decent his skin is pale no matter how much he tries to tan. A basic man, when it comes to fashion, Amand is fond of jeans, sneakers, button up flannels, windbreakers and parkas—when it gets cold.%0a!!!!! %25center%25%25werewolf%25 URHAN APPEARANCE: %0aMuch like in his Hishu form, Bear is a huge muscular figure with blond fur with rust colored patches, but he wouldn’t be considered abnormally large in Urhan.%0a! %25center%25%25werewolf%25 STORY HOOKS:%0a!!!!!%25werewolf%25 FORMER GLORY (Everyone):%0aAmand was once an WBC boxer. Got as far as a number one contender shot, but got knocked out in the first round by Whirlwind Nigel Wellerman. Who went on to become a number one contender to the WBC championship ranks.He hasn’t boxed since and fell completely off the radar of boxing. Maybe you recognize him?%0a!!!!! %25werewolf%25 CREATURE OF BURNING PASSION (Everyone): %0aBear has a lust for life, that few humans—if any—can understand. He hunts to survive, feels the rush of blood in his veins and from the inflicted wounds of his prey. Death is just part of life to Bear. The fury that he feels brings him a sick sense of joy. Human morality seems less and less important to him, as lot as he keeps his Honor. Sure mortals have authority, but he only gives it face value, because he doesn’t feel bound to human authority anymore than he does to their level of morality. Humans are different. They aren’t monsters who hunt other monster. (If you are a player that enjoys playing emotionally charged scenes then you might enjoy have a scene or two with Bear. He struggles with his duality of being an Uratha. Maybe we can have some fun with that)?%0a!!!!! %25werewolf%25 CRAVING HUMANITY (Everyone):%0aBear may not be human anymore, but he does crave to socialize with humans, because he feels a kinship with them remembered from when he was a human himself. Surrounding himself with the herd makes him feel grounded and less like the selfish spirits that he combats. This feeling helps him maintain balance that he needs desperately. Maybe you can help Bear keep his balance, before it is too late?%0a!!!!! %25werewolf%25 THE MOST HOLY PURPOSE (Everyone):%0a''Siskur-Dah'' is held with the highest of revere. Bear isn’t the smarts, or the strongest, or the most charming, but he lives for the hunt. It is what makes him special. He’s part of the fight. He is someone that matters in that way. He’s one of the People. Bear is always up for a good hunt, especially if the prey will bring him honor and is worthy of his notice. If you a monster problem, Bear just might be able to help you out. (Give me a PM with the details before hand, so I can tell you if Bear and the Keepers have the strength to face that challenge).%0a! %25center%25%25werewolf%25[[THE KODIAK BAR]]%0a(:table:)%0a(:cellnr align=center:) %25werwolf%25''(Click to go to the Kodiak Bar Wiki).''%0a(:cellnr align=left:) %25werewolf%25The Kodiak Bar is a popular spot in the South West of Portland.

His long blond hair is straight and often kept unbound. Being of German decent his skin is pale no matter how much he tries to tan. A basic man, when it comes to fashion, Amand is fond of jeans, sneakers, button up flannels, windbreakers and parkas—when it gets cold.%0a%3c !!!!! %25werewolf%25 URHAN APPEARANCE: %0a%3c Much like in his Hishu form, Bear is a huge muscular figure with blond fur with rust colored patches, but he wouldn’t be considered abnormally large in Urhan.%0a%3c ! %25werewolf%25 STORY HOOKS:%0a%3c !!!!!%25werewolf%25 FORMER GLORY (Everyone):%0a%3c Amand was once an WBC boxer. Got as far as a number one contender shot, but got knocked out in the first round by Whirlwind Nigel Wellerman. Who went on to become a number one contender to the WBC championship ranks.He hasn’t boxed since and fell completely off the radar of boxing. Maybe you recognize him?%0a%3c !!!!! %25werewolf%25 CREATURE OF BURNING PASSION (Everyone): %0a%3c Bear has a lust for life, that few humans—if any—can understand. He hunts to survive, feels the rush of blood in his veins and from the inflicted wounds of his prey. Death is just part of life to Bear. The fury that he feels brings him a sick sense of joy. Human morality seems less and less important to him, as lot as he keeps his Honor. Sure mortals have authority, but he only gives it face value, because he doesn’t feel bound to human authority anymore than he does to their level of morality. Humans are different. They aren’t monsters who hunt other monster. (If you are a player that enjoys playing emotionally charged scenes then you might enjoy have a scene or two with Bear. He struggles with his duality of being an Uratha. Maybe we can have some fun with that)?%0a%3c !!!!! %25werewolf%25 CRAVING HUMANITY (Everyone):%0a%3c Bear may not be human anymore, but he does crave to socialize with humans, because he feels a kinship with them remembered from when he was a human himself. Surrounding himself with the herd makes him feel grounded and less like the selfish spirits that he combats. This feeling helps him maintain balance that he needs desperately. Maybe you can help Bear keep his balance, before it is too late?%0a%3c !!!!! %25werewolf%25 THE MOST HOLY PURPOSE (Everyone):%0a%3c ''Siskur-Dah'' is held with the highest of revere. Bear isn’t the smarts, or the strongest, or the most charming, but he lives for the hunt. It is what makes him special. He’s part of the fight. He is someone that matters in that way. He’s one of the People. Bear is always up for a good hunt, especially if the prey will bring him honor and is worthy of his notice. If you a monster problem, Bear just might be able to help you out. (Give me a PM with the details before hand, so I can tell you if Bear and the Keepers have the strength to face that challenge).%0a%3c (:table:)%0a%3c (:cellnr  align=center:) %25werewolf%25[[THE KODIAK BAR]]%0a%3c (:cellnr align=center:) %25werwolf%25''(Click to go to the Kodiak Bar Wiki).''%0a%3c (:tableend:)%0a%3c ! %25werewolf%25IMPORTANT PEOPLE%0a%3c (:table:)%0a%3c (:cellnr width=50%25 align=left style='padding-right: 10px;':)%0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=4px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=7px width=100%25 https://%0a%3c %25werewolf%25 '''[[HaroldKelly|%25werewolf%25Drinking Buddy]]''' \\%0a%3c %0a%3c Harold is a good guy.
