The Tequesta (also Tekesta, Tegesta, Chequesta, Vizcaynos) Native American tribe, at the time of first European contact, occupied an area along the southeastern Atlantic coast of Florida. They had infrequent contact with Europeans and had largely migrated by the middle of the 18th century. Miami is named after the Mayaimi, a Native American tribe that lived around Lake Okeechobee until the 17th or 18th century.%0a%0aIn 1566, Pedro Menéndez de Avilés was sent by the Spanish monarchy to remove the French from Florida who had already established several colonies. Although Menéndez left behind two Jesuit missionaries in an attempt to convert the Tequesta to Roman Catholicism, the tribe were indifferent to their teachings. The Jesuits returned to St. Augustine after a year. Fort Dallas was built in 1836 and functioned as a military base during the Second Seminole War.%0a%0aThe Miami area was better known as "Biscayne Bay Country" in the early years of its growth. The few published accounts from that period describe the area as a wilderness that held much promise. The area was also characterized as "one of the finest building sites in Florida". After the Great Freeze of 1894, the crops of the Miami area were the only ones in Florida that survived. Julia Tuttle, a local landowner, convinced Henry Flagler, a railroad tycoon, to expand his Florida East Coast Railway to Miami. On July 28, 1896, Miami was officially incorporated as a city with a population of just over 300.%0a%0aMiami prospered during the 1920s, but weakened when the real-estate bubble burst in 1925, which was shortly followed by the 1926 Miami Hurricane and the Great Depression in the 1930s. When World War II began, Miami played an important role in the battle against German submarines due to its location on the southern coast of Florida. The war helped to increase Miami's population to almost half a million. After Fidel Castro rose to power in 1959, many Cubans emigrated to Miami, further increasing the population. In the 1980s and 1990s, various crises struck South Florida, among them the Arthur McDuffie beating and the subsequent riot, drug wars, Hurricane Andrew, and the Elián González affair. Despite these, Miami remains a major international, financial, and cultural center.%0a%0aThe city's name is derived from the Miami River, which is ultimately derived from the Mayaimi people who lived in the area at the time of European colonization.%0a%0aThough spelled the same in English, the Florida city's name has nothing to do with the Miami people who lived in a completely different part of North America.%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!%25center%25'''City History'''%0a%0aThe earliest evidence of Native American settlement in the Miami region came from about 10,000 years ago. The region was filled with pine hardwood forests and was home to plenty of deer, bear, and wild fowl. These first inhabitants settled on the banks of the Miami River, with their main villages on the northern banks. These early Native Americans created a variety of weapons and tools from shells.%0a%0aWhen the first Europeans visited in the mid-1500s, the inhabitants of the Miami area were the Tequesta people, who controlled an area covering much of southeastern Florida including what is now Miami-Dade County, Broward County, and the southern parts of Palm Beach County. The Tequesta Indians fished, hunted, and gathered the fruit and roots of plants for food, but did not practice any form of agriculture. They buried the small bones of the deceased, but put the larger bones in a box for the village people to see. The Tequesta are credited with making the Miami Circle.%0a%0a!!%25center%25''16th to 18th centuries: Early Spanish settlement''%0aIn 1513, Juan Ponce de León was the first European to visit the Miami area by sailing into Biscayne Bay. He wrote in his journal that he reached Chequescha, which was Miami's first recorded name, but it is unknown whether or not he came ashore or made contact with the natives. Pedro Menéndez de Avilés and his men made the first recorded landing in this area when they visited the Tequesta settlement in 1566 while looking for Avilés' missing son, who had been shipwrecked a year earlier. Spanish soldiers, led by Father Francisco Villareal, built a Jesuit mission at the mouth of the Miami River a year later, but it was short-lived. By 1570, the Jesuits decided to look for more willing subjects outside of Florida. After the Spaniards left, the Tequesta Indians were left to fight European-introduced diseases, such as smallpox, without European help. Wars with other tribes greatly weakened their population, and they were easily defeated by the Creek Indians in later battles. By 1711, the Tequesta had sent a couple of local chiefs to Havana to ask if they could migrate there. The Spanish sent two ships to help them, but their illnesses struck, killing most of their population. In 1743, the Spaniards sent another mission to Biscayne Bay, where they built a fort and church. The missionary priests proposed a permanent settlement, where the Spanish settlers would raise food for the soldiers and Native Americans. However, the proposal was rejected as impractical and the mission was withdrawn before the end of the year.%0a%0a!!%25center%25''18th to 19th centuries: Early non-Spanish settlement''%0aIn 1766, Samuel Touchett received a land grant from the British government of 20,000 acres (81 km2) in the Miami area. The grant was surveyed by Bernard Romans in 1772. A condition for making the grant permanent was that at least one white settler had to live on the grant for every 100 acres (0.4 km2) of land. While Touchett wanted to place a plantation on the grant, he was having financial problems and was never able to develop it.%0aThe first permanent European settlers in the Miami area arrived around 1800. Pedro Fornells, a Menorcan survivor of the New Smyrna colony, moved to Key Biscayne to meet the terms of his Royal Grant for the island. Although he returned with his family to St. Augustine after six months, he left a caretaker behind on the island. On a trip to the island in 1803, Fornells had noted the presence of squatters on the mainland across Biscayne Bay from the island. In 1825, U.S. Marshal Waters Smith visited the Cape Florida Settlement (which was on the mainland) and conferred with squatters who wanted to obtain title to the land they were occupying. On the mainland, the Bahamian "squatters" had settled along the coast beginning in the 1790s. John Egan had also received a grant from Spain during the Second Spanish Period. John's son James Egan, his wife Rebecca Egan, his widow Mary "Polly" Lewis, and Mary's brother-in-law Jonathan Lewis all received 640-acre land grants from the U.S. in present-day Miami. Temple Pent and his family did not receive a land grant, but nevertheless stayed in the area.%0a%0aTreasure hunters from the Bahamas and the Keys came to South Florida to hunt for treasure from the ships that ran aground on the treacherous Great Florida reef, some of whom accepted Spanish land offers along the Miami River. At about the same time, the Seminole Indians arrived along with a group of runaway slaves. In 1825, the Cape Florida Lighthouse was built on nearby Key Biscayne to warn passing ships of the dangerous reefs.%0a%0aIn 1830, Richard Fitzpatrick bought land on the Miami River from Bahamian James Egan. He built a plantation with slave labor where he cultivated sugarcane, bananas, maize, and tropical fruit. In January 1836, shortly after the beginning of the Second Seminole War, Fitzpatrick removed his slaves and closed his plantation.%0a%0aThe area was affected by the Second Seminole War, where Major William S. Harney led several raids against the Indians. Fort Dallas was located on Fitzpatrick's plantation on the north bank of the river. Most of the non-Indian population consisted of soldiers stationed at Fort Dallas. The Seminole War was the most devastating Indian war in American history,[citation needed] causing almost a total loss of native population in the Miami area. The Cape Florida lighthouse was burned by Seminoles in 1836 and was not repaired until 1846.%0a%0aAfter the Second Seminole War ended in 1842, Fitzpatrick's nephew, William English, re-established the plantation in Miami. He charted the "Village of Miami" on the south bank of the Miami River and sold several plots of land. When English died in California in 1852, his plantation died with him.%0a%0aThe Miami River lent its name to the burgeoning town, extending an etymology that derives from the Mayaimi Indian tribe. In 1844, Miami became the county seat, and six years later, a census reported that there were ninety-six residents living in the area. The Third Seminole War lasted from 1855 to 1858, but was not nearly as destructive as the previous one. However, it did slow down the rate of settlement of southeast Florida. At the end of the war, a few of the soldiers stayed and some of the Seminoles remained in the Everglades.%0a%0aFrom 1858 to 1896, only a handful of families made their homes in the Miami area. Those that did lived in small settlements along Biscayne Bay. The first of these settlements formed at the mouth of the Miami River and was variously called Miami, Miamuh, and Fort Dallas. Foremost among the Miami River settlers were the Brickells. William Brickell had previously lived in Cleveland, Ohio, California, and Australia, where he met his wife, Mary. In 1870, Brickell bought land on the south bank of the river. The Brickells and their children operated a trading post and post office on their property for the rest of the 19th century.%0a%0aOther settlements within Miami's city limits were Lemon City (now Little Haiti) and Coconut Grove. Settlements outside the city limits were Biscayne, in present-day Miami Shores, and Cutler, in present-day Palmetto Bay. Many of the settlers were homesteaders, attracted to the area by offers of 160 acres (0.6 km2) of free land by the United States federal government.%0a%0a%0a!!%25center%25''1890s: Fast growth and formation''%0a%0aIn 1891, a Cleveland woman named Julia Tuttle decided to move to South Florida to make a new start in her life after the death of her husband, Frederick Tuttle. She purchased 640 acres on the north bank of the Miami River in present-day downtown Miami.%0a%0aShe tried to persuade railroad magnate Henry Flagler to expand his rail line, the Florida East Coast Railway, southward to the area, but he initially declined. In December 1894, Florida was struck by a freeze that destroyed virtually the entire citrus crop in the northern half of the state. A few months later, on the night of February 7, 1895, the northern part of Florida was hit by another freeze that wiped out the remaining crops and the new trees. Unlike most of the rest of the state, the Miami area was unaffected. Tuttle wrote to Flagler again, asking him to visit the area and to see it for himself. Flagler sent James E. Ingraham to investigate and he returned with a favorable report and a box of orange blossoms to show that the area had escaped the frost. Flagler followed up with his own visit and concluded at the end of his first day that the area was ripe for expansion. He made the decision to extend his railroad to Miami and build a resort hotel.%0a%0aOn April 22, 1895, Flagler wrote Tuttle a long letter recapping her offer of land to him in exchange for extending his railroad to Miami, laying out a city and building a hotel. The terms provided that Tuttle would award Flagler a 100-acre (0.4 km2) tract of land for the city to grow. Around the same time, Flagler wrote a similar letter to William and Mary Brickell, who had also verbally agreed to give land during his visit.%0a%0aWhile the railroad's extension to Miami remained unannounced in the spring of 1895, rumors of this possibility continued to multiply, fueling real estate activity in the Biscayne Bay area. The news of the railroad's extension was officially announced on June 21, 1895. In late September, the work on the railroad began and settlers began pouring into the promised "freeze proof" lands. On October 24, 1895, the contract agreed upon by Flagler and Tuttle was approved.%0aWith the railroad under construction, activity in Miami began to pick up. Men from throughout Florida flocked to Miami to await Flagler's call for workers of all qualifications to begin work on the promised hotel and city. By late December 1895, seventy-five of them already were at work clearing the site for the hotel. They lived mostly in tents and huts in the wilderness, which had no streets and few cleared paths. Many of these men were victims of the freeze, which had left both money and work scarce.%0a%0aOn February 1, 1896, Tuttle fulfilled the first part of her agreement with Flagler by signing two deeds to transfer land for his hotel and the 100 acres (0.4 km2) of land near the hotel site to him. The titles to the Brickell and Tuttle properties were based on early Spanish land grants and had to be determined to be clear of conflict before the marketing of the Miami lots began. On March 3, Flagler hired John Sewell from West Palm Beach to begin work on the town as more people came into Miami. On April 7, 1896, the railroad tracks finally reached Miami and the first train arrived on April 13. It was a special, unscheduled train and Flagler was on board. The train returned to St. Augustine later that night. The first regularly scheduled train arrived on the night of April 15. The first week of train service provided only for freight trains; passenger service did not begin until April 22.%0a%0aOn July 28, 1896, the incorporation meeting to make Miami a city took place. The right to vote was restricted to all men who resided in Miami or Dade County. Joseph A. McDonald, Flagler's chief of construction on the Royal Palm Hotel, was elected chairman of the meeting. After ensuring that enough voters were present, the motion was made to incorporate and organize a city government under the corporate name of "The City of Miami", with the boundaries as proposed. John B. Reilly, who headed Flagler's Fort Dallas land company, was the first elected mayor.%0a%0aInitially, most residents wanted to name the city "Flagler". However, Henry Flagler was adamant that the new city would not be named after him. So on July 28, 1896, the City of Miami, named after the Miami River, was incorporated with 502 voters, including 100 registered black voters. The blacks provided the primary labor force for the building of Miami. Clauses in land deeds confined blacks to the northwest section of Miami, which became known as "Colored Town" (today's Overtown).%0a%0a!%25center%25'''Twentieth century'''%0a!!%25center%25''1900s to 1930s: The Magic City''%0a%0aMiami experienced a very rapid growth up to World War II. In 1900, 1,681 people lived in Miami, Florida; in 1910, there were 5,471 people; and in 1920, there were 29,549 people. As thousands of people moved to the area in the early 20th century, the need for more land quickly became apparent. Until then, the Florida Everglades only extended to three miles (5 km) west of Biscayne Bay. Beginning in 1906, canals were made to remove some of the water from those lands. Miami Beach was developed in 1913 when a two-mile (3 km) wooden bridge built by John Collins was completed. During the early 1920s, the authorities of Miami allowed gambling and were very lax in regulating prohibition, so thousands of people migrated from the northern United States to the Miami region. This caused the Florida land boom of the 1920s, when many high-rise buildings were built. Some early developments were razed after their initial construction to make way for larger buildings. The population of Miami doubled from 1920 to 1923. The nearby areas of Lemon City, Coconut Grove, and Allapattah were annexed in the fall of 1925, creating the Greater Miami area.%0a%0aHowever, this boom began to falter due to building construction delays and overload on the transport system caused by an excess of bulky building materials. On January 10, 1926 the Prinz Valdemar, an old Danish warship on its way to becoming a floating hotel, ran aground and blocked Miami Harbor for nearly a month. Already overloaded, the three major railway companies soon declared an embargo on all incoming goods except food. The cost of living had skyrocketed and finding an affordable place to live was nearly impossible. This economic bubble was already collapsing when the catastrophic Great Miami Hurricane in 1926 swept through, ending whatever was left of the boom. The Category 4 storm was the 12th most costly and 12th most deadly to strike the United States during the 20th century. According to the Red Cross, there were 373 fatalities, but other estimates vary, due to the large number of people listed as "missing". Between 25,000 and 50,000 people were left homeless in the Miami area. The Great Depression followed, causing more than sixteen thousand people in Miami to become unemployed. As a result, a Civilian Conservation Corps camp was opened in the area.%0a%0aDuring the mid-1930s, the Art Deco district of Miami Beach was developed. Also during this time, on February 15, 1933, an assassination attempt was made on President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt. While Roosevelt was giving a speech in Miami's Bayfront Park, Giuseppe Zangara, an Italian anarchist, opened fire. Mayor Anton Cermak of Chicago, who was shaking hands with Roosevelt, was shot and died two weeks later. Four other people were wounded, but President-elect Roosevelt was not harmed. Zangara was quickly tried for Cermak's murder and was executed by the electric chair on March 20, 1933 in Raiford, Florida.%0a%0aAlso in 1933, the Miami City Commission asked the Miami Women's Club to create a city flag design. The flag was designed by Charles L. Gmeinder on their behalf, and adopted by City Commission in November 1933. It is unknown why the orange and green colors were selected for the flag. One theory is that the colors were inspired by the orange tree, although the University of Miami was already using the colors of orange and green for their sports teams since 1926.%0a%0aIn 1937 the local Ku Klux Klan raided La Paloma, an LGBT nightclub. After the non-lethal raid the nightclub became a site of a more solidified LGBT community and resistance against conservative sexual laws.%0a%0a!!%25center%25''1940s: World War II''%0aBy the early 1940s, Miami was still recovering from the Great Depression when World War II started. Though many of the cities in Florida were heavily affected by the war and went into financial ruin, Miami remained relatively unaffected. Early in the war, German U-boats attacked several American ships including the Portero del Llano, which was attacked and sunk within sight of Miami Beach in May 1942. To defend against the U-boats, Miami was placed in two military districts, the Eastern Defense Command and the Seventh Naval District.%0a%0aIn February 1942, the Gulf Sea Frontier was established to help guard the waters around Florida. By June of that year, more attacks forced military leaders in Washington, D.C. to increase the numbers of ships and men of the army group. They also moved the headquarters from Key West to the DuPont building in Miami, taking advantage of its location at the southeastern corner of the U.S. As the war against the U-boats grew stronger, more military bases sprang up in the Miami area. The U.S. Navy took control of Miami's docks and established air stations at the Opa-locka Airport and in Dinner Key. The Air Force also set up bases in the local airports in the Miami area.%0a%0aIn addition, many military schools, supply stations, and communications facilities were established in the area. Rather than building large army bases to train the men needed to fight the war, the Army and Navy came to South Florida and converted hotels to barracks, movie theaters to classrooms, and local beaches and golf courses to training grounds. Overall, over five hundred thousand enlisted men and fifty thousand officers were trained in South Florida. After the end of the war, many servicemen and women returned to Miami, causing the population to rise to nearly half a million by 1950.%0a%0a!!%25center%25''1950s to 1970s.''%0a!!!%25center%25''First Cuban wave''%0aFollowing the 1959 Cuban revolution that unseated Fulgencio Batista and brought Fidel Castro to power, most Cubans who were living in Miami returned to Cuba. Soon after, however, many middle class and upper class Cubans moved to Florida en masse with few possessions. Some Miamians were upset about this, especially the African Americans, who believed that the Cuban workers were taking their jobs. In addition, the school systems struggled to educate the thousands of Spanish-speaking Cuban children. Many Miamians, fearing that the Cold War would become World War III, left the city, while others started building bomb shelters and stocking up on food and bottled water. Many of Miami's Cuban refugees realized for the first time that it would be a long time before they would get back to Cuba. In 1965 alone, 100,000 Cubans packed into the twice daily "freedom flights" from Havana to Miami. Most of the exiles settled into the Riverside neighborhood, which began to take on the new name of "Little Havana". This area emerged as a predominantly Spanish-speaking community, and Spanish speakers elsewhere in the city could conduct most of their daily business in their native tongue. By the end of the 1960s, more than four hundred thousand Cuban refugees were living in Dade County.%0a%0aIn the 1960s and 1970s, the Attorney General's authority was used to grant parole, or special permission, to allow Cubans to enter the country. However, parole only allows an individual permission to enter the country, not to stay permanently. To allow these immigrants to stay, the Cuban Adjustment Act was passed in 1966. This act provides that the immigration status of any Cuban who arrived since 1959 who has been physically present in the United States for at least a year "may be adjusted by the Attorney General to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence" (green card holder). The individual must be admissible to the United States (i.e., not disqualified on criminal or other grounds).%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Civil Rights Movement''%0a%0aAlthough Miami is not really considered a major center of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, it did not escape the change that occurred. Miami was a major city in the southern state of Florida, and had always had a substantial African American and black Caribbean population.%0a%0aOn August 7 and 8, 1968, coinciding with the 1968 Republican National Convention, rioting broke out in the black Liberty City neighborhood, which required the Florida National Guard to restore order. Issues were "deplorable housing conditions, economic exploitation, bleak employment prospects, racial discrimination, poor police-community relations, and economic competition with Cuban refugees.". Overcrowding due to the near-destruction of the black Overtown neighborhood was also a factor.%0a%0aDuring the 1970s, Miami was a news leader due to the response to a Dade County ordinance protecting individuals on the basis of sexual orientation. Opposition to this ordinance, which was repealed, was led by Florida orange juice spokeswoman, Anita Bryant.%0a%0aIn December 1979, police officers pursued motorcyclist Arthur McDuffie in a high-speed chase after McDuffie made a provocative gesture towards a police officer. The officers claimed that the chase ended when McDuffie crashed his motorcycle and died, but the coroner's report concluded otherwise. One of the officers testified that McDuffie fell off of his bike on an Interstate 95 on-ramp. When the police reached him he was injured but okay. The officers removed his helmet, beat him to death with their batons, put his helmet back on, and called an ambulance, claiming there had been a motorcycle accident. Eula McDuffie, the victim's mother, said to the Miami Herald a few days later, "They beat my son like a dog. They beat him just because he was riding a motorcycle and because he was black." A jury acquitted the officers after a brief deliberation.%0a%0aAfter learning of the verdict of the McDuffie case, one of the worst riots in the history of the United States, the Liberty City Riots of 1980, broke out. By the time the rioting ceased three days later, over 850 people had been arrested and at least 18 people had died. Property damage was estimated at around one hundred million dollars.%0a%0aIn March 1980, the first black Dade County schools superintendent, Dr. Johnny L. Jones, was convicted on grand theft charges linked to gold-plated plumbing. His conviction was overturned on appeal and, on July 3, 1986, the state attorney Janet Reno announced that Jones would not be retried on these charges. However, in a separate case, he was convicted on misdemeanor charges of soliciting perjury and witness tampering and received a two-year jail sentence.%0a%0a!!%25center%25''1980s and 1990s''%0a!!!%25center%25''Later immigration''%0aThe Mariel Boatlift of 1980 brought 150,000 Cubans to Miami, the largest transport in civilian history. Unlike the previous exodus of the 1960s, most of the Cuban refugees arriving were poor, some having been released from prisons or mental institutions to make the trip. During this time, many of the middle class non-Hispanic whites in the community left the city, often referred to as the "white flight". In 1960, Miami was 90%25 non-Hispanic white, but by 1990, it was only about 10%25 non-Hispanic white.%0a%0aIn the 1980s, Miami started to see an increase in immigrants from other nations, such as Haiti. As the Haitian population grew in Miami, the area known today as "Little Haiti" emerged, centered on Northeast Second Avenue and 54th Street. In 1985, Xavier Suarez was elected as Mayor of Miami, becoming the first Cuban mayor of a major city. In the 1990s, the presence of Haitians was acknowledged with Haitian Creole language signs in public places and ballots during voting.%0a%0aAnother major Cuban exodus occurred in 1994. To prevent it from becoming another Mariel Boatlift, the Clinton Administration announced a significant change in U.S. policy. In a controversial action, the administration announced that Cubans interdicted at sea would not be brought to the United States but instead would be taken by the Coast Guard to U.S. military installations at Guantanamo Bay or to Panama. During an eight-month period beginning in the summer of 1994, over 30,000 Cubans and more than 20,000 Haitians were interdicted and sent to live in camps outside the United States.%0a%0aOn September 9, 1994, the United States and Cuba agreed to normalize migration between the two countries. The agreement codified the new U.S. policy of placing Cuban refugees in safe havens outside the United States, while obtaining a commitment from Cuba to discourage Cubans from sailing to America. In addition, the United States committed to admitting a minimum of 20,000 Cuban immigrants per year. That number is in addition to the admission of immediate relatives of U.S. citizens.%0a%0aOn May 2, 1995, a second agreement with the Castro government paved the way for the admission to the United States of the Cubans housed at Guantanamo, who were counted primarily against the first year of the 20,000 annual admissions committed to by the Clinton Administration. It also established a new policy of directly repatriating Cubans interdicted at sea to Cuba. In the agreement, the Cuban government pledged not to retaliate against those who were repatriated.%0a%0aThese agreements with the Cuban government led to what has been called the Wet Foot-Dry Foot Policy, whereby Cubans who made it to shore could stay in the United States  likely becoming eligible to adjust to permanent residence under the Cuban Adjustment Act. However, those who do not make it to dry land ultimately are repatriated unless they can demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution if returned to Cuba. Because it was stated that Cubans were escaping for political reasons, this policy did not apply to Haitians, who the government claimed were seeking asylum for economic reasons.%0a%0aSince then, the Latin and Caribbean-friendly atmosphere in Miami has made it a popular destination for tourists and immigrants from all over the world. It is the third-biggest immigration port in the country after New York City and Los Angeles. In addition, large immigrant communities have settled in Miami from around the globe, including Europe, Africa, and Asia. The majority of Miami's European immigrant communities are recent immigrants, many living in the city seasonally, with a high disposable income.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Growth as a global city''%0aIn the 1980s, Miami became one of the United States' largest transshipment point for cocaine from Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru. The drug industry brought billions of dollars into Miami, which were quickly funneled through front organizations into the local economy. Luxury car dealerships, five-star hotels, condominium developments, swanky nightclubs, major commercial developments and other signs of prosperity began rising all over the city. As the money arrived, so did a violent crime wave that lasted through the early 1990s. The popular television program Miami Vice, which dealt with counter-narcotics agents in an idyllic upper-class rendition of Miami, spread the city's image as one of America's most glamorous subtropical paradises.%0a%0aMiami was host to many dignitaries and notable people throughout the 1980s and '90s. Pope John Paul II visited in November 1987, and held an open-air mass for 150,000 people in Tamiami Park. Queen Elizabeth II and three United States presidents also visited Miami. Among them is Ronald Reagan, who has a street named after him in Little Havana. Nelson Mandela's 1989 visit to the city was marked by ethnic tensions. Mandela had praised Cuban leader Fidel Castro for his anti-apartheid support on ABC News' Nightline. Because of this, the city withdrew its official greeting and no high-ranking official welcomed him. This led to a boycott by the local African American community of all Miami tourist and convention facilities until Mandela received an official greeting. However, all efforts to resolve it failed for months, resulting in an estimated loss of over US$10 million.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''1990s''%0aIn 1992 Hurricane Andrew, caused more than $20 billion in damage just south of the Miami-Dade area.%0a%0aSeveral financial scandals involving the Mayor's office and City Commission during the 1980s and 1990s left Miami with the title of the United States' 4th poorest city by 1996. With a budget shortfall of $68 Million and its municipal bonds given a junk bond rating by Wall Street, in 1997, Miami became Florida's first city to have a state appointed oversight board assigned to it. In the same year, city voters rejected a resolution to dissolve the city and make it one entity with Dade County. The City's financial problems continued until political outsider Manny Diaz was elected Mayor of Miami in 2001.%0a%0a!%25center%25'''Twenty-first century'''%0a!!%25center%25''2000s: A new era''%0a%0aIn 2000, the Elián González affair was an immigration battle in the Miami area. The controversy concerned six-year-old Elián González who was rescued from the waters off the coast of Miami. The U.S. and the Cuban governments, his father Juan Miguel González, his Miami relatives, and the Cuban-American community of Miami were all involved. The climactic stage of this prolonged battle was the April 22, 2000, seizure of Elián by federal agents, which drew the criticism of many in the Cuban-American community. During the controversy, Alex Penelas, the mayor of Miami-Dade County at the time, vowed that he would do nothing to assist the Bill Clinton administration and federal authorities in their bid to return the six-year-old boy to Cuba. Tens of thousands of protesters, many of whom were outraged at the raid, poured out into the streets of Little Havana and demonstrated. Car horns blared, demonstrators turned over signs, trash cans, and newspaper racks and some small fires were started. Rioters jammed a 10-block area of Little Havana. Shortly afterwards, many Miami businesses closed, as their owners and managers participated in a short, one-day boycott against the city, attempting to affect its tourism industry. Employees of airlines, cruise lines, hotels, car rental companies, and major retailers participated in the boycott. Elián González returned to Cuba with his father on June 28, 2000.%0a%0aIn 2003, the controversial Free Trade Area of the Americas negotiation occurred. It was a proposed agreement to reduce trade barriers while increasing intellectual property rights. During the 2003 meeting in Miami, the Free Trade Area of the Americas was met by heavy opposition from anti-corporatization and anti-globalization protests.%0a%0aOn June 27, 2005, the popular ex-city commissioner Arthur Teele walked into the main lobby of the Miami Herald headquarters, dropped off a package for columnist Jim DeFede, and told the security guard to tell his wife Stephanie he "loved her", before pulling out a gun and committing suicide. His suicide happened the day the alternative weekly Miami New Times published salacious details of Teele's alleged affairs, including allegations that Teele had sex with a transsexual prostitute and used cocaine. At the time, Teele was being investigated by federal authorities for fraud and money laundering for allegedly taking $59,000 in kickbacks to help a businessman get millions of dollars in contracts at Miami International Airport. Teele was suspended from his job in 2004 by Florida governor Jeb Bush after being arrested for trying to run a police officer off the road. Teele was also charged in December 2004 with ten counts of unlawful compensation on charges he took $135,000 from TLMC Inc., promising that it would be awarded lucrative contracts to redevelop neighborhoods in Miami. Teele was also found guilty in March 2005 for threatening an undercover detective.%0a%0aIn the latter half of the 20002010 decade, Miami saw an extensive boom of high rise architecture, dubbed a "Miami Manhattanization" wave. This included the construction of many of the tallest buildings in Miami, with nearly 20 of the cities tallest 25 buildings finished after 2005. 2008 and 2007 saw the completion of even more of these buildings. This boom transformed the look of downtown Miami, which is now considered to have one of the largest skylines in the United States, ranked behind New York City and Chicago.[A] This boom slowed after the 2008 global financial crisis, with some projects being put on hold and none of the cities tallest buildings being constructed in 2010.%0a%0aThe Port Miami Tunnel connecting Watson Island to PortMiami on Dodge Island, which cost $700 million, was opened in 2014.%0a%0aIn the 2010s, there was a second skyscraper building boom.%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a%0a!%25center%25'''City Time Line'''%0a%0a!!!'''History of Miami Florida'''%0a'''1567'''%0a*A Spanish mission was among the few significant buildings at the Miami River's mouth for several centuries.

The Tequesta (also Tekesta, Tegesta, Chequesta, Vizcaynos) Native American tribe, at the time of first European contact, occupied an area along the southeastern Atlantic coast of Florida. They had infrequent contact with Europeans and had largely migrated by the middle of the 18th century. Miami is named after the Mayaimi, a Native American tribe that lived around Lake Okeechobee until the 17th or 18th century.%0a%3c %0a%3c In 1566, Pedro Menéndez de Avilés was sent by the Spanish monarchy to remove the French from Florida who had already established several colonies. Although Menéndez left behind two Jesuit missionaries in an attempt to convert the Tequesta to Roman Catholicism, the tribe were indifferent to their teachings. The Jesuits returned to St. Augustine after a year. Fort Dallas was built in 1836 and functioned as a military base during the Second Seminole War.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Miami area was better known as "Biscayne Bay Country" in the early years of its growth. The few published accounts from that period describe the area as a wilderness that held much promise. The area was also characterized as "one of the finest building sites in Florida". After the Great Freeze of 1894, the crops of the Miami area were the only ones in Florida that survived. Julia Tuttle, a local landowner, convinced Henry Flagler, a railroad tycoon, to expand his Florida East Coast Railway to Miami. On July 28, 1896, Miami was officially incorporated as a city with a population of just over 300.%0a%3c %0a%3c Miami prospered during the 1920s, but weakened when the real-estate bubble burst in 1925, which was shortly followed by the 1926 Miami Hurricane and the Great Depression in the 1930s. When World War II began, Miami played an important role in the battle against German submarines due to its location on the southern coast of Florida. The war helped to increase Miami's population to almost half a million. After Fidel Castro rose to power in 1959, many Cubans emigrated to Miami, further increasing the population. In the 1980s and 1990s, various crises struck South Florida, among them the Arthur McDuffie beating and the subsequent riot, drug wars, Hurricane Andrew, and the Elián González affair. Despite these, Miami remains a major international, financial, and cultural center.%0a%3c %0a%3c The city's name is derived from the Miami River, which is ultimately derived from the Mayaimi people who lived in the area at the time of European colonization.%0a%3c %0a%3c Though spelled the same in English, the Florida city's name has nothing to do with the Miami people who lived in a completely different part of North America.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

The region was filled with pine hardwood forests and was home to plenty of deer, bear, and wild fowl. These first inhabitants settled on the banks of the Miami River, with their main villages on the northern banks. These early Native Americans created a variety of weapons and tools from shells.%0a%3c %0a%3c When the first Europeans visited in the mid-1500s, the inhabitants of the Miami area were the Tequesta people, who controlled an area covering much of southeastern Florida including what is now Miami-Dade County, Broward County, and the southern parts of Palm Beach County. The Tequesta Indians fished, hunted, and gathered the fruit and roots of plants for food, but did not practice any form of agriculture. They buried the small bones of the deceased, but put the larger bones in a box for the village people to see. The Tequesta are credited with making the Miami Circle.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25''16th to 18th centuries: Early Spanish settlement''%0a%3c In 1513, Juan Ponce de León was the first European to visit the Miami area by sailing into Biscayne Bay. He wrote in his journal that he reached Chequescha, which was Miami's first recorded name, but it is unknown whether or not he came ashore or made contact with the natives. Pedro Menéndez de Avilés and his men made the first recorded landing in this area when they visited the Tequesta settlement in 1566 while looking for Avilés' missing son, who had been shipwrecked a year earlier. Spanish soldiers, led by Father Francisco Villareal, built a Jesuit mission at the mouth of the Miami River a year later, but it was short-lived. By 1570, the Jesuits decided to look for more willing subjects outside of Florida. After the Spaniards left, the Tequesta Indians were left to fight European-introduced diseases, such as smallpox, without European help. Wars with other tribes greatly weakened their population, and they were easily defeated by the Creek Indians in later battles. By 1711, the Tequesta had sent a couple of local chiefs to Havana to ask if they could migrate there. The Spanish sent two ships to help them, but their illnesses struck, killing most of their population. In 1743, the Spaniards sent another mission to Biscayne Bay, where they built a fort and church. The missionary priests proposed a permanent settlement, where the Spanish settlers would raise food for the soldiers and Native Americans. However, the proposal was rejected as impractical and the mission was withdrawn before the end of the year.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25''18th to 19th centuries: Early non-Spanish settlement''%0a%3c In 1766, Samuel Touchett received a land grant from the British government of 20,000 acres (81 km2) in the Miami area. The grant was surveyed by Bernard Romans in 1772. A condition for making the grant permanent was that at least one white settler had to live on the grant for every 100 acres (0.4 km2) of land. While Touchett wanted to place a plantation on the grant, he was having financial problems and was never able to develop it.%0a%3c The first permanent European settlers in the Miami area arrived around 1800. Pedro Fornells, a Menorcan survivor of the New Smyrna colony, moved to Key Biscayne to meet the terms of his Royal Grant for the island. Although he returned with his family to St. Augustine after six months, he left a caretaker behind on the island. On a trip to the island in 1803, Fornells had noted the presence of squatters on the mainland across Biscayne Bay from the island. In 1825, U.S. Marshal Waters Smith visited the Cape Florida Settlement (which was on the mainland) and conferred with squatters who wanted to obtain title to the land they were occupying. On the mainland, the Bahamian "squatters" had settled along the coast beginning in the 1790s. John Egan had also received a grant from Spain during the Second Spanish Period. John's son James Egan, his wife Rebecca Egan, his widow Mary "Polly" Lewis, and Mary's brother-in-law Jonathan Lewis all received 640-acre land grants from the U.S. in present-day Miami. Temple Pent and his family did not receive a land grant, but nevertheless stayed in the area.%0a%3c %0a%3c Treasure hunters from the Bahamas and the Keys came to South Florida to hunt for treasure from the ships that ran aground on the treacherous Great Florida reef, some of whom accepted Spanish land offers along the Miami River. At about the same time, the Seminole Indians arrived along with a group of runaway slaves. In 1825, the Cape Florida Lighthouse was built on nearby Key Biscayne to warn passing ships of the dangerous reefs.%0a%3c %0a%3c In 1830, Richard Fitzpatrick bought land on the Miami River from Bahamian James Egan. He built a plantation with slave labor where he cultivated sugarcane, bananas, maize, and tropical fruit. In January 1836, shortly after the beginning of the Second Seminole War, Fitzpatrick removed his slaves and closed his plantation.%0a%3c %0a%3c The area was affected by the Second Seminole War, where Major William S. Harney led several raids against the Indians. Fort Dallas was located on Fitzpatrick's plantation on the north bank of the river. Most of the non-Indian population consisted of soldiers stationed at Fort Dallas. The Seminole War was the most devastating Indian war in American history,[citation needed] causing almost a total loss of native population in the Miami area. The Cape Florida lighthouse was burned by Seminoles in 1836 and was not repaired until 1846.%0a%3c %0a%3c After the Second Seminole War ended in 1842, Fitzpatrick's nephew, William English, re-established the plantation in Miami. He charted the "Village of Miami" on the south bank of the Miami River and sold several plots of land. When English died in California in 1852, his plantation died with him.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Miami River lent its name to the burgeoning town, extending an etymology that derives from the Mayaimi Indian tribe. In 1844, Miami became the county seat, and six years later, a census reported that there were ninety-six residents living in the area. The Third Seminole War lasted from 1855 to 1858, but was not nearly as destructive as the previous one. However, it did slow down the rate of settlement of southeast Florida. At the end of the war, a few of the soldiers stayed and some of the Seminoles remained in the Everglades.%0a%3c %0a%3c From 1858 to 1896, only a handful of families made their homes in the Miami area. Those that did lived in small settlements along Biscayne Bay. The first of these settlements formed at the mouth of the Miami River and was variously called Miami, Miamuh, and Fort Dallas. Foremost among the Miami River settlers were the Brickells. William Brickell had previously lived in Cleveland, Ohio, California, and Australia, where he met his wife, Mary. In 1870, Brickell bought land on the south bank of the river. The Brickells and their children operated a trading post and post office on their property for the rest of the 19th century.%0a%3c %0a%3c Other settlements within Miami's city limits were Lemon City (now Little Haiti) and Coconut Grove. Settlements outside the city limits were Biscayne, in present-day Miami Shores, and Cutler, in present-day Palmetto Bay. Many of the settlers were homesteaders, attracted to the area by offers of 160 acres (0.6 km2) of free land by the United States federal government.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25''1890s: Fast growth and formation''%0a%3c %0a%3c In 1891, a Cleveland woman named Julia Tuttle decided to move to South Florida to make a new start in her life after the death of her husband, Frederick Tuttle. She purchased 640 acres on the north bank of the Miami River in present-day downtown Miami.%0a%3c %0a%3c She tried to persuade railroad magnate Henry Flagler to expand his rail line, the Florida East Coast Railway, southward to the area, but he initially declined. In December 1894, Florida was struck by a freeze that destroyed virtually the entire citrus crop in the northern half of the state. A few months later, on the night of February 7, 1895, the northern part of Florida was hit by another freeze that wiped out the remaining crops and the new trees. Unlike most of the rest of the state, the Miami area was unaffected. Tuttle wrote to Flagler again, asking him to visit the area and to see it for himself. Flagler sent James E. Ingraham to investigate and he returned with a favorable report and a box of orange blossoms to show that the area had escaped the frost. Flagler followed up with his own visit and concluded at the end of his first day that the area was ripe for expansion. He made the decision to extend his railroad to Miami and build a resort hotel.%0a%3c %0a%3c On April 22, 1895, Flagler wrote Tuttle a long letter recapping her offer of land to him in exchange for extending his railroad to Miami, laying out a city and building a hotel. The terms provided that Tuttle would award Flagler a 100-acre (0.4 km2) tract of land for the city to grow. Around the same time, Flagler wrote a similar letter to William and Mary Brickell, who had also verbally agreed to give land during his visit.%0a%3c %0a%3c While the railroad's extension to Miami remained unannounced in the spring of 1895, rumors of this possibility continued to multiply, fueling real estate activity in the Biscayne Bay area. The news of the railroad's extension was officially announced on June 21, 1895. In late September, the work on the railroad began and settlers began pouring into the promised "freeze proof" lands. On October 24, 1895, the contract agreed upon by Flagler and Tuttle was approved.%0a%3c With the railroad under construction, activity in Miami began to pick up. Men from throughout Florida flocked to Miami to await Flagler's call for workers of all qualifications to begin work on the promised hotel and city. By late December 1895, seventy-five of them already were at work clearing the site for the hotel. They lived mostly in tents and huts in the wilderness, which had no streets and few cleared paths. Many of these men were victims of the freeze, which had left both money and work scarce.%0a%3c %0a%3c On February 1, 1896, Tuttle fulfilled the first part of her agreement with Flagler by signing two deeds to transfer land for his hotel and the 100 acres (0.4 km2) of land near the hotel site to him. The titles to the Brickell and Tuttle properties were based on early Spanish land grants and had to be determined to be clear of conflict before the marketing of the Miami lots began. On March 3, Flagler hired John Sewell from West Palm Beach to begin work on the town as more people came into Miami. On April 7, 1896, the railroad tracks finally reached Miami and the first train arrived on April 13. It was a special, unscheduled train and Flagler was on board. The train returned to St. Augustine later that night. The first regularly scheduled train arrived on the night of April 15. The first week of train service provided only for freight trains; passenger service did not begin until April 22.%0a%3c %0a%3c On July 28, 1896, the incorporation meeting to make Miami a city took place. The right to vote was restricted to all men who resided in Miami or Dade County. Joseph A. McDonald, Flagler's chief of construction on the Royal Palm Hotel, was elected chairman of the meeting. After ensuring that enough voters were present, the motion was made to incorporate and organize a city government under the corporate name of "The City of Miami", with the boundaries as proposed. John B. Reilly, who headed Flagler's Fort Dallas land company, was the first elected mayor.%0a%3c %0a%3c Initially, most residents wanted to name the city "Flagler". However, Henry Flagler was adamant that the new city would not be named after him. So on July 28, 1896, the City of Miami, named after the Miami River, was incorporated with 502 voters, including 100 registered black voters. The blacks provided the primary labor force for the building of Miami. Clauses in land deeds confined blacks to the northwest section of Miami, which became known as "Colored Town" (today's Overtown).%0a%3c %0a%3c !%25center%25'''Twentieth century'''%0a%3c !!%25center%25''1900s to 1930s: The Magic City''%0a%3c %0a%3c Miami experienced a very rapid growth up to World War II. In 1900, 1,681 people lived in Miami, Florida; in 1910, there were 5,471 people; and in 1920, there were 29,549 people. As thousands of people moved to the area in the early 20th century, the need for more land quickly became apparent. Until then, the Florida Everglades only extended to three miles (5 km) west of Biscayne Bay. Beginning in 1906, canals were made to remove some of the water from those lands. Miami Beach was developed in 1913 when a two-mile (3 km) wooden bridge built by John Collins was completed. During the early 1920s, the authorities of Miami allowed gambling and were very lax in regulating prohibition, so thousands of people migrated from the northern United States to the Miami region. This caused the Florida land boom of the 1920s, when many high-rise buildings were built. Some early developments were razed after their initial construction to make way for larger buildings. The population of Miami doubled from 1920 to 1923. The nearby areas of Lemon City, Coconut Grove, and Allapattah were annexed in the fall of 1925, creating the Greater Miami area.%0a%3c %0a%3c However, this boom began to falter due to building construction delays and overload on the transport system caused by an excess of bulky building materials. On January 10, 1926 the Prinz Valdemar, an old Danish warship on its way to becoming a floating hotel, ran aground and blocked Miami Harbor for nearly a month. Already overloaded, the three major railway companies soon declared an embargo on all incoming goods except food. The cost of living had skyrocketed and finding an affordable place to live was nearly impossible. This economic bubble was already collapsing when the catastrophic Great Miami Hurricane in 1926 swept through, ending whatever was left of the boom. The Category 4 storm was the 12th most costly and 12th most deadly to strike the United States during the 20th century. According to the Red Cross, there were 373 fatalities, but other estimates vary, due to the large number of people listed as "missing". Between 25,000 and 50,000 people were left homeless in the Miami area. The Great Depression followed, causing more than sixteen thousand people in Miami to become unemployed. As a result, a Civilian Conservation Corps camp was opened in the area.%0a%3c %0a%3c During the mid-1930s, the Art Deco district of Miami Beach was developed. Also during this time, on February 15, 1933, an assassination attempt was made on President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt. While Roosevelt was giving a speech in Miami's Bayfront Park, Giuseppe Zangara, an Italian anarchist, opened fire. Mayor Anton Cermak of Chicago, who was shaking hands with Roosevelt, was shot and died two weeks later. Four other people were wounded, but President-elect Roosevelt was not harmed. Zangara was quickly tried for Cermak's murder and was executed by the electric chair on March 20, 1933 in Raiford, Florida.%0a%3c %0a%3c Also in 1933, the Miami City Commission asked the Miami Women's Club to create a city flag design. The flag was designed by Charles L. Gmeinder on their behalf, and adopted by City Commission in November 1933. It is unknown why the orange and green colors were selected for the flag. One theory is that the colors were inspired by the orange tree, although the University of Miami was already using the colors of orange and green for their sports teams since 1926.%0a%3c %0a%3c In 1937 the local Ku Klux Klan raided La Paloma, an LGBT nightclub. After the non-lethal raid the nightclub became a site of a more solidified LGBT community and resistance against conservative sexual laws.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25''1940s: World War II''%0a%3c By the early 1940s, Miami was still recovering from the Great Depression when World War II started. Though many of the cities in Florida were heavily affected by the war and went into financial ruin, Miami remained relatively unaffected. Early in the war, German U-boats attacked several American ships including the Portero del Llano, which was attacked and sunk within sight of Miami Beach in May 1942. To defend against the U-boats, Miami was placed in two military districts, the Eastern Defense Command and the Seventh Naval District.%0a%3c %0a%3c In February 1942, the Gulf Sea Frontier was established to help guard the waters around Florida. By June of that year, more attacks forced military leaders in Washington, D.C. to increase the numbers of ships and men of the army group. They also moved the headquarters from Key West to the DuPont building in Miami, taking advantage of its location at the southeastern corner of the U.S. As the war against the U-boats grew stronger, more military bases sprang up in the Miami area. The U.S. Navy took control of Miami's docks and established air stations at the Opa-locka Airport and in Dinner Key. The Air Force also set up bases in the local airports in the Miami area.%0a%3c %0a%3c In addition, many military schools, supply stations, and communications facilities were established in the area. Rather than building large army bases to train the men needed to fight the war, the Army and Navy came to South Florida and converted hotels to barracks, movie theaters to classrooms, and local beaches and golf courses to training grounds. Overall, over five hundred thousand enlisted men and fifty thousand officers were trained in South Florida. After the end of the war, many servicemen and women returned to Miami, causing the population to rise to nearly half a million by 1950.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25''1950s to 1970s.''%0a%3c !!!%25center%25''First Cuban wave''%0a%3c Following the 1959 Cuban revolution that unseated Fulgencio Batista and brought Fidel Castro to power, most Cubans who were living in Miami returned to Cuba. Soon after, however, many middle class and upper class Cubans moved to Florida en masse with few possessions. Some Miamians were upset about this, especially the African Americans, who believed that the Cuban workers were taking their jobs. In addition, the school systems struggled to educate the thousands of Spanish-speaking Cuban children. Many Miamians, fearing that the Cold War would become World War III, left the city, while others started building bomb shelters and stocking up on food and bottled water. Many of Miami's Cuban refugees realized for the first time that it would be a long time before they would get back to Cuba. In 1965 alone, 100,000 Cubans packed into the twice daily "freedom flights" from Havana to Miami. Most of the exiles settled into the Riverside neighborhood, which began to take on the new name of "Little Havana". This area emerged as a predominantly Spanish-speaking community, and Spanish speakers elsewhere in the city could conduct most of their daily business in their native tongue. By the end of the 1960s, more than four hundred thousand Cuban refugees were living in Dade County.%0a%3c %0a%3c In the 1960s and 1970s, the Attorney General's authority was used to grant parole, or special permission, to allow Cubans to enter the country. However, parole only allows an individual permission to enter the country, not to stay permanently. To allow these immigrants to stay, the Cuban Adjustment Act was passed in 1966. This act provides that the immigration status of any Cuban who arrived since 1959 who has been physically present in the United States for at least a year "may be adjusted by the Attorney General to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence" (green card holder). The individual must be admissible to the United States (i.e., not disqualified on criminal or other grounds).%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25''Civil Rights Movement''%0a%3c %0a%3c Although Miami is not really considered a major center of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, it did not escape the change that occurred. Miami was a major city in the southern state of Florida, and had always had a substantial African American and black Caribbean population.%0a%3c %0a%3c On August 7 and 8, 1968, coinciding with the 1968 Republican National Convention, rioting broke out in the black Liberty City neighborhood, which required the Florida National Guard to restore order. Issues were "deplorable housing conditions, economic exploitation, bleak employment prospects, racial discrimination, poor police-community relations, and economic competition with Cuban refugees.". Overcrowding due to the near-destruction of the black Overtown neighborhood was also a factor.%0a%3c %0a%3c During the 1970s, Miami was a news leader due to the response to a Dade County ordinance protecting individuals on the basis of sexual orientation. Opposition to this ordinance, which was repealed, was led by Florida orange juice spokeswoman, Anita Bryant.%0a%3c %0a%3c In December 1979, police officers pursued motorcyclist Arthur McDuffie in a high-speed chase after McDuffie made a provocative gesture towards a police officer. The officers claimed that the chase ended when McDuffie crashed his motorcycle and died, but the coroner's report concluded otherwise. One of the officers testified that McDuffie fell off of his bike on an Interstate 95 on-ramp. When the police reached him he was injured but okay. The officers removed his helmet, beat him to death with their batons, put his helmet back on, and called an ambulance, claiming there had been a motorcycle accident. Eula McDuffie, the victim's mother, said to the Miami Herald a few days later, "They beat my son like a dog. They beat him just because he was riding a motorcycle and because he was black." A jury acquitted the officers after a brief deliberation.%0a%3c %0a%3c After learning of the verdict of the McDuffie case, one of the worst riots in the history of the United States, the Liberty City Riots of 1980, broke out. By the time the rioting ceased three days later, over 850 people had been arrested and at least 18 people had died. Property damage was estimated at around one hundred million dollars.%0a%3c %0a%3c In March 1980, the first black Dade County schools superintendent, Dr. Johnny L. Jones, was convicted on grand theft charges linked to gold-plated plumbing. His conviction was overturned on appeal and, on July 3, 1986, the state attorney Janet Reno announced that Jones would not be retried on these charges. However, in a separate case, he was convicted on misdemeanor charges of soliciting perjury and witness tampering and received a two-year jail sentence.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25''1980s and 1990s''%0a%3c !!!%25center%25''Later immigration''%0a%3c The Mariel Boatlift of 1980 brought 150,000 Cubans to Miami, the largest transport in civilian history. Unlike the previous exodus of the 1960s, most of the Cuban refugees arriving were poor, some having been released from prisons or mental institutions to make the trip. During this time, many of the middle class non-Hispanic whites in the community left the city, often referred to as the "white flight". In 1960, Miami was 90%25 non-Hispanic white, but by 1990, it was only about 10%25 non-Hispanic white.%0a%3c %0a%3c In the 1980s, Miami started to see an increase in immigrants from other nations, such as Haiti. As the Haitian population grew in Miami, the area known today as "Little Haiti" emerged, centered on Northeast Second Avenue and 54th Street. In 1985, Xavier Suarez was elected as Mayor of Miami, becoming the first Cuban mayor of a major city. In the 1990s, the presence of Haitians was acknowledged with Haitian Creole language signs in public places and ballots during voting.%0a%3c %0a%3c Another major Cuban exodus occurred in 1994. To prevent it from becoming another Mariel Boatlift, the Clinton Administration announced a significant change in U.S. policy. In a controversial action, the administration announced that Cubans interdicted at sea would not be brought to the United States but instead would be taken by the Coast Guard to U.S. military installations at Guantanamo Bay or to Panama. During an eight-month period beginning in the summer of 1994, over 30,000 Cubans and more than 20,000 Haitians were interdicted and sent to live in camps outside the United States.%0a%3c %0a%3c On September 9, 1994, the United States and Cuba agreed to normalize migration between the two countries. The agreement codified the new U.S. policy of placing Cuban refugees in safe havens outside the United States, while obtaining a commitment from Cuba to discourage Cubans from sailing to America. In addition, the United States committed to admitting a minimum of 20,000 Cuban immigrants per year. That number is in addition to the admission of immediate relatives of U.S. citizens.%0a%3c %0a%3c On May 2, 1995, a second agreement with the Castro government paved the way for the admission to the United States of the Cubans housed at Guantanamo, who were counted primarily against the first year of the 20,000 annual admissions committed to by the Clinton Administration. It also established a new policy of directly repatriating Cubans interdicted at sea to Cuba. In the agreement, the Cuban government pledged not to retaliate against those who were repatriated.%0a%3c %0a%3c These agreements with the Cuban government led to what has been called the Wet Foot-Dry Foot Policy, whereby Cubans who made it to shore could stay in the United States  likely becoming eligible to adjust to permanent residence under the Cuban Adjustment Act. However, those who do not make it to dry land ultimately are repatriated unless they can demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution if returned to Cuba. Because it was stated that Cubans were escaping for political reasons, this policy did not apply to Haitians, who the government claimed were seeking asylum for economic reasons.%0a%3c %0a%3c Since then, the Latin and Caribbean-friendly atmosphere in Miami has made it a popular destination for tourists and immigrants from all over the world. It is the third-biggest immigration port in the country after New York City and Los Angeles. In addition, large immigrant communities have settled in Miami from around the globe, including Europe, Africa, and Asia. The majority of Miami's European immigrant communities are recent immigrants, many living in the city seasonally, with a high disposable income.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25''Growth as a global city''%0a%3c In the 1980s, Miami became one of the United States' largest transshipment point for cocaine from Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru. The drug industry brought billions of dollars into Miami, which were quickly funneled through front organizations into the local economy. Luxury car dealerships, five-star hotels, condominium developments, swanky nightclubs, major commercial developments and other signs of prosperity began rising all over the city. As the money arrived, so did a violent crime wave that lasted through the early 1990s. The popular television program Miami Vice, which dealt with counter-narcotics agents in an idyllic upper-class rendition of Miami, spread the city's image as one of America's most glamorous subtropical paradises.%0a%3c %0a%3c Miami was host to many dignitaries and notable people throughout the 1980s and '90s. Pope John Paul II visited in November 1987, and held an open-air mass for 150,000 people in Tamiami Park. Queen Elizabeth II and three United States presidents also visited Miami. Among them is Ronald Reagan, who has a street named after him in Little Havana. Nelson Mandela's 1989 visit to the city was marked by ethnic tensions. Mandela had praised Cuban leader Fidel Castro for his anti-apartheid support on ABC News' Nightline. Because of this, the city withdrew its official greeting and no high-ranking official welcomed him. This led to a boycott by the local African American community of all Miami tourist and convention facilities until Mandela received an official greeting. However, all efforts to resolve it failed for months, resulting in an estimated loss of over US$10 million.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25''1990s''%0a%3c In 1992 Hurricane Andrew, caused more than $20 billion in damage just south of the Miami-Dade area.%0a%3c %0a%3c Several financial scandals involving the Mayor's office and City Commission during the 1980s and 1990s left Miami with the title of the United States' 4th poorest city by 1996. With a budget shortfall of $68 Million and its municipal bonds given a junk bond rating by Wall Street, in 1997, Miami became Florida's first city to have a state appointed oversight board assigned to it. In the same year, city voters rejected a resolution to dissolve the city and make it one entity with Dade County. The City's financial problems continued until political outsider Manny Diaz was elected Mayor of Miami in 2001.%0a%3c %0a%3c !%25center%25'''Twenty-first century'''%0a%3c !!%25center%25''2000s: A new era''%0a%3c %0a%3c In 2000, the Elián González affair was an immigration battle in the Miami area. The controversy concerned six-year-old Elián González who was rescued from the waters off the coast of Miami. The U.S. and the Cuban governments, his father Juan Miguel González, his Miami relatives, and the Cuban-American community of Miami were all involved. The climactic stage of this prolonged battle was the April 22, 2000, seizure of Elián by federal agents, which drew the criticism of many in the Cuban-American community. During the controversy, Alex Penelas, the mayor of Miami-Dade County at the time, vowed that he would do nothing to assist the Bill Clinton administration and federal authorities in their bid to return the six-year-old boy to Cuba. Tens of thousands of protesters, many of whom were outraged at the raid, poured out into the streets of Little Havana and demonstrated. Car horns blared, demonstrators turned over signs, trash cans, and newspaper racks and some small fires were started. Rioters jammed a 10-block area of Little Havana. Shortly afterwards, many Miami businesses closed, as their owners and managers participated in a short, one-day boycott against the city, attempting to affect its tourism industry. Employees of airlines, cruise lines, hotels, car rental companies, and major retailers participated in the boycott. Elián González returned to Cuba with his father on June 28, 2000.%0a%3c %0a%3c In 2003, the controversial Free Trade Area of the Americas negotiation occurred. It was a proposed agreement to reduce trade barriers while increasing intellectual property rights. During the 2003 meeting in Miami, the Free Trade Area of the Americas was met by heavy opposition from anti-corporatization and anti-globalization protests.%0a%3c %0a%3c On June 27, 2005, the popular ex-city commissioner Arthur Teele walked into the main lobby of the Miami Herald headquarters, dropped off a package for columnist Jim DeFede, and told the security guard to tell his wife Stephanie he "loved her", before pulling out a gun and committing suicide. His suicide happened the day the alternative weekly Miami New Times published salacious details of Teele's alleged affairs, including allegations that Teele had sex with a transsexual prostitute and used cocaine. At the time, Teele was being investigated by federal authorities for fraud and money laundering for allegedly taking $59,000 in kickbacks to help a businessman get millions of dollars in contracts at Miami International Airport. Teele was suspended from his job in 2004 by Florida governor Jeb Bush after being arrested for trying to run a police officer off the road. Teele was also charged in December 2004 with ten counts of unlawful compensation on charges he took $135,000 from TLMC Inc., promising that it would be awarded lucrative contracts to redevelop neighborhoods in Miami. Teele was also found guilty in March 2005 for threatening an undercover detective.%0a%3c %0a%3c In the latter half of the 20002010 decade, Miami saw an extensive boom of high rise architecture, dubbed a "Miami Manhattanization" wave. This included the construction of many of the tallest buildings in Miami, with nearly 20 of the cities tallest 25 buildings finished after 2005. 2008 and 2007 saw the completion of even more of these buildings. This boom transformed the look of downtown Miami, which is now considered to have one of the largest skylines in the United States, ranked behind New York City and Chicago.[A] This boom slowed after the 2008 global financial crisis, with some projects being put on hold and none of the cities tallest buildings being constructed in 2010.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Port Miami Tunnel connecting Watson Island to PortMiami on Dodge Island, which cost $700 million, was opened in 2014.%0a%3c %0a%3c In the 2010s, there was a second skyscraper building boom.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !%25center%25''City Time Line''%0a---%0a> !!%25center%25''City Time Line''%0a

The freehold itself adopts a policy of extreme secrecy in order to protect those who refuse to answer the draft.

Professionals, politicians, and businessmen got together to discuss strategies for their individual communities and it grew into something more. Dr. Eric Miller lead surgeon at Oregon Health & Science Universitys medical center, an enhanced mortal, is elected chairman of the Guild. His rise to power and success is attributed to the organization of neighborhood watches and information trade routes for mundane and supernatural information. Though rumors were whispered for years after that wizards might have played a roll. This was never investigated.%25%25%0a> *%25mage%251955 - Blitz and a small crew, sent to investigate near the coast, go missing.

The status of Lady Alexandria after the raid is unknown. %25vampire%25In response to the unacceptably violent werewolf attack, The Prince declares war on the Werewolves, thus beginning The Vampire-Wolf War. %25changeling%25The Vampire-Wolf War is ongoing and while the freehold maintains its strict secrecy, some motleys start acting as mercenaries. Several vampires, and wolves die mysteriously in their sleep.%25%25 War breaks out between the Vampires and Werewolves of Portland.%0a> *%25werewolf%251967 - The Hayes family arrives in Portland from England. Due to their nature as Thrice-Born, they soon joined the war, as they lacked the inherent key weakness most werewolves had: Silver. The Hayes used this nature to start several daytime riots in order to take out known vampire havens. %25vampire%25By this point, several known Kindred powerhouses have been found slain in their fortified Havens. Investigation by the Seeker reveals little other than they were slain without a battle.%25%25%0a> *%25mage%251968 - Though the Consilium had grown small in active membership, Dante and Provost Shiver choose to act to prevent the fighting from breaking into the mortal world. Two emissaries are sent to the warring factions to negotiate a cease fire - Thyrsus Fortuna is sent to the Wolves, and Moros Shatter is sent to the Vampires. The emissaries are returned in body bags though details of their fate are unclear. This is considered a declaration of war. Dante? personally seeks out each mage still known to the Consilium and presents two options: fight or die. %25changeling%25The wolves begin hiring a motley of Walker Courtiers to take them through the Trods of the Hedge to get past mage wards and vampiric defenses. %25%25%0a> *%25changeling%251969 - It becomes widely known that there is a fourth faction involved in the war, and the freehold is thrown into turmoil as their secrecy is shattered. %25mortal%25War of the Four Factions officially named. %25vampire%25The City officially opens Elysium as a safe ground for Kindred with no haven of their own to retreat to.%25%25%0a> *%25mortal%251970s: Pressure from ranking members of the Rose City Guild forces Dr. Miller steps down as Rose City guild chairman elect to make way for his daughter Jennie Lewis.  Jennie is a master strategist and opportunist that was able to advance her status through nepotism and by organizing the creation several chapters of the guild led by her loyal companions. %0a> %0a> **The War of the Four was starting to heat up at the time, and the effects were starting to be felt by the mortal population. In the face of the ongoing shadow war, the Rose City Guild did its best to help humanity. They organized into formalized chapters, began to cautiously study the supernatural world around them, and learn how it affected their mundane lives. %0a> %0a> **Through the 70s people became more open to Parapsychology- psychic powers - and the Rose City Guild was successful at finding and recruiting some of these people to help them keep humanity safe as the shadow war burned through the city. Jennie Lewis voiced often that Detection, Identification, and Protection were key for the Guild. %0a> %0a> **Members of the guild were spread throughout Portlands society- doctors, lawyers politicians, entertainers, even members of the unions who fought against the corrupt practices of the past. Doctors and the police watched for signs of humans falling prey to the vampires or werewolves while politicians watched for their colleagues making sudden uncharacteristic swings of opinion that could be indicative of a mage or vampires mental influence. Some of the psychics spoke of Changelings crawling through their dreams. The union members, teachers, and even criminals started coming together when word of trouble came, and places where mortals died found themselves under intense scrutiny so it would not happen again. %0a> *%25changeling%251970 - Counterattacks are launched against the freehold and the Three Pillar Crown changes hands as Gristle seizes power once more and begins to reign in the more independent elements of the Courts. %25vampire%25Elysium is raided by a Werewolf pack. For the first time, Elysium falls to an outside force, and the City sees the loss of its beloved Prince as he ensures the death of said raiding party, to a man. The Primogen spend a month in seclusion in order to decide who should be appointed Prince. When they emerge, missing the Carthian Elder, Revered Comstock is anointed as the Sanctified Prince of the City. After a short investigation, the previous Keepers of Elysium are executed for heresy and treason. When the request goes out, only the Circle responds. Within a season, the Circle-provided Keeper of Elysium, Chanda, proves herself and her cult up to the task of defending Elysium, as it is assaulted 3 separate times by Werewolf packs. Each time, all traces of the attacks on Elysium disappear within the day.%25%25%0a> *%25changeling%251971 - An alliance is made with the Werewolves. In a desperate attempt to regain their shattered peace, the Wolves are sealed to a pledge that they will guard the Freehold from the reprisals of other factions and never ask for assassinations within dreams to happen again. The freehold offered guides through the hedge for those who dared those paths, healing, and physical fighters.%25%25%0a> *%25vampire%251972 - The Lancean Elder falls in an ill-advised assault on the Consilium, resulting in many crusaders finding True Death at the hands of the Magi. Lancean leadership falls to Father Fontaine.%25%25%0a> *%25vampire%251973 - The Ordo Dracul provides intel from captured Changelings regarding the location, and methods to access, the Freehold. The Lancea Sanctum, after its own investigation using other captives, confirms the information. Plans are drafted to leak the information to the mages. Several neonates die before the plan sees success.%25%25%0a> *%25mortal%251975: Rose City Livery is founded as an underground railroad of sorts for the Mortal+ population to evade the battles during the War of the 4. Long after the war RC Livery has carried on and expanded their services to members of the guild and potential members of the guild. Often they are both the first line of defense and last for newly empowered mortals.%25%25%0a> *%25changeling%251974 - The alliance is quite successful but some of the packs did not think the freehold was doing as much as they could to finish the war and arranged- or simply let happen- a mage sortie against the freehold in hopes that it would push the freehold into further action. The attack was devastating, and the Gristle Queen perished in the assault. %25mage%25Provost Shiver loses her life during the raid, while Dante sees Pandemonium again. %25vampire%25With the pledge broken, Indira and Constantine institute the first of several two-pronged, savage assaults on the territory of several werewolf packs, leaving the savaged remains of the pack members where they fell.%25%25%0a> *%25changeling%251975 - The Freehold refused alliances after the previous betrayal and under the new Gristle King, took a purely defensive stance while spearheading efforts to bring the other factions to sit down for peace talks. Meanwhile the freehold begins to focus on gathering information, power, and influence in the mortal world.%25%25%0a> *%25vampire%251979 - The Crone Elder passes under a presumed Mage assault on her haven. Shortly thereafter, the representatives of the Vampires finally show up to the peace talks.%25%25%0a> *%25changeling%251980 - The Court of Gristles efforts finally come to fruition as elders from all four factions come together and found the Embassy. The Changeling delegation Seals the agreements being made at the negotiation table, binding everyone to ensure that everyone was acting in good faith. %25%25%0a> **%25mortal%25The War reaches a conclusion with the founding of the Embassy to negotiate peace and forge an alliance between the remaining members of all four factions and introducing a fifth faction - Mortals possessing supernatural abilities or who had come to Know. %25%25%0a> **%25vampire%25With the losses at hand, no Covenants have the numbers to put forth a reliable candidate for Primogen. This leaves Constantine as the sole Primogen. %25%25%0a> **%25white%25War of the Four Ended UN Formed. %25%25%0a> **%25werewolf%25While the Alpha pack supported the embassy, the families stopped overly interacting with each other. The Zhang family supported the Embassy, the Dambrosio family was against the embassy, and the Hayes family became insular and only focused on helping Forsaken as best they could.%25%25%0a> **%25mortal%25An enhanced woman known as Ms. Natasha (Fae Touched) translated the call to peace hidden on a billboard to Dr. Miller.  The Embassy was founded and the Rose City Guild sent Dr. Miller and Ms. Lewis to represent the the city and guild. They forced their way into a seat at the table- much to the consternation of the other factions. This was accomplished through their bizarre gifts and the Guilds goal of Identification- they brought with them an entire binder full of names, pseudonyms, and photos of almost every single member of the newly formed Embassy. Knowledge, not petty supernatural tricks, was the power that carried the day for them.%25%25%0a> *%25mortal%251985 - Nutraceutical craze hits off as a holistic alternative to modern medicine. Californian Resident Antony Mores  (wife dies to cancer) inherits majority ownership to the multi-million Pharmaceutical Fortune.%25%25%0a> **%25mortal%25Mores Pharmaceutical closes in January%25%25%0a> **%25mortal%25In September Aion Nutraceuticals opens in California.%25%25%0a> **%25mortal%25Jennie Lewis takes over for her father as leader of the Rose City Guild as it was discovered she had a structured mind that advances the goals of the Rose City Guild.

Aion Nutraceuticals opens in September. %25%25%0a> *%25vampire%25Early 1990s - As the internet age booms, the City sees a resurgence of Carthian membership, though their leadership changes often, sometimes as often as monthly.%25%25%0a> *%25changeling%251991 - Portland grows and mortal political protests earn the city the nickname Little Beirut. The Court of Beirut is born out of the political atmosphere of the time in violent reaction the Gristle Courts long term dominance. The Court of Three Pillars has four active courts.%25%25%0a> *%25changeling%251992 - Huntsmen attacks begin happening more frequently, and True Fae are sighted riding in the streets. Courtiers are taken back to Arcadia, and many flee the area entirely. The Court of Walkers is the first to collapse under the pressure, with three courts remaining, the True Fae sightings abruptly cease while the Huntsmen attacks taper off to usual levels.%25%25%0a> *Late 1990s - Dotcom bubble bursts, %25vampire%25causing certain resources of the City to take a hit as many investments fall through.%25%25%0a> *%25mage%251994 - 1997 Pentacle and Seer war with the banishers. In the early 1990s Several staggered tactical strikes against the Pentacle mages of Portland left the consilum in ruin. Each order was hit and took heavy losses. The Seers gain majority control over Portlands supernal landscape. While Banishers focus their attacks on the Pentacle until their resistance is almost nill. The Banishers turn their attention to the Seers in a  blitzkrieg that nearly wiped them out. Pushed back against the wall the Pentacle and the Seers realized the wall was each other. Uniting their forces they are able to push the banishers out of the city. %25%25%0a> *%25werewolf%251996 - Major Lulaya attack threatens the Forsaken and the Embassy, Samantha Armsden father, Corrin Armsden, was killed in battle against this.

The decision wasnt popular with many of the magi on a personal level, but Dante? used the alliance to grow the numbers of Supernal allies that never really replenished in the decade after the war. Additionally, where Seers had stepped into positions of power throughout the city, the alliance offered the Pentacle magi a peaceful in road to take over those positions. And of course the adage holds true, keep your enemies closer - the alliance additionally offered a passive protection from the Seers to keep them from outright destroying the Pentacle and a more active alliance versus their mutual enemy: the Banishers. But change takes time and this alliance is still viewed with caution today.%25%25%0a> *%25mortal%251998 - Mores makes huge changes to Aion Nutraceuticals due to California Wild Fires damaging a AN warehouse. Mores 4th wife dies in fire. Aion Nutraceuticals primary Lab and Corporate Headquarters move north to Portland Oregon.%25%25%0a> *%25mage%252000 The Seer Pentacle alliance fostered peace and allowed the Pentacle to take positions of power throughout the city. Some magi in the consili are know to site a familiar adage as it holds true, keep your enemies closer. The alliance additionally offered a passive protection from the Seers to keep them from outright destroying the Pentacle and a more active alliance versus their mutual enemy: the Banishers. But change takes time and this alliance is still viewed with caution today. %25%25%0a> *%25mortal%252004 The aging Dr. Lewis was accidentally murdered by a deranged changeling that lost control of themselves in a medical dreaming session.

Unity won the day. Many magi, but still not all, began to accept the alliance over the years to follow. But a question lingers why are the Banishers targeting Portland?%25%25%0a> *%25mortal%252007 - The Mores Wing of Aion Nutraceuticals Lab is opened 100s of new STEM based jobs are available in Portland. Team Mores moves to the exclusive state-of-the-art Mores Wing while Team Nakamura moves to the previously held wing of Team Mores. %25%25%0a> *%25mortal%252008 Jennie appoints a new ally to the Rose City Livery Service.

Some tell tales of war with the werewolves, or magi, or Strix being the cause of their flight, others stranger things. Even stranger, many query their fellow Kindred on the fate of other survivors, ones they claim fled to Portland before their own flight, yet not one seems to be found in the lists of those presented to the city.%25%25%0a> %0a> **%25changeling%25Current: Since the War of the Four ended and the Three Pillar Freehold was established with Gristle, Beirut, and the Forteans, Portland has been a relative oasis of calm. While internal politics can get messy at times, the Huntsmen have been kept at relative bay and its been long enough that most of the younger generation of Lost dont even remember the War. Things are getting dangerous outside the Pacific Northwest though. Contacts in far off cities report tensions running high and attacks from disparate sources. Miami is no longer properly recognizing the shift of Seasons, Toronto suffered a revolution and executed an entire Court, and Detroit was driven from the city entirely. Changelings with strange Mantles are on the move with new stories and ideas, and desperate to find a place that they can fit into to find a new home. Loyalists are on the rise too- infiltrating the refugees, and Portland has seen its fair share of those in recent years. The Embassy has given the Freehold a stronger measure of security than most, and the Lost who hear of it are coming.%25%25%0a

Some tell tales of war with the werewolves, or magi, or Strix being the cause of their flight, others stranger things. Even stranger, many query their fellow Kindred on the fate of other survivors, ones they claim fled to Portland before their own flight, yet not one seems to be found in the lists of those presented to the city.%25%25%0a%3c %0a%3c **%25changeling%25Current: Since the War of the Four ended and the Three Pillar Freehold was established with Gristle, Beirut, and the Forteans, Portland has been a relative oasis of calm. While internal politics can get messy at times, the Huntsmen have been kept at relative bay and its been long enough that most of the younger generation of Lost dont even remember the War. Things are getting dangerous outside the Pacific Northwest though. Contacts in far off cities report tensions running high and attacks from disparate sources. Miami is no longer properly recognizing the shift of Seasons, Toronto suffered a revolution and executed an entire Court, and Detroit was driven from the city entirely. Changelings with strange Mantles are on the move with new stories and ideas, and desperate to find a place that they can fit into to find a new home. Loyalists are on the rise too- infiltrating the refugees, and Portland has seen its fair share of those in recent years. The Embassy has given the Freehold a stronger measure of security than most, and the Lost who hear of it are coming.%25%25%0a---%0a> *1970 - Counterattacks are launched against the freehold and the Three Pillar Crown changes hands as Gristle seizes power once more and begins to reign in the more independent elements of the Courts. Elysium is raided by a Werewolf pack. For the first time, Elysium falls to an outside force, and the City sees the loss of its beloved Prince as he ensures the death of said raiding party, to a man. The Primogen spend a month in seclusion in order to decide who should be appointed Prince. When they emerge, missing the Carthian Elder, Revered Comstock is anointed as the Sanctified Prince of the City. After a short investigation, the previous Keepers of Elysium are executed for heresy and treason. When the request goes out, only the Circle responds. Within a season, the Circle-provided Keeper of Elysium, Chanda, proves herself and her cult up to the task of defending Elysium, as it is assaulted 3 separate times by Werewolf packs. Each time, all traces of the attacks on Elysium disappear within the day.%0a> *1971 - An alliance is made with the Werewolves. In a desperate attempt to regain their shattered peace, the Wolves are sealed to a pledge that they will guard the Freehold from the reprisals of other factions and never ask for assassinations within dreams to happen again. The freehold offered guides through the hedge for those who dared those paths, healing, and physical fighters.%0a> *1972 - The Lancean Elder falls in an ill-advised assault on the Consilium, resulting in many crusaders finding True Death at the hands of the Magi. Lancean leadership falls to Father Fontaine.%0a> *1973 - The Ordo Dracul provides intel from captured Changelings regarding the location, and methods to access, the Freehold. The Lancea Sanctum, after its own investigation using other captives, confirms the information. Plans are drafted to leak the information to the mages. Several neonates die before the plan sees success.%0a> *1975: Rose City Livery is founded as an underground railroad of sorts for the Mortal+ population to evade the battles during the War of the 4. Long after the war RC Livery has carried on and expanded their services to members of the guild and potential members of the guild. Often they are both the first line of defense and last for newly empowered mortals.%0a> *1974 - The alliance is quite successful but some of the packs did not think the freehold was doing as much as they could to finish the war and arranged- or simply let happen- a mage sortie against the freehold in hopes that it would push the freehold into further action. The attack was devastating, and the Gristle Queen perished in the assault. Provost Shiver loses her life during the raid, while Dante sees Pandemonium again. With the pledge broken, Indira and Constantine institute the first of several two-pronged, savage assaults on the territory of several werewolf packs, leaving the savaged remains of the pack members where they fell.%0a> *1975 - The Freehold refused alliances after the previous betrayal and under the new Gristle King, took a purely defensive stance while spearheading efforts to bring the other factions to sit down for peace talks. Meanwhile the freehold begins to focus on gathering information, power, and influence in the mortal world%0a> *1979 - The Crone Elder passes under a presumed Mage assault on her haven. Shortly thereafter, the representatives of the Vampires finally show up to the peace talks.%0a> *1980 - The Court of Gristles efforts finally come to fruition as elders from all four factions come together and found the Embassy. The Changeling delegation Seals the agreements being made at the negotiation table, binding everyone to ensure that everyone was acting in good faith. %0a> **The War reaches a conclusion with the founding of the Embassy to negotiate peace and forge an alliance between the remaining members of all four factions and introducing a fifth faction - Mortals possessing supernatural abilities or who had come to Know. %0a> **With the losses at hand, no Covenants have the numbers to put forth a reliable candidate for Primogen. This leaves Constantine as the sole Primogen. %0a> **War of the Four Ended UN Formed. %0a> **While the Alpha pack supported the embassy, the families stopped overly interacting with each other. The Zhang family supported the Embassy, the Dambrosio family was against the embassy, and the Hayes family became insular and only focused on helping Forsaken as best they could.%0a> **An enhanced woman known as Ms. Natasha (Fae Touched) translated the call to peace hidden on a billboard to Dr. Miller.  The Embassy was founded and the Rose City Guild sent Dr. Miller and Ms. Lewis to represent the the city and guild. They forced their way into a seat at the table- much to the consternation of the other factions. This was accomplished through their bizarre gifts and the Guilds goal of Identification- they brought with them an entire binder full of names, pseudonyms, and photos of almost every single member of the newly formed Embassy. Knowledge, not petty supernatural tricks, was the power that carried the day for them.%0a> %0a> *1985 - Nutraceutical craze hits off as a holistic alternative to modern medicine.

Simon Benson donates money to install 4-bowl drinking fountains downtown.%0a82,88c66%0a%3c *1920 - Zhang family arrives in Portland, bringing with it the opium trade that had been banned in Portland.%0a%3c *1922 - The Carthian instituted election for the Citys Prince is won by an Invictus. The Prince then abolishes the annual election in favor of a more traditional system, where Covenant appointed Elders serve as Primogen to the ruling Prince.%0a%3c *1923 - The Prince abolishes most of the Carthian-created positions, keeping only the Seeker and Advocate roles. Re-establishes the more traditional Seneschal position to manage the day-to-day business of the City, as well as the Keepers of Elysium.%0a%3c *1935 - The Court of Discovery hangs by a thread until works of Charles Fort make their way to Portland and inspire the Court to change again, becoming the Court of Forteans. Their numbers grow slightly, but they remain small compared to the dominant Gristle and the Walkers.%0a%3c *1938 - The Hierarch, [[Kit]], is killed during a battle against Banishers. [[Dante]] is named the new Hierarch.Under his leadership, subsequent Banisher attacks in the following years were suppressed and ultimately vanquished.%0a%3c *1940 - Dante appoints Blitz to the position of Adamant Sage and charges him to explore the tunnels. Nothing is discovered and the explorations are ended.%0a%3c *1941 - Kaiser Shipyards get Liberty ship contract. This ultimately contributes towards a major first movement in civil rights on the west coast as women and non-white races are hired to complete contracts. (Free Council takes a major part in this.) As the US goes to war again, some in the freehold avoid service while others go willingly. The freehold itself adopts a policy of extreme secrecy in order to protect those who refuse to answer the draft. They withdraw from mortal and supernatural affairs almost entirely, and become more of a myth than a known faction of supernaturals in Portland.%0a---%0a> *1941 - Kaiser Shipyards get Liberty ship contract%0a90,152c68%0a%3c *late 1950s the Rose City Guild formalized into a recognisable entity that moves pieces of the city from the shadow. Professionals, politicians, and businessmen got together to discuss strategies for their individual communities and it grew into something more. Dr. Eric Miller lead surgeon at Oregon Health & Science Universitys medical center, an enhanced mortal, is elected chairman of the Guild. His rise to power and success is attributed to the organization of neighborhood watches and information trade routes for mundane and supernatural information. Though rumors were whispered for years after that wizards might have played a roll. This was never investigated.%0a%3c *1955 - Blitz? and a small crew, sent to investigate near the coast, go missing. The Consiliums investigations find no evidence of a storm that may have washed the missing mages away, and attempts to scry their last known location prove ineffective.%0a%3c *1955 - Dante? pushes to send more magi to investigate the coast, but his plans are interrupted as the Seers set up a Pylon in Portland, opening Sans Occult Shop. The shop was inaccurately connected to the deaths of two teenagers and subsequently burned to the ground by locals. The Zheng Family arrives in Portland, and begins to pave the way for the Triad to start taking control of the criminal underworld.%0a%3c *1960 - The Free Council is welcomed into the Portland Consilium with the agreement to stand against Banishers and Seers. Both enemies are run out of the city.%0a%3c *1965 - Lady Alexandria DAmbrosio is set to take over as the head of the family when she First Change. Unfortunately, she falls in love with a vampire, who after a long courtship embraces her, sealing their eternal love and devotion with an Oath of Matrimony. The DAmbrosio family refuses to accept this, instead hunting down the vampire and causing the true death of both the vampire, and that vampires entire coterie. The status of Lady Alexandria after the raid is unknown. In response to the unacceptably violent werewolf attack, The Prince declares war on the Werewolves, thus beginning The Vampire-Wolf War. The Vampire-Wolf War is ongoing and while the freehold maintains its strict secrecy, some motleys start acting as mercenaries. Several vampires, and wolves die mysteriously in their sleep. War breaks out between the Vampires and Werewolves of Portland.%0a%3c *1967 - The Hayes family arrives in Portland from England. Due to their nature as Thrice-Born, they soon joined the war, as they lacked the inherent key weakness most werewolves had: Silver. The Hayes used this nature to start several daytime riots in order to take out known vampire havens. By this point, several known Kindred powerhouses have been found slain in their fortified Havens. Investigation by the Seeker reveals little other than they were slain without a battle.%0a%3c *1968 - Though the Consilium had grown small in active membership, Dante and Provost Shiver choose to act to prevent the fighting from breaking into the mortal world. Two emissaries are sent to the warring factions to negotiate a cease fire - Thyrsus Fortuna is sent to the Wolves, and Moros Shatter is sent to the Vampires. The emissaries are returned in body bags though details of their fate are unclear. This is considered a declaration of war. Dante? personally seeks out each mage still known to the Consilium and presents two options: fight or die. The wolves begin hiring a motley of Walker Courtiers to take them through the Trods of the Hedge to get past mage wards and vampiric defenses. %0a%3c *1969 - It becomes widely known that there is a fourth faction involved in the war, and the freehold is thrown into turmoil as their secrecy is shattered. War of the Four Factions officially named. The City officially opens Elysium as a safe ground for Kindred with no haven of their own to retreat to.%0a%3c *1970s: Pressure from ranking members of the Rose City Guild forces Dr. Miller steps down as Rose City guild chairman elect to make way for his daughter Jennie Lewis.  Jennie is a master strategist and opportunist that was able to advance her status through nepotism and by organizing the creation several chapters of the guild led by her loyal companions. %0a%3c %0a%3c **The War of the Four was starting to heat up at the time, and the effects were starting to be felt by the mortal population. In the face of the ongoing shadow war, the Rose City Guild did its best to help humanity. They organized into formalized chapters, began to cautiously study the supernatural world around them, and learn how it affected their mundane lives. %0a%3c %0a%3c **Through the 70s people became more open to Parapsychology- psychic powers - and the Rose City Guild was successful at finding and recruiting some of these people to help them keep humanity safe as the shadow war burned through the city. Jennie Lewis voiced often that Detection, Identification, and Protection were key for the Guild. %0a%3c %0a%3c **Members of the guild were spread throughout Portlands society- doctors, lawyers politicians, entertainers, even members of the unions who fought against the corrupt practices of the past. Doctors and the police watched for signs of humans falling prey to the vampires or werewolves while politicians watched for their colleagues making sudden uncharacteristic swings of opinion that could be indicative of a mage or vampires mental influence. Some of the psychics spoke of Changelings crawling through their dreams. The union members, teachers, and even criminals started coming together when word of trouble came, and places where mortals died found themselves under intense scrutiny so it would not happen again. %0a%3c *1970 - Counterattacks are launched against the freehold and the Three Pillar Crown changes hands as Gristle seizes power once more and begins to reign in the more independent elements of the Courts. Elysium is raided by a Werewolf pack. For the first time, Elysium falls to an outside force, and the City sees the loss of its beloved Prince as he ensures the death of said raiding party, to a man. The Primogen spend a month in seclusion in order to decide who should be appointed Prince. When they emerge, missing the Carthian Elder, Revered Comstock is anointed as the Sanctified Prince of the City. After a short investigation, the previous Keepers of Elysium are executed for heresy and treason. When the request goes out, only the Circle responds. Within a season, the Circle-provided Keeper of Elysium, Chanda, proves herself and her cult up to the task of defending Elysium, as it is assaulted 3 separate times by Werewolf packs. Each time, all traces of the attacks on Elysium disappear within the day.%0a%3c *1971 - An alliance is made with the Werewolves. In a desperate attempt to regain their shattered peace, the Wolves are sealed to a pledge that they will guard the Freehold from the reprisals of other factions and never ask for assassinations within dreams to happen again. The freehold offered guides through the hedge for those who dared those paths, healing, and physical fighters.%0a%3c *1972 - The Lancean Elder falls in an ill-advised assault on the Consilium, resulting in many crusaders finding True Death at the hands of the Magi. Lancean leadership falls to Father Fontaine.%0a%3c *1973 - The Ordo Dracul provides intel from captured Changelings regarding the location, and methods to access, the Freehold. The Lancea Sanctum, after its own investigation using other captives, confirms the information. Plans are drafted to leak the information to the mages. Several neonates die before the plan sees success.%0a%3c *1975: Rose City Livery is founded as an underground railroad of sorts for the Mortal+ population to evade the battles during the War of the 4. Long after the war RC Livery has carried on and expanded their services to members of the guild and potential members of the guild. Often they are both the first line of defense and last for newly empowered mortals.%0a%3c *1974 - The alliance is quite successful but some of the packs did not think the freehold was doing as much as they could to finish the war and arranged- or simply let happen- a mage sortie against the freehold in hopes that it would push the freehold into further action. The attack was devastating, and the Gristle Queen perished in the assault. Provost Shiver loses her life during the raid, while Dante sees Pandemonium again. With the pledge broken, Indira and Constantine institute the first of several two-pronged, savage assaults on the territory of several werewolf packs, leaving the savaged remains of the pack members where they fell.%0a%3c *1975 - The Freehold refused alliances after the previous betrayal and under the new Gristle King, took a purely defensive stance while spearheading efforts to bring the other factions to sit down for peace talks. Meanwhile the freehold begins to focus on gathering information, power, and influence in the mortal world%0a%3c *1979 - The Crone Elder passes under a presumed Mage assault on her haven. Shortly thereafter, the representatives of the Vampires finally show up to the peace talks.%0a%3c *1980 - The Court of Gristles efforts finally come to fruition as elders from all four factions come together and found the Embassy. The Changeling delegation Seals the agreements being made at the negotiation table, binding everyone to ensure that everyone was acting in good faith. %0a%3c **The War reaches a conclusion with the founding of the Embassy to negotiate peace and forge an alliance between the remaining members of all four factions and introducing a fifth faction - Mortals possessing supernatural abilities or who had come to Know. %0a%3c **With the losses at hand, no Covenants have the numbers to put forth a reliable candidate for Primogen. This leaves Constantine as the sole Primogen. %0a%3c **War of the Four Ended UN Formed. %0a%3c **While the Alpha pack supported the embassy, the families stopped overly interacting with each other. The Zhang family supported the Embassy, the Dambrosio family was against the embassy, and the Hayes family became insular and only focused on helping Forsaken as best they could.%0a%3c **An enhanced woman known as Ms. Natasha (Fae Touched) translated the call to peace hidden on a billboard to Dr. Miller.  The Embassy was founded and the Rose City Guild sent Dr. Miller and Ms. Lewis to represent the the city and guild. They forced their way into a seat at the table- much to the consternation of the other factions. This was accomplished through their bizarre gifts and the Guilds goal of Identification- they brought with them an entire binder full of names, pseudonyms, and photos of almost every single member of the newly formed Embassy. Knowledge, not petty supernatural tricks, was the power that carried the day for them.%0a%3c %0a%3c *1985 - Nutraceutical craze hits off as a holistic alternative to modern medicine. Californian Resident Antony Mores  (wife dies to cancer) inherits majority ownership to the multi-million Pharmaceutical Fortune.%0a%3c **Mores Pharmaceutical closes in January%0a%3c **In September Aion Nutraceuticals opens in California.%0a%3c **Jennie Lewis takes over for her father as leader of the Rose City Guild as it was discovered she had a structured mind that advances the goals of the Rose City Guild. Rose City Health, Wellness, and Sleep Center opens near OHSUs medical epicenter. %0a%3c *1987 Mores Pharmaceuticals closes January. Aion Nutraceuticals opens in September. %0a%3c *Early 1990s - As the internet age booms, the City sees a resurgence of Carthian membership, though their leadership changes often, sometimes as often as monthly.%0a%3c *1991 - Portland grows and mortal political protests earn the city the nickname Little Beirut. The Court of Beirut is born out of the political atmosphere of the time in violent reaction the Gristle Courts long term dominance. The Court of Three Pillars has four active courts.%0a%3c *1992 - Huntsmen attacks begin happening more frequently, and True Fae are sighted riding in the streets. Courtiers are taken back to Arcadia, and many flee the area entirely. The Court of Walkers is the first to collapse under the pressure, with three courts remaining, the True Fae sightings abruptly cease while the Huntsmen attacks taper off to usual levels.%0a%3c *Late 1990s - Dotcom bubble bursts, causing certain resources of the City to take a hit as many investments fall through.%0a%3c *1994 - 1997 Pentacle and Seer war with the banishers. In the early 1990s Several staggered tactical strikes against the Pentacle mages of Portland left the consilum in ruin. Each order was hit and took heavy losses. The Seers gain majority control over Portlands supernal landscape. While Banishers focus their attacks on the Pentacle until their resistance is almost nill. The Banishers turn their attention to the Seers in a  blitzkrieg that nearly wiped them out. Pushed back against the wall the Pentacle and the Seers realized the wall was each other. Uniting their forces they are able to push the banishers out of the city. %0a%3c *1996 - Major Lulaya attack threatens the Forsaken and the Embassy, Samantha Armsden father, Corrin Armsden, was killed in battle against this. Sam takes her fathers place as alpha in the pack and helps decimate the Lulaya.%0a%3c Diamond Security is a private security firm created during the Mage/Seer/Banisher war by the the Adamantine Arrow and strongly supported by the Consilia.%0a%3c *1997 - The Lex is rewritten to make an alliance with the Seers of the Throne. The decision wasnt popular with many of the magi on a personal level, but Dante? used the alliance to grow the numbers of Supernal allies that never really replenished in the decade after the war. Additionally, where Seers had stepped into positions of power throughout the city, the alliance offered the Pentacle magi a peaceful in road to take over those positions. And of course the adage holds true, keep your enemies closer - the alliance additionally offered a passive protection from the Seers to keep them from outright destroying the Pentacle and a more active alliance versus their mutual enemy: the Banishers. But change takes time and this alliance is still viewed with caution today.%0a%3c *1998 - Mores makes huge changes to Aion Nutraceuticals due to California Wild Fires damaging a AN warehouse. Mores 4th wife dies in fire. Aion Nutraceuticals primary Lab and Corporate Headquarters move north to Portland Oregon.%0a%3c *2000 The Seer Pentacle alliance fostered peace and allowed the Pentacle to take positions of power throughout the city. Some magi in the consili are know to site a familiar adage as it holds true, keep your enemies closer. The alliance additionally offered a passive protection from the Seers to keep them from outright destroying the Pentacle and a more active alliance versus their mutual enemy: the Banishers. But change takes time and this alliance is still viewed with caution today. %0a%3c *2004 The aging Dr. Lewis was accidentally murdered by a deranged changeling that lost control of themselves in a medical dreaming session. Public knowledge, Dr. Lewis, died of old age in his sleep.%0a%3c *2004-2007 - Dr. James St. Patrick and Ankita Nakamura join Aion Nutraceuticals. Dr. James St. Patrick takes family name of Mores. Aion Nutraceuticals announces several new Research and Development Teams to advance Nutraceutical Technology.Team Mores moves to the exclusive state-of-the-art Mores Wing Funded by the Rose City Guild under dummy corporations. While Team Nakamura moves to the previously held wing of Team Mores.%0a%3c *2005 -Samantha Armsden becomes head Alpha of Portland.%0a%3c *2006 - In a bold turn of events during the summer of 2006 a massive  Banisher raid on Portland pushed against the unified Pentacle Seer alliance. Unity won the day. Many magi, but still not all, began to accept the alliance over the years to follow. But a question lingers why are the Banishers targeting Portland?%0a%3c *2007 - The Mores Wing of Aion Nutraceuticals Lab is opened 100s of new STEM based jobs are available in Portland. Team Mores moves to the exclusive state-of-the-art Mores Wing while Team Nakamura moves to the previously held wing of Team Mores. %0a%3c *2008 Jennie appoints a new ally to the Rose City Livery Service. George Evans blindly follows the woman with a devotion that mirrors hero worship.%0a%3c *2010 - Jennie Lewis appoints Dr. Francine Martin to the Rose City Health, Wellness, and Sleep Center though Francine is secretly vitae addicted. James Mores is elected assistant to the Rose City Ambassador. Aion Nutraceuticals offers local college students exclusive paid internships for Aion Nutro.%0a%3c *2012 - Aion Nutro surprisingly squashes an attempted hostile corporate takeover by Green America (another Nutraceutical Company) that would oust Antony Mores from Aion Nutro.%0a%3c *2012 - 2015 Aion Nutro is bombarded with legal battles from competitor Green America. Resulting in the US Government seizing Green America and having its CEO arrested and convicted. Green America CEO is currently serving 20 years in prison. %0a%3c *2013 - Aion Nutro stocks skyrocket with the release of a natural supplement that quickly and greatly reduces joint pain and inflammation. %0a%3c **Free Council opens a Support Center called Alphabet Soup for the Soul %0a%3c *2014 - Green America sues Aion Nutro for product theft. The case is dropped when proof of falsified clinical research and formulas is brought to light. CEO of Green Earth is arrested and sent to jail and Green America is seized by the US Government. Green America CEO is serving 20 years in prison.%0a%3c *2015- A Free Council Dummy Corporation buys out the Failing Green America and renames it Green Market America. Head quarters found in Silicion Forest.%0a%3c *2016 - Current Without direct competition for 6 consecutive quarters Aion Nutro stocks continue to climb and Aion **Nutro is poised to take the International stage.%0a%3c **Current - War has continued beyond the influence of the City, but only in the past few years have the stories trickled in with the survivors and refugees. Some tell tales of war with the werewolves, or magi, or Strix being the cause of their flight, others stranger things. Even stranger, many query their fellow Kindred on the fate of other survivors, ones they claim fled to Portland before their own flight, yet not one seems to be found in the lists of those presented to the city.%0a%3c %0a%3c **Current: Since the War of the Four ended and the Three Pillar Freehold was established with Gristle, Beirut, and the Forteans, Portland has been a relative oasis of calm. While internal politics can get messy at times, the Huntsmen have been kept at relative bay and its been long enough that most of the younger generation of Lost dont even remember the War. Things are getting dangerous outside the Pacific Northwest though. Contacts in far off cities report tensions running high and attacks from disparate sources. Miami is no longer properly recognizing the shift of Seasons, Toronto suffered a revolution and executed an entire Court, and Detroit was driven from the city entirely. Changelings with strange Mantles are on the move with new stories and ideas, and desperate to find a place that they can fit into to find a new home. Loyalists are on the rise too- infiltrating the refugees, and Portland has seen its fair share of those in recent years. The Embassy has given the Freehold a stronger measure of security than most, and the Lost who hear of it are coming.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> *Late 1990s - Dotcom bubble bursts%0a

What a beautiful city: sprawling landscape, eclectic culture, grand scale acceptance of all walks of life. This is the perfect city, almost.%0a%3c %0a%3c Its crowded enough to meet new people daily, yet spread out enough to that you arent bumping shoulders with everyone you walk past. The food is great, the sightseeing is top notch, and as I said, its a perfect city almost. That is what you would believe if you didnt know what has happened behind the veil. A war between the factions raged; its influence rippling out across the supernatural landscape.%0a%3c %0a%3c You lost We all Lost. So many%0a%3c %0a%3c THE War. The War of the Four, as its known by many in the city, was devastating to the Pacific Northwest. Because of the War we had to make a change. We lost too many Elders, Masters, Court Leaders, and Alphas to continue the old ways. Our alliance, the Embassy created by the few that survived, a Supernatural UN if you will, has worked to defend the city and to secure our future. Had we not we would be on the same path as all the other strongholds. Under the Embassys influence the wolves fight alongside the mages, the vampires work with the empowered mortals, to survive we must.%0a%3c %0a%3c But this doesnt mean that we had to change everything. The secrets remain, the veils still stands, the masquerade still shield the mortals from us. We all work together, the Court of Metal was created by the Freehold as a defense response, artifice needed to masterfully create tools for all of us to defend our homes, our neighborhoods, our territories. The Thrice-Born and Forsaken haunt the shadow watching for our enemies to slip up. We all help with the city, and even the Seers have allied with the Consilium for survival.%0a%3c %0a%3c If one of us falls, we all fall.%0a%3c %0a%3c Though the War of the Four concluded decades ago - elsewhere conflict continues to flourish between the various factions across North America. The battles have had a devastating toll on the populations of many of the major cities. New York City, not a Kindred in sight. Chicago, not an Awakened for miles. Dallas, the Forsaken hunted to extinction. Even in Detroit, the Lost have vanished without a trace. Sin Eaters, Demons, even those who possess a Second Sight were hunted down or turned into lab rats. In its wake, Portland has come to be seen by many as the last known sanctuary for all of our kind.%0a%3c %0a%3c Our War is over but outsiders bring battles to our borders. Our enemies attack us directly and indirectly, through our allies in differing Factions. So, for the security of all, we ask for all supernaturals, pro-Embassy or not, to fight. Because there are not enough of us to fight when our enemy comes again. It is calm now, but that will change Refugees from other cities where a Faction has fallen are welcome, but cautiously. Who can be trusted?%0a%3c %0a%3c Overview%0a%3c Portland is a medium sized city, but has gained a national reputation for being Weird.%0a%3c %0a%3c Located in Northern Oregon, and matching its name well (even though that was decided on a game of chance), Portland is a trade depot for the Northwest and the Pacific coast. Portland proper is bisected by the Willamette River which flows to the Columbia River, the border between Washington and Oregon, and from there the Pacific Ocean.%0a%3c %0a%3c Because of its location between mountain ranges and a river, Portland has natural boundaries which have kept it from expanding into an exceptionally large city. The neighborhoods collectively referred to as Downtown are pinched between the West Hills and the Willamette River preventing any further expansion.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c City History%0a%3c Colorized entries indicate the influence of the supernatural (WIP)%0a%3c %0a%3c Before 10,000 BC - First humans pass through area.%0a%3c 1805 - Lewis and Clark pass through area.%0a%3c 1830s - Americans of European descent settle in area in number and many natives wiped out by disease.%0a%3c 1843 - Original land claim is filed by William Overton and Asa Lovejoy%0a%3c 1845 - Naming of Portland.
