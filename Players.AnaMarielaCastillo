Chin held high she walks in a stride suggesting that not only does she know what she wants, she knows exactly how to get it too. Oozing confidence she gives off the aura of an old Cuban ''Duquesa''. Knowing very well that she is a public figure she pays great attention to any detail regarding her outfit and looks and it is unlikely she'd set a foot outside of her own home without taking a second look in the mirror. %0a%0aShe is however not very physically imposing and while she wouldn't bruise from a stiff wind she probably does not frequent the gym for more than some spinning classes. She lacks the powerful musculature of an athlete and stands at no more than 5.4 feet or so. Her eyes reveal a sharp intellect that is quick to pick up social cues, whether they reveal hidden power structures or who is cheating with who behind their spouse's back. She speaks with an accent and while she arrived in the US at a very young age, English is still her second language.%0a%0a%0a!! %25mortal%25 '''+History & Past+'''%0a----%0aDue to Ana Mariela's fame, a lot of her history is more or less public knowledge. Ana Mariela Blanco arrived from Cuba in 1970 as a little girl, making use of the %25newwin%25 [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Flights|Freedom Flights]] with her family. Starting off decently modestly she made a face for herself in the local news as a fifteen-year-old when she, using a portable tape recorder, caught some faculty members of her school, Miami Senior High School, admitting to embezzlement and abusive treatment of fellow staff and students. After the reveal, she was interviewed by a few local newspapers and became fully dedicated to the idealistic goal of improving the world.%0a%0aIn her late teens, she attended Florida International University, studying to become a journalist but dropped out after a year when she met the love of her life, the medical student (and now surgeon) Ernesto Castillo. The two of them got married shortly after finding true love with each other and soon enough Ana Mariela found herself combining the life of a housewife with that of the political activist. With great fervor, she attended, joined and formed a number of NGOs. To list a few, she joined the Red Cross, various church and charity organizations, Cuban culture groups, Cuban study groups, Peace and Democracy for Cuba interest organizations, political committees, neighborhood associations and so on.%0a%0aWith an uncanny ability for organizational work and politicking, she made her way from 'enthusiastic member' to an 'influence for change' through a number of them. As her husband became a successful surgeon and started making a lot of money, she had the resources to organize her own charity drives, or at least be a driving force behind them. She used her resources to protect the interests of her fellow Latin people, in particular, the Cuban exiles. She used her Cuban passport to travel to Cuba to meet with long distant relatives, and carry messages for those who were unable to take the trip themselves (for economical or political reasons). %0a%0aShortly put, she slowly but surely became a pillar of the community. A mother of four, a woman of faith who speaks for 'the little guy' when the big city politicians show up with their schemes and plans.%0a%0a!!! %25mortal%25 Recent History:%0aTragedy struck the Castillo household in early October 2019 when the youngest son of their home, the eighteen-year-old Gabriel Castillo was reported a missing person. He went to visit California for a short vacation but never managed to reach his hotel. The police found nothing and while Ana Mariela employed PIs to continue the search it has been fruitless. After a short break from the public scene, the matriarch of the Castillo family has returned to public life once more with new energy and vigor. %0a%0a!! %25mortal%25 '''+Roleplaying Hooks+'''%0a-----%0a!!!!! %25mortal%25 '''Mamá Ana''' (Exile Cubans, Anyone):%0a%25%25 Even during her teenage years, Ana Mariela tried to improve the world, be it through charity works, community cleanup initiatives or even Neighborhood watch organizations. This spark of idealism didn't fade to embers as she matured, but rather burned even more brightly. These days she is invested in a number of NGOs primarily focusing on Exile Cubans and other members of the Latino community, including drives to help Latinos access higher education, sports grants, support for victims of crime, therapy to beat drug abuse and much, much more.%0aIt is also well known in the community that if you need something in particular and have no one else to turn to, you can always seek Mamá Ana out. She looks out for her own. Your brother went missing? You're having a hard time getting the right permits to open your business? Your father is sick and you cannot afford the bills? Come to Mamá Ana. She helps you out of the good of her heart.%0a%0a!!!!! %25mortal%25 '''Driving-spirit''' (NGO's, Charities, Anyone): %0a%0a%25%25 If there's a drive, charity, grant or fund for it, there's a good chance Ana Mariela has been involved. Keep Miami drug free? Check. Get our teens out of gangs? Check. Study grants for talented youth? Check. Promotion of Cuban culture and heritage? Check. Support groups for returning veterans? Check. Support for children with a parent in prison? Check. Aid for disaster victims? Check. Justice for victims of crime? Check. If there's an organization for it then Ana Mariela is either on the committee, board or in the background, giving advice and her support. It is easy for her to befriend people who are either active in the communities themselves or seeking their aid. While most of her work is at the top these days, she can still be seen from time to time working at the very grassroots level, standing in soup kitchens or changing the bedsheets in local homeless shelters.%0a%0a!!!!! %25mortal%25 '''Champagne and gala dresses''' (High society):%0a%25%25 To some a concert performed in front of the economic and cultural elite of Maimi is a time of entertainment. To many, however, it is also a chance to grease elbows while also establishing your status as a power broker and a 'somebody' in the city. Ana Mariela definitely belongs to the latter and if you've ever attended any event of importance in the last ten years there's a good chance you've at least shook hands and spent some time mingling. If you in any shape or form carry some sort of weight in the community, there's a better chance still that Ana Mariela made sure you met again.%0a%0a!!!!! %25mortal%25 '''Backroom deals and elections''' (Politics):%0a%25%25 Ana Mariela is famous in Miami, especially among its Cuban population, and while not everyone agrees with what she has to say, many people listen when she speaks. Thanks to her extensive network with various NGOs, charities and other organizations it is easy for her to endorse a candidate, either publically or behind the scenes. While her endorsement by no means guarantees the Latino vote, it does help a great bit. Perhaps even more importantly, one does not want Ana Mariela to openly denounce them if they wish to have a fruitful relationship with the Cuban community of Miami. She is unaffiliated with any particular party and is instead concerned with 'personal integrity' and 'moral character'.%0a%0a!!!!! %25mortal%25 '''Missing person's report''' (Police, PIs):%0a%25%25 In early October of 2019 Ana Mariela's youngest son, Gabriel, was noted as a missing person. Last heard of as traveling towards California, he was lost after leaving Florida and never checked into his hotel. After a short investigation, the case become cold. Refusing to give up hope Ana Mariela employed a few PIs to look for clues, none of them with any success. Are you related to the investigations in any form or manner? A detective? A PI? A professional counselor?%0a%0a!!!!! %25mortal%25 '''Panem et circenses ''' (Music, Culture, Media):%0a%25%25 Ana Mariel is invested in the cultural scene of Miami and making sure younger generations do not forget their roots, ranging from programs encouraging the development of musical talents to community theatre projects and dancing sessions. While this naturally reaches people on an amateur level Ana Mariel has allies both in media and the finer rungs of society. All those galas need performers to entertain and while by no means a professional herself, Ana Mariel was a dancer and a songstress in her youth. From time to time she finds herself persuaded to partake in the action on stage. Has she performed with you? Were you once an amateur performer whose dance group survived thanks to a timely intervention from above?%0a%0a!!!!! %25mortal%25 '''One big family''' (Exile Cubans, Anyone):%0a%25%25 Despite having one son gone missing, Ana Mariela still has a big family. A husband and three adult children, not to mention a number of siblings, nieces, nephews, cousins and so on, all centered in Miami. Perhaps your character shares a literal blood connection with her, through marriage or by birth?%0a%0a!!!!! %25werewolf%25 '''Dogs in the yard''' (Werewolves):%0a%25%25 While by no means a werewolf herself, or even wolf-blooded, it is a trait that runs in her family. From what it seems, unbeknownst to her, there have been werewolves in her family in the past, and might very possibly be more of them in the future. If you're a local werewolf you probably know that it is best to either befriend her or stay away from her, unless you want to trespass on another werewolf's territory. %0a%0a(:tableend:)%0a%0a!! %25mortal%25 '''+Allies, Contacts & Retainers+'''%0a-----%0aWith half a lifetime spent in the public eye, there is no wonder Ana Mariela has made a lot of acquaintances, allies, friends and even enemies...%0a%0a(:cellnr width=50%25 align=left style='padding-left: 0px;':)%0a%25lfloat text-align=center width=180 margin-top=0px margin-right=7px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=8px newwin%25 [[https://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/Players/RobertoLuna|https://i.imgur.com/E3mZByQ.jpg]]  %25werewolf%25 '''Roberto Luna'''%0a%0a%25werewolf%25 His grandfather helped Ana Mariela's parents settle in Miami and as Roberto came to be, Ana Mariela had come to a position where she was able to return the favor.

Ana Mariela Blanco arrived from Cuba in 1970 as a little girl, making use of the %25newwin%25 [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Flights|Freedom Flights]] with her family. Starting off decently modestly she made a face for herself in the local news as a fifteen-year-old when she, using a portable tape recorder, caught some faculty members of her school, Miami Senior High School, admitting to embezzlement and abusive treatment of fellow staff and students. After the reveal, she was interviewed by a few local newspapers and became fully dedicated to the idealistic goal of improving the world.%0a%3c %0a%3c In her late teens, she attended Florida International University, studying to become a journalist but dropped out after a year when she met the love of her life, the medical student (and now surgeon) Ernesto Castillo. The two of them got married shortly after finding true love with each other and soon enough Ana Mariela found herself combining the life of a housewife with that of the political activist. With great fervor, she attended, joined and formed a number of NGOs. To list a few, she joined the Red Cross, various church and charity organizations, Cuban culture groups, Cuban study groups, Peace and Democracy for Cuba interest organizations, political committees, neighborhood associations and so on.%0a%3c %0a%3c With an uncanny ability for organizational work and politicking, she made her way from 'enthusiastic member' to an 'influence for change' through a number of them. As her husband became a successful surgeon and started making a lot of money, she had the resources to organize her own charity drives, or at least be a driving force behind them. She used her resources to protect the interests of her fellow Latin people, in particular, the Cuban exiles. She used her Cuban passport to travel to Cuba to meet with long distant relatives, and carry messages for those who were unable to take the trip themselves (for economical or political reasons). %0a%3c %0a%3c Shortly put, she slowly but surely became a pillar of the community. A mother of four, a woman of faith who speaks for 'the little guy' when the big city politicians show up with their schemes and plans.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!! %25mortal%25 Recent History:%0a%3c Tragedy struck the Castillo household in early October 2019 when the youngest son of their home, the eighteen-year-old Gabriel Castillo was reported a missing person. He went to visit California for a short vacation but never managed to reach his total. The police found nothing and while Ana Mariela employed PIs to continue the search it has been fruitless. After a short break from the public scene, the matriarch of the Castillo family has returned to public life once more with new energy and vigor. %0a%3c %0a%3c [[%3c%3c]] %0a%3c !!! %25mortal%25 Role Playing Hooks:%0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=10px width=405 margin-right=0px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=10px newwin%25 [[https://i.imgur.com/HgMM6Yi.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/HgMM6Yi.jpg]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %25mortal%25 '''''Mamá Ana (Exile Cubans, Anyone):'''''\\%0a%3c %25%25 Even during her teenage years, Ana Mariela tried to improve the world, be it through charity works, community cleanup initiatives or even Neighborhood watch organizations. This spark of idealism didn't fade to embers as she matured, but rather burned even more brightly. These days she is invested in a number of NGOs primarily focusing on Exile Cubans and other members of the Latino community, including drives to help Latinos access higher education, sports grants, support for victims of crime, therapy to beat drug abuse and much, much more. \\%0a%3c It is also well known in the community that if you need something in particular and have no one else to turn to, you can always seek Mamá Ana out. She looks out for her own. \\%0a%3c Your brother went missing? You're having a hard time getting the right permits to open your business? Your father is sick and you cannot afford the bills? Come to Mamá Ana. She helps you out of the good of her heart.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25mortal%25 '''''Driving-spirit (NGO's, Charities, Anyone):'''''\\%0a%3c %25%25 If there's a drive, charity, grant or fund for it, there's a good chance Ana Mariela has been involved. Keep Miami drug free? Check. Get our teens out of gangs? Check. Study grants for talented youth? Check. Promotion of Cuban culture and heritage? Check. Support groups for returning veterans? Check. Support for children with a parent in prison? Check. Aid for disaster victims? Check. Justice for victims of crime? Check. \\%0a%3c If there's an organization for it then Ana Mariela is either on the committee, board or in the background, giving advice and her support. It is easy for her to befriend people who are either active in the communities themselves or seeking their aid. While most of her work is at the top these days, she can still be seen from time to time working at the very grassroots level, standing in soup kitchens or changing the bedsheets in local homeless shelters.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25mortal%25 '''''Champagne and gala dresses (High society):'''''\\%0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=10px width=405 margin-right=0px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=10px newwin%25 [[https://i.imgur.com/Q7ImnCO.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/Q7ImnCO.jpg]]%0a%3c %25%25 To some a concert performed in front of the economic and cultural elite of Maimi is a time of entertainment. To many, however, it is also a chance to grease elbows while also establishing your status as a power broker and a 'somebody' in the city. Ana Mariela definitely belongs to the latter and if you've ever attended any event of importance in the last ten years there's a good chance you've at least shook hands and spent some time mingling. If you in any shape or form carry some sort of weight in the community, there's a better chance still that Ana Mariela made sure you met again.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25mortal%25 '''''Backroom deals and elections (Politics):'''''\\%0a%3c %25%25 Ana Mariela is famous in Miami, especially among its Cuban population, and while not everyone agrees with what she has to say, many people listen when she speaks. Thanks to her extensive network with various NGOs, charities and other organizations it is easy for her to endorse a candidate, either publically or behind the scenes. While her endorsement by no means guarantees the Latino vote, it does help a great bit. \\%0a%3c Perhaps even more importantly, one does not want Ana Mariela to openly denounce them if they wish to have a fruitful relationship with the Cuban community of Miami. She is unaffiliated with any particular party and is instead concerned with 'personal integrity' and 'moral character'.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25mortal%25 '''''Panem et circenses (Music, Culture, Media):'''''\\%0a%3c %25%25 Ana Mariel is invested in the cultural scene of Miami and making sure younger generations do not forget their roots, ranging from programs encouraging the development of musical talents to community theatre projects and dancing sessions. While this naturally reaches people on an amateur level Ana Mariel has allies both in media and the finer rungs of society. %0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=10px width=405 margin-right=0px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=10px newwin%25 [[https://i.imgur.com/qBKEtuG.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/qBKEtuG.jpg]]%0a%3c All those galas need performers to entertain and while by no means a professional herself, Ana Mariel was a dancer and a songstress in her youth. From time to time she finds herself persuaded to partake in the action on stage. Has she performed with you? Were you once an amateur performer whose dance group survived thanks to a timely intervention from above?%0a%3c %0a%3c %25mortal%25 '''''Missing person's report (Police, PIs):'''''\\%0a%3c %25%25 In early October of 2019 Ana Mariela's youngest son, Gabriel, was noted as a missing person. Last heard of as traveling towards California, he was lost after leaving Florida and never checked into his hotel. After a short investigation, the case become cold. Refusing to give up hope Ana Mariela employed a few PIs to look for clues, none of them with any success. Are you related to the investigations in any form or manner? A detective? A PI? A professional counselor?%0a%3c %0a%3c %25mortal%25 '''''One big family (Exile Cubans, Anyone):'''''\\%0a%3c %25%25 Despite having one son gone missing, Ana Mariela still has a big family.

'''+Appearance & Mannerisms+'''%0a> -----%0a> '''''The Good Lady Sinead Kinsella''''' is a woman of grace and status, moving with the confidence of someone used to being aristocracy without the need of flaunting it like the nouveau riche. Rarely does she not afford a smile, a courteous dip or a kind statement. Those who have known Sinead for any longer period of time however know that behind the facade of soft smiles and an absolutely excellent understanding of etiquette and social rules lies a heart and mind blanketed in ice. %0a> %0a> She's never rude, never sarcastic, never disrespectful... But she can become a battering ram should anyone dare to step in the way. Someone used to getting their way does not like it when her voice is not heeded, and she is very much her Sire's daughter, known to be just as ruthless as Patrick should the situation warrant it. Still, if on her good side, Sinead is a most pleasant woman of class, like a fish in water when dressed in a gown, listening to soft murmurs accompanied by champagne glasses and polite chuckles. %0a> %0a> As a woman of the first half of the last century, she would be considered conservative if not reactionary by the standards of most modern people who inhabit the nights of Portland... But then again, she is an Invictus of the Ventrue clan. Does one expect anything else?%0a> %0a> %0a> !! '''+History & Past+'''%0a> ----%0a> As the current Matriarch of the Kinsella family, her history is well-known among those with an understanding for the Kindred city politics in general and those of the Invictus and Ventrue affiliations in particular. By the end of the Great Turmoil, in 1986, Patrick Kinsella, the alder patriarch and embodiment of all that was Kinsella entered torpor and has not awoken since. His childer and grandchilder, among them Sinead, gathered and elected a new temporary leader. What was temporary has hardened into permanence however as Patrick has yet to awake and Sinead now rules in his stead with the same iron fist her Sire used to.%0a> %0a> Most mortals would not know she exists, but she is a well known figure in the Invictus, giving her silent approval to almost any and all moves proclaimed by the Council and the Prince. At least for now...%0a> %0a> !! '''+Allies, Contacts & Retainers+'''%0a> -----%0a> The family is filled to the brim with vampires, ghouls and mortals sworn to protect the Kinsella name and serve their elders.

In unlife, Sinead later sired Deirdre who now acts as Lady Speaker on behalf of Kinsella interests in general and Sinead's interests in particular. The two of them get along amiably, but there's often a veiled guilt tormenting the elder sister when in the presence of Deirdre. Additionally, Deirdre's advice reaches her sister unfiltered and it is rare for Sinead to deny her younger sibling time and support in any and all situations.%0a> %0a> %25rfloat%25 [[http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/index.php?n=Players.AoifeKinsella|http://i.imgur.com/DylPHhR.jpg]]%0a> %0a> '''The daughter:''' As Sinead's firstborn child and childer, Aiofe is the pride of her mother.

It would seem that we are. Excellent.]%0a> %0a> %25rfloat%25 http://i.imgur.com/XeLNVMs.jpg | %0a> '''The Ally:''' This Player Character is associated with the Kinsella in general and Sinead in particular. Most likely they have known each other for quite a while, Sinead doesn't give trust to strangers after all... Unless the circumstances truly demand it. As an ally of Sinead one has access to large network of contacts, offering access to the political spheres of Portland, both supernatural and mundane. Naturally, an ally is more than just someone who scratches your back. They are a friend, and Sinead would enjoy meeting up even for non-business related matters.%0a> %0a> %25rfloat%25 http://i.imgur.com/MGxu49A.jpg |%0a> '''The weak spot:''' Everyone has something or someone they are weak to. An old flame. Someone who has dirt on you. Someone who saved your life and now you owe them yours. This kind of player character relationship can create a lot of interesting tension and drama when used right. Did Sinead make your heart stir and now you cannot get her out of your mind? Or did you perhaps manage to seduce the Ice Queen? Or hold dirt on her? %0a> %0a> %25rfloat%25 http://i.imgur.com/XeLNVMs.jpg | %0a> '''The Associate:''' This Player Character is in it for the business. They may be a recently recruited advisor or bodyguard, or perhaps they have an understanding regarding legal or not so legal affairs. Chances are good that both stand to gain from an amiable agreement, while both also stand to lose should the agreement end. However, there's no guarantee of trust and most certainly no guarantee of friendship. %0a> %0a> !! '''+Roleplaying Hooks+'''%0a> -----%0a> '''The Iron Fist''' (The Kinsella family, Supernaturals): The Lady Matriarch Kinsella knows every courteous title, how to bow, how to speak and how to compliment. But rarely does her proper smile reach her eyes. Living after the Machiavellian doctrine that it is better to be feared than to be loved she runs the family in very much the same way her Sire did, by commanding with a tightly clenched fist. She makes her presence known to her subordinates and often hands out orders and commands to anyone below her rank. If you're of the Kinsella family, it is extremely unlikely that you have not encountered the Ice Queen in one way or another. Additionally, having constructive business with the Kinsella family means that ultimately, you have to reach an agreement with Sinead, or at least with one of her ambassadors and envoys.%0a> %0a> %0a> '''The Motherly Matriarch''' (The Kinsella family): Sinead looks after her own, as expected of someone who holds family in such high regard. Looking after her own does not mean looking after the individual however, as some unruly younger members of the Dynasty often come to realize. It is a collective, and anything a single member does prides or shames the entire name. Time and time again younger members have been reined in with personal goals and ambitions having been (forcefully) put aside to maintain the good name of the family. Were you ever unruly? Or were you a bad influence on a Kinsella family member and had a run-in with the Kinsellan dynasty because of it? Or were you in a bad spot and needed help with an employment, a lawsuit or just hard cash? The family will provide...%0a> %0a> %0a> '''Venomous City Politics''' (Vampires, Invictus): Sinead is the highest ranking member of the Kinsella family, a faction of power within Portland vampire politics. For now, she's been doing her best to grease palms and simply support the current prince and their advisors... But it is well known that she feels contempt for the state her family was left in after the turmoil and wishes to see the Kinsella family rise again. The problem with rising is that you need someone to push down. Are you a rival, a friend or a new player? You can rest assured that Sinead has approached you.%0a> %0a> '''Almoner''' (Vampires/Mortal, Any): The Almoners of the Invictus see it as their duty to care for the downtrodden and those out of luck, kindred or kine. Some vampires are Almoners out of genuine belief of charity, others believe that poverty and desperation can create an unstable domain while some use the desperate to their own means... Acting as an Almoner is one of the few times that Sinead will be seen in mortal society. Are you someone without a home, with enemies or down on your luck? Did social services tell you off or did your Domitor leave you on the sidewalk when they got bored of you? If so, chances are good that Sinead stepped in to aid you, either a week ago or a decade ago. Sinead helps... And Sinead remembers.%0a> %0a> !! '''+Quotes+'''%0a> ----%0a> "Blood makes us related.

Ana Mariela Blanco arrived from Cuba in 1970 as a little girl, making use of the %25newwin%25 [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Flights|Freedom Flights]] with her family. Starting off decently modestly she made a face for herself in the local news as a fifteen-year-old when she, using a portable tape recorder, caught some faculty members of her school, Miami Senior High School, admitting to embezzlement and abusive treatment of fellow staff and students. After the reveal, she was interviewed by a few local newspapers and became fully dedicated to the idealistic goal of improving the world.%0a> %0a> In her late teens, she attended Florida International University, studying to become a journalist but dropped out after a year when she met the love of her life, the medical student (and now surgeon) Ernesto Castillo. The two of them got married shortly after finding true love with each other and soon enough Ana Mariela found herself combining the life of a housewife with that of the political activist. With great fervor, she attended, joined and formed a number of NGOs. To list a few, she joined the Red Cross, various church and charity organizations, Cuban culture groups, Cuban study groups, Peace and Democracy for Cuba interest organizations, political committees, neighborhood associations and so on.%0a> %0a> With an uncanny ability for organizational work and politicking, she made her way from 'enthusiastic member' to an 'influence for change' through a number of them. As her husband became a successful surgeon and started making a lot of money, she had the resources to organize her own charity drives, or at least be a driving force behind them. She used her resources to protect the interests of her fellow Latin people, in particular, the Cuban exiles. She used her Cuban passport to travel to Cuba to meet with long distant relatives, and carry messages for those who were unable to take the trip themselves (for economical or political reasons). %0a> %0a> Shortly put, she slowly but surely became a pillar of the community. A mother of four, a woman of faith who speaks for 'the little guy' when the big city politicians show up with their schemes and plans.%0a> %0a> !!! %25mortal%25 Recent History:%0a> Tragedy struck the Castillo household in early October 2019 when the youngest son of their home, the eighteen-year-old Gabriel Castillo was reported a missing person. He went to visit California for a short vacation but never managed to reach his total. The police found nothing and while Ana Mariela employed PIs to continue the search it has been fruitless. After a short break from the public scene, the matriarch of the Castillo family has returned to public life once more with new energy and vigor. %0a> %0a> [[%3c%3c]] %0a> !!! %25mortal%25 Role Playing Hooks:%0a> %0a> %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=10px width=405 margin-right=0px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=10px newwin%25 [[https://i.imgur.com/HgMM6Yi.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/HgMM6Yi.jpg]]%0a> %0a> %25mortal%25 '''''Mamá Ana (Exile Cubans, Anyone):'''''\\%0a> %25%25 Even during her teenage years, Ana Mariela tried to improve the world, be it through charity works, community cleanup initiatives or even Neighborhood watch organizations. This spark of idealism didn't fade to embers as she matured, but rather burned even more brightly. These days she is invested in a number of NGOs primarily focusing on Exile Cubans and other members of the Latino community, including drives to help Latinos access higher education, sports grants, support for victims of crime, therapy to beat drug abuse and much, much more. \\%0a> It is also well known in the community that if you need something in particular and have no one else to turn to, you can always seek Mamá Ana out. She looks out for her own. \\%0a> Your brother went missing? You're having a hard time getting the right permits to open your business? Your father is sick and you cannot afford the bills? Come to Mamá Ana. She helps you out of the good of her heart.%0a> %0a> %25mortal%25 '''''Driving-spirit (NGO's, Charities, Anyone):'''''\\%0a> %25%25 If there's a drive, charity, grant or fund for it, there's a good chance Ana Mariela has been involved. Keep Miami drug free? Check. Get our teens out of gangs? Check. Study grants for talented youth? Check. Promotion of Cuban culture and heritage? Check. Support groups for returning veterans? Check. Support for children with a parent in prison? Check. Aid for disaster victims? Check. Justice for victims of crime? Check. \\%0a> If there's an organization for it then Ana Mariela is either on the committee, board or in the background, giving advice and her support. It is easy for her to befriend people who are either active in the communities themselves or seeking their aid. While most of her work is at the top these days, she can still be seen from time to time working at the very grassroots level, standing in soup kitchens or changing the bedsheets in local homeless shelters.%0a> %0a> %25mortal%25 '''''Champagne and gala dresses (High society):'''''\\%0a> %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=10px width=405 margin-right=0px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=10px newwin%25 [[https://i.imgur.com/Q7ImnCO.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/Q7ImnCO.jpg]]%0a> %25%25 To some a concert performed in front of the economic and cultural elite of Maimi is a time of entertainment. To many, however, it is also a chance to grease elbows while also establishing your status as a power broker and a 'somebody' in the city. Ana Mariela definitely belongs to the latter and if you've ever attended any event of importance in the last ten years there's a good chance you've at least shook hands and spent some time mingling. If you in any shape or form carry some sort of weight in the community, there's a better chance still that Ana Mariela made sure you met again.%0a> %0a> %25mortal%25 '''''Backroom deals and elections (Politics):'''''\\%0a> %25%25 Ana Mariela is famous in Miami, especially among its Cuban population, and while not everyone agrees with what she has to say, many people listen when she speaks. Thanks to her extensive network with various NGOs, charities and other organizations it is easy for her to endorse a candidate, either publically or behind the scenes. While her endorsement by no means guarantees the Latino vote, it does help a great bit. \\%0a> Perhaps even more importantly, one does not want Ana Mariela to openly denounce them if they wish to have a fruitful relationship with the Cuban community of Miami. She is unaffiliated with any particular party and is instead concerned with 'personal integrity' and 'moral character'.%0a> %0a> %25mortal%25 '''''Panem et circenses (Music, Culture, Media):'''''\\%0a> %25%25 Ana Mariel is invested in the cultural scene of Miami and making sure younger generations do not forget their roots, ranging from programs encouraging the development of musical talents to community theatre projects and dancing sessions. While this naturally reaches people on an amateur level Ana Mariel has allies both in media and the finer rungs of society. %0a> %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=10px width=405 margin-right=0px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=10px newwin%25 [[https://i.imgur.com/qBKEtuG.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/qBKEtuG.jpg]]%0a> All those galas need performers to entertain and while by no means a professional herself, Ana Mariel was a dancer and a songstress in her youth. From time to time she finds herself persuaded to partake in the action on stage. Has she performed with you? Were you once an amateur performer whose dance group survived thanks to a timely intervention from above?%0a> %0a> %25mortal%25 '''''Missing person's report (Police, PIs):'''''\\%0a> %25%25 In early October of 2019 Ana Mariela's youngest son, Gabriel, was noted as a missing person. Last heard of as traveling towards California, he was lost after leaving Florida and never checked into his hotel. After a short investigation, the case become cold. Refusing to give up hope Ana Mariela employed a few PIs to look for clues, none of them with any success. Are you related to the investigations in any form or manner? A detective? A PI? A professional counselor?%0a> %0a> %25mortal%25 '''''One big family (Exile Cubans, Anyone):'''''\\%0a> %25%25 Despite having one son gone missing, Ana Mariela still has a big family. A husband and three adult children, not to mention a number of siblings, nieces, nephews, cousins and so on, all centered in Miami. Perhaps your character shares a literal blood connection with her, through marriage or by birth?%0a> %0a> %25werewolf%25 '''''Dogs in the yard (Werewolves):'''''\\%0a> %25%25 While by no means a werewolf herself, or even wolf-blooded, it is a trait that runs in her family. From what it seems, unbeknownst to her, there have been werewolves in her family in the past, and might very possibly be more of them in the future. \\%0a> If you're a local werewolf you probably know that it is best to either befriend her or stay away from her, unless you want to trespass on another werewolf's territory. %0a> %0a> [[%3c%3c]] %0a> !!! %25mortal%25 Contacts:%0a> %0a> (:cellnr width=50%25 align=left style='padding-left: 0px;':)%0a> %25lfloat text-align=center width=180 margin-top=0px margin-right=7px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=8px newwin%25 [[https://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/Players/RobertoLuna|https://i.imgur.com/E3mZByQ.jpg]]  %25werewolf%25 '''Roberto Luna:'''%0a> %0a> %25werewolf%25 An old family acquaintance and political ally, details to be hashed out.%0a>  %0a> (:cell width=50%25 align=left style='padding-right: 0px;':)%0a> %25lfloat text-align=center width=180 margin-top=0px margin-right=7px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=8px newwin%25 [[https://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/?n=Players.AnthaFeedingFrenzySalazar|https://i.imgur.com/AcUMIqV.png]]  %25beast%25 '''Antha Salazar'''%0a> %0a> %25beast%25 Her father was a friend of my family and I remember little Antha's cooking with warmth.

'''+Appearance & Mannerisms+'''%0a%3c -----%0a%3c '''''The Good Lady Sinead Kinsella''''' is a woman of grace and status, moving with the confidence of someone used to being aristocracy without the need of flaunting it like the nouveau riche. Rarely does she not afford a smile, a courteous dip or a kind statement. Those who have known Sinead for any longer period of time however know that behind the facade of soft smiles and an absolutely excellent understanding of etiquette and social rules lies a heart and mind blanketed in ice. %0a%3c %0a%3c She's never rude, never sarcastic, never disrespectful... But she can become a battering ram should anyone dare to step in the way. Someone used to getting their way does not like it when her voice is not heeded, and she is very much her Sire's daughter, known to be just as ruthless as Patrick should the situation warrant it. Still, if on her good side, Sinead is a most pleasant woman of class, like a fish in water when dressed in a gown, listening to soft murmurs accompanied by champagne glasses and polite chuckles. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a woman of the first half of the last century, she would be considered conservative if not reactionary by the standards of most modern people who inhabit the nights of Portland... But then again, she is an Invictus of the Ventrue clan. Does one expect anything else?%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !! '''+History & Past+'''%0a%3c ----%0a%3c As the current Matriarch of the Kinsella family, her history is well-known among those with an understanding for the Kindred city politics in general and those of the Invictus and Ventrue affiliations in particular. By the end of the Great Turmoil, in 1986, Patrick Kinsella, the alder patriarch and embodiment of all that was Kinsella entered torpor and has not awoken since. His childer and grandchilder, among them Sinead, gathered and elected a new temporary leader. What was temporary has hardened into permanence however as Patrick has yet to awake and Sinead now rules in his stead with the same iron fist her Sire used to.%0a%3c %0a%3c Most mortals would not know she exists, but she is a well known figure in the Invictus, giving her silent approval to almost any and all moves proclaimed by the Council and the Prince. At least for now...%0a%3c %0a%3c !! '''+Allies, Contacts & Retainers+'''%0a%3c -----%0a%3c The family is filled to the brim with vampires, ghouls and mortals sworn to protect the Kinsella name and serve their elders. Most of them don't even know the elders exist...%0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat%25 [[http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/?n=Players.DeirdreKinsella|http://i.imgur.com/6NhdZVm.png]] | %0a%3c '''The little sister:''' Despite looking very little alike upon first glance, the two women were, allegedly, mortal sisters in life. In unlife, Sinead later sired Deirdre who now acts as Lady Speaker on behalf of Kinsella interests in general and Sinead's interests in particular. The two of them get along amiably, but there's often a veiled guilt tormenting the elder sister when in the presence of Deirdre. Additionally, Deirdre's advice reaches her sister unfiltered and it is rare for Sinead to deny her younger sibling time and support in any and all situations.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat%25 [[http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/index.php?n=Players.AoifeKinsella|http://i.imgur.com/DylPHhR.jpg]]%0a%3c %0a%3c '''The daughter:''' As Sinead's firstborn child and childer, Aiofe is the pride of her mother. [More to come here as the player establishes their character further.

It would seem that we are. Excellent.]%0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat%25 http://i.imgur.com/XeLNVMs.jpg | %0a%3c '''The Ally:''' This Player Character is associated with the Kinsella in general and Sinead in particular. Most likely they have known each other for quite a while, Sinead doesn't give trust to strangers after all... Unless the circumstances truly demand it. As an ally of Sinead one has access to large network of contacts, offering access to the political spheres of Portland, both supernatural and mundane. Naturally, an ally is more than just someone who scratches your back. They are a friend, and Sinead would enjoy meeting up even for non-business related matters.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat%25 http://i.imgur.com/MGxu49A.jpg |%0a%3c '''The weak spot:''' Everyone has something or someone they are weak to. An old flame. Someone who has dirt on you. Someone who saved your life and now you owe them yours. This kind of player character relationship can create a lot of interesting tension and drama when used right. Did Sinead make your heart stir and now you cannot get her out of your mind? Or did you perhaps manage to seduce the Ice Queen? Or hold dirt on her? %0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat%25 http://i.imgur.com/XeLNVMs.jpg | %0a%3c '''The Associate:''' This Player Character is in it for the business. They may be a recently recruited advisor or bodyguard, or perhaps they have an understanding regarding legal or not so legal affairs. Chances are good that both stand to gain from an amiable agreement, while both also stand to lose should the agreement end. However, there's no guarantee of trust and most certainly no guarantee of friendship. %0a%3c %0a%3c !! '''+Roleplaying Hooks+'''%0a%3c -----%0a%3c '''The Iron Fist''' (The Kinsella family, Supernaturals): The Lady Matriarch Kinsella knows every courteous title, how to bow, how to speak and how to compliment. But rarely does her proper smile reach her eyes. Living after the Machiavellian doctrine that it is better to be feared than to be loved she runs the family in very much the same way her Sire did, by commanding with a tightly clenched fist. She makes her presence known to her subordinates and often hands out orders and commands to anyone below her rank. If you're of the Kinsella family, it is extremely unlikely that you have not encountered the Ice Queen in one way or another. Additionally, having constructive business with the Kinsella family means that ultimately, you have to reach an agreement with Sinead, or at least with one of her ambassadors and envoys.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c '''The Motherly Matriarch''' (The Kinsella family): Sinead looks after her own, as expected of someone who holds family in such high regard. Looking after her own does not mean looking after the individual however, as some unruly younger members of the Dynasty often come to realize. It is a collective, and anything a single member does prides or shames the entire name. Time and time again younger members have been reined in with personal goals and ambitions having been (forcefully) put aside to maintain the good name of the family. Were you ever unruly? Or were you a bad influence on a Kinsella family member and had a run-in with the Kinsellan dynasty because of it? Or were you in a bad spot and needed help with an employment, a lawsuit or just hard cash? The family will provide...%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c '''Venomous City Politics''' (Vampires, Invictus): Sinead is the highest ranking member of the Kinsella family, a faction of power within Portland vampire politics. For now, she's been doing her best to grease palms and simply support the current prince and their advisors... But it is well known that she feels contempt for the state her family was left in after the turmoil and wishes to see the Kinsella family rise again. The problem with rising is that you need someone to push down. Are you a rival, a friend or a new player? You can rest assured that Sinead has approached you.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Almoner''' (Vampires/Mortal, Any): The Almoners of the Invictus see it as their duty to care for the downtrodden and those out of luck, kindred or kine. Some vampires are Almoners out of genuine belief of charity, others believe that poverty and desperation can create an unstable domain while some use the desperate to their own means... Acting as an Almoner is one of the few times that Sinead will be seen in mortal society. Are you someone without a home, with enemies or down on your luck? Did social services tell you off or did your Domitor leave you on the sidewalk when they got bored of you? If so, chances are good that Sinead stepped in to aid you, either a week ago or a decade ago. Sinead helps... And Sinead remembers.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!

Ana Mariela Blanco arrived from Cuba in 1970 as a little girl, making use of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Flights|Freedom Flights]] with her family. Starting off decently modestly she made a face for herself in the local news as a fifteen-year-old when she, using a portable tape recorder, caught some faculty members of her school admitting to embezzlement and abusive treatment of fellow staff and students. After the reveal, she was interviewed by a few local newspapers and became fully dedicated to the idealistic goal of improving the world.%0a%3c %0a%3c In her late teens, she attended Florida International University, studying to become a journalist but dropped out after a year when she met the love of her life, the medical student (and now surgeon) Ernesto Castillo. The two of them got married shortly after getting finding true love with each other and soon enough Ana Mariela found herself combining the life of a housewife with that of the political activist. With great fervor, she attended, joined and formed a number of NGOs. To list a few, she joined the Red Cross, various church and charity organizations, Cuban culture groups, Cuban study groups, Peace and Democracy for Cuba interest organizations, political committees, neighborhood associations and so on.%0a%3c %0a%3c With an uncanny ability for organizational work and politicking, she made her way from 'enthusiastic member' to an 'influence for change' through a number of them. As her husband became a successful surgeon and started making a lot of money, she had the resources to organize her own charity drives, or at least be a driving force behind them. She used her resources to protect the interests of her fellow Latin people, in particular, the Cuban exiles. She used her Cuban passport to travel to Cuba to meet with long distant relatives, and carry messages for those who were unable to take the trip themselves (for economical or political reasons). %0a%3c %0a%3c Shortly put, she slowly but surely became a pillar of the community.
