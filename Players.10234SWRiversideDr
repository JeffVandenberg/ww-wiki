It’s larger than it looks. While there is some open concept going on, the main floor isn’t what you’d call a great room. Instead, the rooms flow into one another with some degree of open concept which works well.%0a%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=25px margin-right=25px width=250px height=250px%25https://i.imgur.com/JD9mfwE.jpg%0aThe middle of the kitchen and keeping room is vertically open to a balconied area on the story above and a dramatic fireplace on one wall contributes to the warmth of the area.
