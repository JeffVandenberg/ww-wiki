She has thick eyebrows and dark blue eyes with brown hair reaching to just below her jawline. Full lips, easy with a smile, a beauty mark on the upper left above her lip, she has, about her nature, a kindness and approachability and, though not show-stopping, she's a pretty young woman. She is healthy, slender but not particularly athletically built, even if she is nimble; her arms are not toned nor is her mid, but instead she is rather soft.%0a%0aHer nose and ears are pierced but otherwise she displays no decoration, tattoo or otherwise. Her hair is currently kept short, just below her jaw and kept loose, usually. She habitually clothes herself in flowy dresses and heeled sandals and almost always keeps a black crossbody courier bag on her.%0a%0aOridia's melodic voice has been called empyrean as perhaps there is something heavenly about her tone, though entirely natural. This comes through far more clearly in her Mien and here has an aura of otherworldliness. Her accent is a proper Oxford English. She holds herself proper as well, back straight and her movement elegant, as wont the Fairest. Even so, haughty is not a way she could be described though she, being of her Seeming, is not without pomposity completely. Though her head may appear to be in the heavens, quite literally in her Mien, she keeps herself grounded. Easy to smile, easy to converse with, friend to anyone.%0a%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a(:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 bgcolor=#0d0d0d:)%0a(:cellnr width=100%25 bgcolor=#0d0d0d:)%0a|| %25thumb%25[[https://imgur.com/d0qy57g.png|https://imgur.com/d0qy57g.png]] || %25thumb%25[[https://imgur.com/Ej2JTWn.png|https://imgur.com/Ej2JTWn.png]] || %25thumb%25[[https://imgur.com/tUVaPlS.png|https://imgur.com/tUVaPlS.png]] || %25thumb%25[[https://imgur.com/CBQBIws.png|https://imgur.com/CBQBIws.png]] || %25thumb%25%0a(:tableend:)%0a%0a----%0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Mien''%0a%0a%25center%25The changes arrive most strikingly with her eyes.

Her eyes are further unique in that her irises are far larger than those of a normal person. Next her ears are elfin, pointed. Her fingers on both hands look stained, her thumb and first two fingers are blue and the latter two are purple.

She is healthy, slender but not particularly athletically built, even if she is nimble; her arms are not toned nor is her mid, but instead she is rather soft.%0a%3c %0a%3c Her nose and ears are pierced but otherwise she displays no decoration, tattoo or otherwise. Her hair is currently kept short, just below her jaw and kept loose, usually. She habitually clothes herself in flowy dresses and heeled sandals and almost always keeps a black crossbody courier bag on her.%0a%3c %0a%3c Oridia's melodic voice has been called ‘empyrean’, as perhaps there is something heavenly about her tone, though entirely natural. This comes through far more clearly in her Mien and here has an aura of otherworldness. Her accent is a proper Oxford English. She holds herself proper as well, back straight and her movement elegant, as wont the Fairest. Even so, haughty is not a way she could be described though she, being of her Seeming, is not without pomposity completely. Though her head may appear to be in the heavens, quite literally in her Mien, she keeps herself grounded; easy to smile, easy to converse with, anyone’s friend.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> %25center%25A woman in her mid-twenties with a fairly average heigh of 5 feet 6 inches.

Like an evening sky, they are the blue of the early night, the late day; a crescent moon hangs in both pupils while clouds drift idly along. What’s more, her irises are far larger than that of a normal person. Next her ears are elfin, pointed. Her fingers on both hands look stained, her thumb and first two fingers are blue and the latter two are purple. Running along her left arm is a calligraphy-like design, matching the blue and purple color of her fingers.%0a---%0a> %25center%25The changes arrive most strikingly with her eyes.
