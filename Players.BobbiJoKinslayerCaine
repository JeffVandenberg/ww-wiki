She has curly blonde hair that often falls to her shoulders, and warm brown eyes that once were orange and odd, but now are...just brown, pretty in their own way and warm like chocolate. She dresses for whatever occasion she's going to and whatever mood she's in. She often wears makeup, usually dark eyeliner paired with lip gloss. She's not a girl that fades into a crowd, often standing out either in what she wears or the way she smiles or how her curls tumble over each other in an effort to reach her cheeks first.%0a%0aBobbi Jo has a few tattoos; corvids coming up from inky spills over the long thin scars that run up along the inside her forearm being the easiest to view. A heart shaped from fire on the small of her back. A cross on her left hand between her pointer finger and thumb. Over her heart is a new tattoo, the Barbie logo with her own kissprint dotting the i. Along her back are small circles pierced into her skin on either side of her back, running up the length of it, and fed through that are pink and black laces.%0a%0aThose that get to view her scars, find that the southern Rahu has been in more than a few fights. Aside from the scars on her forearms, she has a variety of scars that speak to that. Claw marks, bite marks, burns, knife wounds and even bullet scars make stories out of her flesh, often covered into tattoos or shown proudly. Bobbi Jo is not afraid of her stories, even if many of them aren't happy. There's a newer mark on her left wrist, stylized in the same way as the Renatus Dynasty seal.%0a%0a|| %25color=#AB0000%25Height:||5'6"|| %25color=#AB0000%25Weight:||110lbs|| %25color=#AB0000%25Complexion:||Tanned|| %25color=#AB0000%25Hair Color:||Blonde||%0a|| %25color=#AB0000%25Eye Color:||Warm Brown|| %25color=#AB0000%25Date of Birth:||8/21/1995|| %25color=#AB0000%25Place of Birth:||Tennessee|| %25color=#AB0000%25Accent:||Southern||%0a|| %25color=#AB0000%25Build Type:||Skinny || %25color=#AB0000%25Scars:||Numerous|| %25color=#AB0000%25Tattoos:||Many || %25color=#AB0000%25Piercings:||Lip, Nose, others||%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/Ushcg0z.png%0aBobbi Jo is not the brightest bulb in the box, at least not when it comes to book learnin', but she's street smart and savvy, and has a good eye for the right sort of mark. She's clever, and fun to be around so long as her hair trigger temper isn't set off, then she's swinging for the fences - and these days that trigger seems to be easier and easier to pull. Despite all of this, once Bobbi Jo decides to befriend someone and let them them just a little past the walls, she can be loyal to a fault. %0a%0a-----%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/DqXSEyM.png%0a-----%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/0bPMYWt.png%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #FF7654' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=325px height=325px%25https://i.imgur.com/dMdPSFI.jpg%0a*'''%25color=#AB0000%25Temper (Anyone)''': Bobbi Jo is a spitfire, it's just the plain honest to god truth. Her temper is a quick hot burn, over almost as fast as it starts, but while she's angry...she's dangerous. %0a*'''%25color=#AB0000%25''Legitimate'' Business Owner (Anyone)''': Bobbi Jo has recently purchased a building for a club - more specifically a Burlesque Club.

Of late, that sadness has shifted to anger.%0a*'''%25color=#AB0000%25Bone Shadow (Wolves)''': She sure took her time, but rumor has it Bobbi Jo finally joined a tribe. Depending on your perspective it might be utterly surprising or completely typical, but she's done it. She, however, is not making a huge fuss of it.%0a*'''%25color=#AB0000%25Emissary to the Wise (Wolves, Mages)''': Asked to aid Charlie Caine while she was still alive, Bobbi Jo became her assistant, and in the time after her death, Bobbi Jo put to work all of her social skills to rise t the position.
