The way the light catches them is reminiscent of a stalking animal in the dead of the night, glowing with the moonlight before pouncing on its prey. She stands at about 5’8” with her head held high and a warm smile that sings of confidence.  Usually wearing a well-worn black jacket, with a broken zipper where her blouse is exposed almost always. Waves of burned cinnamon-brown locks frame her features that are almost the same color as her boots, making the mismatch of colors a bit more pleasing to the eyes.''%0a!!!%25werewolf%25Urhan%0aAt first glance, she looks like a strong and tall cinnamon highlighted Timber Wolf, that is untill her starkly colored eyes catch the light. Her very identifiable piercing eyes no longer hold the blooded tell they used to, but they're no less vibrant or a beautiful testament to her blood. Her fur is very soft as many newly changed Uratha's are, but the way she moves and stalks is more dangerous, a primal control over every muscle that makes it clear there is far more to this Timber Wolf than it meets the eye.%0a!!%25werewolf%25 Salt & Pepper%0aSalt and Pepper, twin wolf hybrids that [[https://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/index.php?n=Players.MarcusSkyShatteringRoarCrowley | Marcus Crowley]] and Celene adopted together. The use to be adorable pups have grown into adolescence, now out weighing and far out growing any dog of similar age. Salt belongs to Celene, aptly named for his attitude and beautiful nearly pure white fur with ice blue eyes.%0a%25center%25 http://i67.tinypic.com/34htgd4.png%0a	%0a----%0a%25center%25 http://i.imgur.com/2BdGROt.png %0a%0a(:table:)%0a(:cellnr width=50%25 align=left style='padding-left: 10px;':)%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=4px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=7px width=75%25http://i.imgur.com/4kUaKVc.jpg%0a[[https://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/?n=Players.MarcusSkyShatteringRoarCrowley|%25color=#FFE5B4%25''Marcus'']]\\%0a%25color=#FFFFFF%25My Mate, my producer, my confident, my hard headed Ensah destroyer.

The way the light catches them is reminiscent of a stalking animal in the dead of the night, glowing with the moonlight before pouncing on its prey. She stands at about 5’8” with her head held high and a warm smile that sings of confidence.  Usually wearing a well-worn black jacket, with a broken zipper where her blouse is exposed almost always. Waves of burned cinnamon-brown locks frame her features that are almost the same color as her boots, making the mismatch of colors a bit more pleasing to the eyes.''%0a%3c !!!%25werewolf%25Urhan%0a%3c At first glance, she looks like a strong and tall cinnamon highlighted Timber Wolf, that is untill her starkly colored eyes catch the light. Her very identifiable piercing eyes no longer hold the blooded tell they used to, but they're no less vibrant or a beautiful testament to her blood. Her fur is very soft as many newly changed Uratha's are, but the way she moves and stalks is more dangerous, a primal control over every muscle that makes it clear there is far more to this Timber Wolf than it meets the eye.%0a%3c !!%25werewolf%25 Salt & Pepper%0a%3c Salt and Pepper, twin wolf hybrids that [[https://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/index.php?n=Players.MarcusSkyShatteringRoarCrowley | Marcus Crowley]] and Celene adopted together.
