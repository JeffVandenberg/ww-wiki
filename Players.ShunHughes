The precise gender is difficult to tell, as Shun tends to prefer gender neutral clothing, or masculine. Even Shun's voice exists somewhere in the middle of the expected spectrum of each gender. Their height tends to reach at 5'7, with dark hair that is rather short, and practically cut, as well as simple dark makeup to enhance their blue eyes. A set of simple earrings dangle from their ears.%0a%0aTheir skin has taken on a colder touch and a corpse-like pallor, complete with dark circles beneath the eyes.%0aThey rarely show their teeth, though when they do, they haven taken on a more pointed look all around, and have grown translucent. %0a%0aWhen Shun remains perfectly still, one can almost see their shadow moving slightly, without them.%0a%0a----%0a!!%25center%25%25vampire%25Contacts%0a%0a||! %25mortal%25Image ||! %25mortal%25Name ||! %25mortal%25Relationship ||! %25mortal%25Comment ||! %25mortal%25Ringtone ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/keNckMm.jpg || %25mortal%25Apple McKinley || %25mortal%25Ally || %25mortal%25It's complicated.

The precise gender is difficult to tell, as Shun tends to prefer gender neutral clothing, or masculine. Eve Shun's voice exists somewhere in the expected spectrum of each gender. Their height tends to reach at 5'7, with dark hair that is rather short, and practically cut, as well as simple dark makeup to enhance their blue eyes. A set of simple earrings dangle from their ears.%0a%3c %0a%3c Shun's mannerisms tend to show a certain confidence in themselves, almost as if they feel the need to puff just slightly, with a straight back and slightly lifted chin. The particular look in Shun's eyes is almost uneasy calm at first, though there is a certain rage that exists there. %0a%3c %0a%3c Smirks are more common than smiles, and a light chuckle takes the place of laughs. %0a%3c %0a---%0a> %0a> %0a> %0a53,61c40%0a%3c %25werewolf%25 "Say something" [[]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %25vampire%25 "Say something [[]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %25mortal%25 "Say something  [[]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %25changeling%25 "Say something."
