It comes from a repurposed steal mill made into a commercial space then later hollowed out and turned into a dojo. The outside is bland grey brick with a small sign that say simply Kemono Dojo. When the doors open however a burst of floral scents great the nostrils. It is a well lit area primarily bright white with a clear Japanese motif. Rice paper wall dividers separate the administration areas and the sign in desk, where there is a fresh pot of tea brewing. The walls are lined with all sorts of Japanese weaponry and armor, as well as artistic murals and the Japanese flag. Most notably about the place are the several leafy pink plants around the room with shiny green beetles floating slowly through the air. The large open area in the center is covered in a white mat where Tokage sits kneeling with a katana over his lap%0a%25center%25%0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25beast%25'''Contacts'''%0a%0a||! %25beast%25Image ||! %25beast%25Name ||! %25beast%25Relationship ||! %25beast%25Comment ||! %25beast%25Ringtone ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/AsPSVr7.png || %25beast%25PC Name || %25beast%25Relationship to PC || %25beast%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25beast%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/AsPSVr7.png || %25beast%25PC Name || %25beast%25Relationship to PC || %25beast%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25beast%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/AsPSVr7.png || %25beast%25PC Name || %25beast%25Relationship to PC || %25beast%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25beast%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/AsPSVr7.png || %25beast%25PC Name || %25beast%25Relationship to PC || %25beast%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25beast%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/AsPSVr7.png || %25beast%25PC Name || %25beast%25Relationship to PC || %25beast%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25beast%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a----%0a%0a!!!!%25beast%25 ''Hook 1(Who it effects)'':%0a%0a!!!!%25beast%25 ''Hook 2(Who it effects)'':%0a%0a!!!!%25beast%25 ''Hook 3(Who it effects)'':%0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a(:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a%0a(:cellnr width=100%25:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25beast%25'''Quotes'''%0a%25changeling%25'''He's one of the most polite Begotten that I've ever met.
