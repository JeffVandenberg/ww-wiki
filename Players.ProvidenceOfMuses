They guide aspiring artists to greatness, demanding constant improvement in pursuit of sublimity of the arts. They hold up the philosophies of Plato as one of their guiding principles, promoting the idea of the Forms — the non-physical, perfected essence of every object or idea in the world. It is the artist's purpose to find the Form of their work, the quintessential representation of the subject in their art; a rose more perfect than any other rose; a song more melodious than any other song; passion more intense than any other passion; or hatred more caustic than any other hatred. The Muses inspire this perfection, they demand it, finding the potential that exists in budding artists and raising it out of the stifling shallows of mediocracy.%0a%0aBut in this world, the pursuit of perfection in art is a meaningless purpose in itself unless that very art is held up as the shining example for others to follow. The Muses seek to exert influence over Miami's cultural life, and in order to do so they need a platform for their voice to be heard. And so they sought the company of the distinguished and refined in society, those with a palate and and an appreciation for quality in the artistic pursuits, inviting them into their fold. It is a powerful union, the creators and their patrons, determined to make Miami the very center of art and culture in America and in the world. %0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a!!! %25mortal%25 '''Temple:'''%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=0px margin-right=0px width=420 margin-bottom=10px margin-left=10px border='2px solid #6e68a3' newwin%25 [[https://i.imgur.com/KVEDQnH.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/KTNCNwr.jpg]]%0aIn the basement of an unassuming building, a high, open arch leads into a marble-paved room, details of green and gold inserted into the polished floor to create elegant geometrical patterns. The room itself was high, two rows of sturdy furrowed pillars leaping from the floor all all the way up to the vaulted ceiling. It very much looks like a shrine plucked right out of the Classical era and then inserted into this Miami cellar, decorative marble statues lining the walls of the room. %0a%0aThey represent the Muses of ancient greek; Thalia, the joyous, Goddess of comedy; Melpomene, the melodious one, the creativity behind the Chorus, and then later, Tragedy; Erato, wreathed in myrtle and roses, the patron of lovers' art; and, naturally, all the others. There are additional sculptings of dryads, and satyrs, and all manner of mythological beings hailing from the very cradle of European civilization. Occasional alcoves opens up to the sides, leading into adjoining chambers suited for perfecting the arts, whatever artform that might be. At the very far side of the main room in the temple is the altar: a few raised steps leading up to an incredible fresco of the nine Muses, somehow even more detailed than the statues, more expressive, and evocative, their expressions and their forms so realistic it is almost breathtaking.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a!!! %25mortal%25 '''Methods:'''%0aThe Muses gather their supplicants in their temple for passionate rituals, rousing speeches and awe-inspiring ceremonies steeped in the magic of Contracts and other supernatural elements designed to remove the inhibitions and blocks that might stifle their followers' creativity. Truly, they are the living manifestations of Inspiration, reaching in deep into the artists and coaxing them to the very limits of their potential.%0a%0aApart from these mystical sacraments, the veteran members of the fellowship offer lessons to the new students, practical advice and guidance to further their talent. The patrons of the Muses make the proper introductions and phone calls to have their art exhibited at the right museums or galleries and they move in the circles that allow them to bring just the right people to a performance. It is a symbiosis that all benefit from; the student honing their skill under the guidance of the most distinguished teachers; the master having their art displayed and recognized throughout the city of Miami; the patrons impressing and astonishing their peers with their cultural distinction.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a!!! %25center%25%25mortal%25'''Cult Members'''%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a||!

Truly, they are the living manifestations of Inspiration, reaching in deep into the artists and coaxing them to the very limits of their potential.%0a%3c %0a%3c Apart from these mystical sacraments, the veteran members of the fellowship offer lessons to the new students, practical advice and guidance to further their talent. The patrons of the Muses make the proper introductions and phone calls to have their art exhibited at the right museums or galleries and they move in the circles that allow them to bring just the right people to a performance. It is a symbiosis that all benefit from; the student honing their skill under the guidance of the most distinguished teachers; the master having their art displayed and recognized throughout the city of Miami; the patrons impressing and astonishing their peers with their cultural distinction.%0a---%0a> Doctrine goes here.%0a
