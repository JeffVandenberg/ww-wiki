In fact on most days he's often mistaken to be female. Getting addressed as “her” is normal for him and while he was younger it used to upset him but these days he often laughs about it. It happens pretty much every day anyways. He stands at 5'10 and weighs roughly 135 pounds. Miles is slender in frame but quite athletic and has has a toned body. He takes care of himself and while hes not in the gym every day he always does parkour. His skin is soft and olive in completion and has short black hair. The most distinct feature about him is his eyes. He has vibrant white or silver colored eyes that seem to shine at night in the same way a wolf's eyes reflect off a flashlight. He also has a large bitemark on his left shoulder from a werewolf. The bite never truly healed and left a pretty nasty scar.%0a%0ahttps://i.imgur.com/f6fUbJ7.jpg%0ahttps://i.imgur.com/OnXNNXs.png%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25werewolf%25'''Contacts'''%0a%0a||! %25werewolf%25Image ||! %25werewolf%25Name ||! %25werewolf%25Relationship ||! %25werewolf%25Comment ||! %25werewolf%25Ringtone ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/BC0eaKc.png || %25werewolf%25PC Name || %25werewolf%25Relationship to PC || %25werewolf%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25werewolf%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/BC0eaKc.png || %25werewolf%25PC Name || %25werewolf%25Relationship to PC || %25werewolf%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25werewolf%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/BC0eaKc.png || %25werewolf%25PC Name || %25werewolf%25Relationship to PC || %25werewolf%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25werewolf%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/BC0eaKc.png || %25werewolf%25PC Name || %25werewolf%25Relationship to PC || %25werewolf%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25werewolf%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/BC0eaKc.png || %25werewolf%25PC Name || %25werewolf%25Relationship to PC || %25werewolf%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25werewolf%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25werewolf%25'''Hooks'''%0a%0a!!!!%25werewolf%25 ''Hook 1(Who it effects)''%0aHook info here%0a%0a!!!!%25werewolf%25 ''Hook 2(Who it effects)'': %0aHook info here%0a%0a!!!!%25werewolf%25 ''Hook 3(Who it effects)'': %0aHook info here%0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a(:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a%0a(:cellnr width=100%25:)%0a!!%25center%25%25werewolf%25'''Quotes'''%0a%0a%25mortal%25 "I am a quote!
