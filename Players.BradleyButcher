When he's off the job, he actually favors classic looks.  Button up shirts, slacks, jackets are his preference.  Jeans and t-shirts and uncommon but the situation dictates his look, often times.  He keeps his facial hair neat and his hair just as coiffed.  He looks as though he takes himself too seriously, carrying himself with a fairly straight demeanor but it hides a dry wit and cutting sense of humor.  %0a%0aTo those who can perceive the Meins of Changelings, his arms and back are covered in black Dragon scales%0a|| %25color=B60000%25Height:|| 6'3" || %25color=B60000%25Weight:|| 245 || %25color=B60000%25Complexion:|| Tan || %25color=B60000%25Hair Color:|| Dark Brown||%0a|| %25color=B60000%25Eye Color:|| Brown || %25color=B60000%25Date of Birth:|| 6/12/1989 || %25color=B60000%25Place of Birth:|| Portland || %25color=B60000%25Accent:|| None ||%0a|| %25color=B60000%25Build Type:|| Broad || %25color=B60000%25Scars:|| None || %25color=B60000%25Tattoos:|| None || %25color=B60000%25Piercings:|| None ||%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/EDKZbjp.png%0aBrad's a loyal friend and dedicated officer.

diff:1549164386:1549164117:=62d61%0a%3c *'''%25color=B60000%25War Machine (Lost Boys)''': Butcher's family name is a bit of a pun, it seems.  He's been heavily augmented and made into essentially a walking apocalypse.  The full extent of his abilities hasn't really been shown yet, apparently.  He often jokes that if you put your ear to his chest, you can hear him whirring.  %0a

When he's off the job, he actually favors classic looks.  Button up shirts, slacks, jackets are his preference.  Jeans and t-shirts and uncommon but the situation dictates his look, often times.  He keeps his facial hair neat and his hair just as coiffed.  He looks as though he takes himself too seriously, carrying himself with a fairly straight demeanor but it hides a dry wit and cutting sense of humor.  %0a%3c %0a%3c || %25color=B60000%25Height:|| 6'2" || %25color=B60000%25Weight:|| 225 || %25color=B60000%25Complexion:|| Info || %25color=B60000%25Hair Color:|| Dark Brown||%0a%3c || %25color=B60000%25Eye Color:|| Brown || %25color=B60000%25Date of Birth:|| 6/12/1989 || %25color=B60000%25Place of Birth:|| Portland || %25color=B60000%25Accent:|| None ||%0a%3c || %25color=B60000%25Build Type:|| Broad || %25color=B60000%25Scars:|| None || %25color=B60000%25Tattoos:|| None || %25color=B60000%25Piercings:|| None ||%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Bradley's description%0a> %0a> || %25color=B60000%25Height:|| Info || %25color=B60000%25Weight:|| Info || %25color=B60000%25Complexion:|| Info || %25color=B60000%25Hair Color:|| Info ||%0a> || %25color=B60000%25Eye Color:|| Info || %25color=B60000%25Date of Birth:|| Info || %25color=B60000%25Place of Birth:|| Portland || %25color=B60000%25Accent:|| Info ||%0a> || %25color=B60000%25Build Type:|| Info || %25color=B60000%25Scars:|| Info || %25color=B60000%25Tattoos:|| Info || %25color=B60000%25Piercings:|| Info ||%0a> %0a50c50%0a%3c Brad's a loyal friend and dedicated officer.
