He keeps his facial hair neat and his hair just as coiffed.  He looks as though he takes himself too seriously, carrying himself with a fairly straight demeanor but it hides a dry wit and cutting sense of humor.  %0a%0a|| %25color=B60000%25Height:|| 6'2" || %25color=B60000%25Weight:|| 225 || %25color=B60000%25Complexion:|| Tan || %25color=B60000%25Hair Color:|| Dark Brown||%0a|| %25color=B60000%25Eye Color:|| Brown || %25color=B60000%25Date of Birth:|| 6/12/1989 || %25color=B60000%25Place of Birth:|| Portland || %25color=B60000%25Accent:|| None ||%0a|| %25color=B60000%25Build Type:|| Broad || %25color=B60000%25Scars:|| None || %25color=B60000%25Tattoos:|| None || %25color=B60000%25Piercings:|| None ||%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/EDKZbjp.png%0aBrad's a loyal friend and dedicated officer.
