The young woman before you looks to be in her early to mid-twenties, standing about 5'9", with long runners legs, and she's built fit, toned and powerful lean muscle rippling beneath her skin. She's one of those women fortunate enough to maintain a natural, olive-skinned tan year-round, her skin tone almost that of coffee and cream, and her brunette hair is straight and shoulder-length. The real attention grabber, though, is in her eyes, drops of brown-hazel that almost seem to draw in the room, though something is off about them, as they almost seem to have a world-weary and haunted look to them. Her arms are sleeved in tattoos from wrist to shoulder, her left arm in Native American motifs, her right in a lot of Catholic-inspired, notably the Virgin Mary, crying two tears, though the other half of her face is replaced instead with that of a snarling wolf ripping free from the flesh of her face, the words 'Ave Luna' beneath it, and a date of '3/21/2020'. Her style tends toward very loose and free clothing, a lot of t-shirts and sleeveless tops, jeans of some type, and hiking boots.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25center%25%25werewolf%25''Urhan Appearance''%0a%3c %25center%25The Urhan form of the girl is a shadow torn from the night itself. Lean, sleek, and looking as powerful as a coiled spring, her fur is black, splashed with brown and silver down her spine, and silver up her chest and to her throat. Her eyes blaze, amber-colored and watchful.%0a---%0a> !!!!%25center%25%25werewolf%25''Hishu Apperance''%0a> %25center%25[Enter Here]%0a> %0a> !!!!%25center%25%25werewolf%25''Urhan Apperance''%0a> %25center%25[Enter Here]%0a
