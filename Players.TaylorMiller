She's the girl in the background of the coffee house. She's the woman next to you in the elevator. Always there but rarely noticed. Her hair is pulled back often in a ponytail. It's shoulder length and does nothing to attract or detour anyone from noticing her face. She's Caucasian with only a few freckles to define her appearance. But the freckles are not enough to draw attention to her in a crowd.%0a%0a----%0a!!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Contacts'''%0a%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/WCz0wps.jpg || %25mortal%25James McConnell || %25mortal%25Friend and Sometimes Boss || %25mortal%25I wish he'd see me || %25mortal%25Ringtone ||%0a|| %25thumb%25http://i67.tinypic.com/2u8udxu.jpg || %25mage%25[[CharlesDivianPeterson | Charles Peterson ]] || %25mortal%25Friend || %25mortal%25Boss || %25newwin%25[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZIummTz9mM|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i1.wp.com/blissread.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/itomboys-tomboy-brittenelle-fredericks-58.jpg || %25mage%25[[AutumnAionAverlane | Autumn]] || %25mortal%25Friend || %25mortal%25Earmuffs please || %25newwin%25[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCD5XCu6CM&index=29&list=PLgwqhB4wv9zUKFtOJp_V2VhcQctNHT9NP|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/JPuVgWZ.jpg || %25vampire%25[[Nathanial Hawkins | Nathaniel Hawkins]] || %25mortal%25Friend and Teacher || %25mortal%25Over and over again || %25newwin%25[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDl9ZMfj6aE&index=13&list=PLgwqhB4wv9zUKFtOJp_V2VhcQctNHT9NP|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Hooks'''%0a%0a!!!!%25mortal%25 ''What?
