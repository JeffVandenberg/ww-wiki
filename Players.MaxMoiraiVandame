The soft fluffy blanket in that horrid color you bought just because it was so soft, is suddenly a sanctuary in the form of bedding, the subtle raises of paint become brail to your fingers, every hair along a lovers arm is a delicate tickle in a path of exploration.  You know you shouldn't try and explain the sensation to them, but you can't help yourself, it's the delightfully reduced inhibitions of alcohol, or drugs, without the puking in the bathroom, or the white girl waste singing.  What's more, as you explain the words come easy, every attempt to express yourself comes easier, words, songs, art, that pinterest recipe you never could get right, for the rush of the nimbus and very essence of living in the now, you are rewarded with your creative endeavors being more fruitful.  Declare your affections, dance in the rain, break out in song, or finally get around to telling your old man how much his sacrifice meant for you, QUICK!

The hollow ache after a night laughing and drinking with friends when the house is empty.  The dent in the bed next to you, the sheets grown chill.

The soft fluffy blanket in that horrid color you bought just because it was so soft, is suddenly a sanctuary in the form of bedding, the subtle raises of paint become brail to your fingers, every hair along a lovers arm is a delicate tickle in a path of exploration.  You know you shouldn't try and explain the sensation to them, but you can't help yourself, it's the delightfully reduced inhibitions of alcohol, or drugs, without the puking in the bathroom, or the white girl waste singing.  What's more, as you explain the words come easy, every attempt to express yourself comes easier, words, songs, art, that pinterest recipe you never could get right, for the rush of the nimbus and very essence of living in the now, you are rewarded with your creative endeavors being more fruitful.  Declare your affections, dance in the rain, break out in song, or finally get around to telling your old man how much his sacrifice meant for you, QUICK!  Before the window closes!%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25 https://imgur.com/CjNPAtT.jpg%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Signature:'''%0a%3c Something is missing.  The hollow ache after a night laughing and drinking with friends when the house is empty.  The dent in the bed next to you, the sheets grown chill.  The low after the life of the party comes in like a force of nature, only to escape and take their frantic energy with him.  The Absence of...well....Max, of the here and now, of the abandon of the moment.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c %25center%25https://i.imgur.com/hNLiuHo.jpg%0a%3c %0a%3c !!Hooks: %0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center border='0px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=400px%25 https://i.imgur.com/Kpg0wI0.jpg%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!What's Cooking Good Looking%0a%3c Oh these Culinary Delights.  If you are a food network fan you've probably seen her.  Oh she's way to flaky to have her own show, but she's been a guest judge, she did Iron Chef that one time, and more than once she's dropped in on various celebrities live appearances to chirp the words "What ya makin'?" and sample their goodies in front of a live studio audience.  She is the queen of culinary hijinks and more than once people have tried to nail her down to her own show.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!World Traveler%0a%3c Been there, done that.  Max has seen the world.  Any place she's ever wanted to go, she's gone, and on more than one occasion, people have been brought along willing or not.  The pyramids?  Yes.  Great wall of China?  Absolutely.  The wonders of the world, the sandwich shop in New York, she'll traverse the world on a whim.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!The Great Masters%0a%3c Every Museum.  Every bit of architecture.  She has studied under the long dead masters, at least through their work.....but sometimes she talks about them like she's known them.  She doesn't share her art often but when she does it's clear she has talent.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center border='0px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=25px width=400px%25 https://i.imgur.com/CZRrTt8.jpg%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Polyglot%0a%3c Max has a knack for words!  She's pretty good at using them to get in and out of trouble, but more than that, so far there hasn't been a language she hasn't seemed to naturally take to.  If you ask her which languages she speaks, she'll just laugh.....and yet other times she's a brat who will pretend she only speaks French!%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Cut by the Fates%0a%3c The youngest of the Vandame sisters, and certainly the most...uh...rambunctious?  No matter how far she goes, literally or figuratively, she always finds her way home to them.  %0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c !!Gossip%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center border='0px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=300px%25 https://i.imgur.com/szfbYha.jpg%0a%3c %0a%3c "...They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old:%0a%3c Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.%0a%3c At the going down of the sun and in the morning%0a%3c We will remember them..." - Excerpt from "For the Fallen" By Robert Laurence Binyon%0a%3c %0a%3c "Drink some water, change your socks" - Marine Cure All%0a%3c %0a%3c "...And tell me now I'm much too proud%0a%3c To walk away from something when it's dead..."
