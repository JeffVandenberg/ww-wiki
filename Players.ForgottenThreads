There’s always some unfinished business, some incomplete task, some person, place or thing they want to protect. Something that they feel was supposed to be done already. This isn’t a coincidence. In most cases, they were fated to do that. To finish what they started, to remain with their family, to keep an eye on something they took responsibility for. But it was taken away from them, the thread snipped, cord cut, and weave disrupted by violence or negligence or selfishness. And cutting a thread like that, well, it tends to draw undesired attention…%0a----%0a%0a!!!'''%25beast%25Purpose''' \\%0a%0aOne of the most common causes of a ghost, and thus the shortening of Fate’s threads, is a death caused by violence or selfish negligence. When you kill someone when trying to take their money, work someone to death, or otherwise let your own selfishness or greed lead to someone else’s end, it ruptures their Destiny and a ghost is left behind as the frayed ends of their fortune scatter improperly.%0a%0aThe Forgotten Threads, then, are about fixing those frayed edges, but more importantly, they’re about preventing them from happening in the first place. They seek out those that take part in criminal activities or selfish gains that are likely to lead to such an end, and warn them against it, or strongarm them into stopping. Because if you cause too much damage to the weave of destiny, far worse creatures than a handful of cultists will take notice, and by then it’s too late for you.%0a----%0a%0a!!!'''%25beast%25Doctrine''' \\%0a%0aThe Doctrine is fairly simple; progress the group’s purpose, and avoid the type of behaviour the cult by its nature works against. Seek out those likely to cause ghosts formed of violence or negligence, and turn them away from that path. Seek out ghosts already formed of that, and help those entities that need to be directed to them find people that need to be “corrected” (or help do so yourself). Avoid murder, especially out of selfish motives. Avoid leading others to death in other ways for your own selfish ends. Avoid negligence leading towards the decay of others.%0a----%0a%0a!!!'''%25beast%25Temple''' \\%0a%0aLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
