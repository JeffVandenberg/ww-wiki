Her life saw many things: two world wars, a great depression, cold war paranoia, beatlemania, vietnam, and man touching space for the first time. None of those things though shaped the woman jennifer became like becoming a mother, becoming a widow (during that second world war), and then that daughter disappearing without a trace. The police were no help, but jennifer never gave up, and her search led her to darker and darker paths, and to the dark people that walk them. She learned their knowledge, gained their skills, and through the desparate promises she made in the dark places magic crept into her. Jennifer was not afraid to kill. It was a bleak time, war was growing in the hidden world, and this war spilled out into the mortal one more and more. Not only that, but it was an easy and opportunistic time for inhuman things to prey on the helpless when their normal rivals were not looking. It was against such things that led her to her fate, and jennifer would not be seen again on this earth for decades. Her daughter came home%0a%0a%25white%25Pawn was born in another world, another time, in a place your imagination fears it desires. A place where the trees seem to stare at your body and the starlight bathes you in intimate places. Pawn walked ground to the beat of hidden whispers and secret sighs. Pawn was born to a heart that craved subjugation, release from the pain of a life spent making hard choices. Pawn was dehumanized, brought low, but proud in her way. Pawn may have been a slave, but she was a victorious slave and her Queen the very best queen. She fought her battles with grace, she opened her doors before her, spoke her words to her subjects, robed and disrobed her mistress, and attended to her every wish. And she loved it%0a%0a%25white%25 there is Jennifer in Pawn, and Pawn in Jennifer, look into her eyes and you can see the other watching. They share the same clothes, and each is an essential piece to the identity of the woman, %0a%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a!%25white%25 Those People Closest:%0a%0a(:table:)%0a(:cellnr width=50%25 align=left style='padding-right: 10px;':)%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px width=175px%25https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/monster/images/b/be/Alicorn.jpg%0a%25white%25'''Aurora'''\\%0a%25white%25Partner, Sister in Arms, loyal steed.%0a%0a%25white%25Aurora the Alicorn was born of dreams in the far Other Place, she was born for a Queen, a Queen that was gracious enough to let a Pawn befriend her. They were fast friends, compatriots, rarely without the other. When Pawn rode out to herald her Queens commands, she did so on Aurora. When Pawn was allowed to spend a moment in the twilight alone, she stole it with Aurora. She was a piece of safety, a reminder of freedom, and when the time came to leave that place after so many decades, years, eras... she left it with Aurora. %0a(:tableend:)%0a%0a(:table:)%0a(:cellnr width=50%25 align=left style='padding-right: 10px;':)%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px width=175px%25[[https://youtu.be/DI90UFcMfjA|https://i.imgur.com/HSSPoxF.png]] %0a%25white%25'''Ryuko Saito'''\\%0a%25white%25Sister in servitude, Queen, Friend, Dear One%0a%0a%25white%25The pair of Saviaulta and Pawn shared existance in the Eldritch Forest kept by its Queen Sateen.

Her life saw many things: two world wars, a great depression, cold war paranoia, beatlemania, vietnam, and man touching space for the first time. None of those things though shaped the woman jennifer became like becoming a mother, becoming a widow (during that second world war), and then that daughter disappearing without a trace. The police were no help, but jennifer never gave up, and her search led her to darker and darker paths, and to the dark people that walk them. She learned their knowledge, gained their skills, and through the desparate promises she made in the dark places magic crept into her. Jennifer was not afraid to kill. It was a bleak time, war was growing in the hidden world, and this war spilled out into the mortal one more and more. Not only that, but it was an easy and opportunistic time for inhuman things to prey on the helpless when their normal rivals were not looking. It was against such things that led her to her fate, and jennifer would not be seen again on this earth for decades. Her daughter came home%0a%3c %0a%3c %25white%25Pawn was born in another world, another time, in a place your imagination fears it desires. A place where the trees seem to stare at your body and the starlight bathes you in intimate places. Pawn walked ground to the beat of hidden whispers and secret sighs. Pawn was born to a heart that craved subjugation, release from the pain of a life spent making hard choices. Pawn was dehumanized, brought low, but proud in her way. Pawn may have been a slave, but she was a victorious slave and her Queen the very best queen. She fought her battles with grace, she opened her doors before her, spoke her words to her subjects, robed and disrobed her mistress, and attended to her every wish. And she loved it%0a%3c %0a%3c %25white%25 there is Jennifer in Pawn, and Pawn in Jennifer, look into her eyes and you can see the other watching.

His hair is a curly mess. His visage a clear reflection of his mocking Soul. Dressed in the skin of the skater, jeans hug his legs and wheels dress his boots. LEDs run the seams of his favorite hoodie with its too many seams and zippers. While hands slide too easily into pockets, Technology is NiK’s domain and he wears its regalia proudly when he wears anything at all. A hand runs through his hair in consideration.

A head of slick dark hair sharply defines his straight forward attitude while he looks out on a world to which he mostly belongs. Calm and patient, his eyes are gentle and his smile easy. Dressed to impress, he dons high fashion in its many shades. It would be a simple gesture for him to click his heels as his feet settle next to each other or cross. A hand brushes his chin in consideration. His is Tomorrow and a firm handshake will bring everyone along for the ride.%0a> %0a> %25white%25The pair have the same even teeth and the same ghost of a beard.

When Pawn was allowed to spend a moment in the twilight alone, she stole it with Aurora.
