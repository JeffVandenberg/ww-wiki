Sponsored by and under the orders of the Consilium of San Francisco. San Francisco struggled to manage its Seers problems, and further north, Seattle’s Consilium was under a repeated onslaught of Banisher awakenings.. Portland’s Consilium was founded to assist both Seattle to the North and San Francisco to the South whenever they needed help.%0a%0a!!1938%0aThe Hierarch, Kit, is killed during a battle against Banishers. Dante is named the new Hierarch.  Under his leadership, subsequent Banisher attacks in the following years were suppressed and ultimately vanquished.%0aDante appoints Blitz to the position of Adamant Sage and charges him to explore the tunnels. Nothing is discovered and the explorations are ended.%0a%0a!!1940%0aBlitz and a small crew, sent to investigate near the coast, go missing. The Consiliums’ investigations find no evidence of a storm that may have washed the missing mages away, and attempts to scry their last known location prove ineffective.%0a%0a!!1955%0aDante pushes to send more magi to investigate the coast, but his plans are interrupted as the Seer’s set up a Pylon in Portland, opening San’s Occult Shop. The shop was inaccurately connected to the deaths of two teenagers and subsequently burned to the ground by locals.%0a%0a!!1955%0aThe Free Council is welcomed into the Portland Consilium with the agreement to stand against Banishers and Seers. Both enemies are run out of the city.%0a%0a!!1960%0aWar breaks out between the Vampires and Werewolves of Portland.%0a%0a!!1965%0aThough the Consilium had grown small in active membership, Dante and Provost Shiver choose to act to prevent the fighting from breaking into the mortal world. Two emissaries are sent to the warring factions to negotiate a cease fire - Thyrsus Fortuna  is sent to the Wolves, and Moros Shatter is sent to the Vampires. The emissaries are returned in body bags though details of their fate are unclear. This is considered a declaration of war. Dante personally seeks out each mage still known to the Consilium and presents two options: fight or die.%0aIt becomes known that there’s a 4th group involved in the war.%0a%0a!!1968%0aThe Vampires attempt an assault on the Consilum, however are repulsed by the combined magical might, with the Magi inflicting heavy casualties on the undead.%0a%0a!!1969%0aThe Provost Shiver discovers notes on the bodies of some killed vampires detailing the location of the Changeling Freehold, and some ‘evidence’ that they were behind some attacks on Consilium members.%0a%0a!!1972 %0aThe Provost Shiver leads a sortie against the Freehold. While extremely effective and causing the death of the pro-war leader of the Freehold, Shiver? lost her life in the assault. Dante?, on learning about the cost of the sortie, once again sees Pandemonium.%0a%0a!!1973%0aThe War reaches a conclusion with the founding of the Embassy to negotiate peace and forge an alliance between the remaining members of all four factions and introducing a fifth faction - Mortals possessing supernatural abilities or who had come to Know.%0a%0a!!1980 to 1993%0aPentacle and Seer war with the banishers. In the early 1990s Several staggered tactical strikes against the Pentacle mages of Portland left the consilum in ruin. Each order was hit and took heavy losses. The Seers gain majority control over Portland’s supernal landscape. While Banishers focus their attacks on the Pentacle until their resistance is almost nill. The Banishers turn their attention to the Seer’s in a blitzkrieg that nearly wiped them out. Pushed back against the wall the Pentacle and the Seer’s realized the wall was each other. Uniting their forces they are able to push the banishers out of the city.%0a%0a%0a!!1994 to 1997%0aThe Lex is rewritten to make an alliance with the Seers of the Throne. The decision wasn’t popular with many of the magi on a personal level, but Dante used the alliance to grow the numbers of Supernal allies that never really replenished in the decade after the war.%0a%0a!!1997 to 2000%0aThe Pentacle-Seer alliance fostered peace and allowed the Pentacle to take positions of power throughout the city. Some magi in the consili are know to site a familiar adage as it holds true, “keep your enemies closer”. The alliance additionally offered a passive protection from the Seers to keep them from outright destroying the Pentacle and a more active alliance versus their mutual enemy: the Banishers. But change takes time and this alliance is still viewed with caution today.%0a%0a!!2006%0aIn a bold turn of events during the summer of 2006 a massive Banisher raid on Portland pushed against the unified Pentacle Seer alliance. Unity won the day. Many magi, but still not all, began to accept the alliance over the years to follow. But a question lingers why are the Banishers targeting Portland?%0a
