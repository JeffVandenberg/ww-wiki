Territory%0a%0a'''Kenton''' - Kenton’s northern border is formed by North Portland Harbor, the channel of the Columbia River that separates the area from Hayden Island. Kenton’s eastern boundary is Interstate 5 and the neighborhood’s southern edge is defined by North Lombard Street. The western border (traveling from north to south, respectively) follows North Portland Road, North Columbia Boulevard, and North Chautauqua Boulevard.

The area is a marine community as it is located in the south channel of the Columbia River. Bridgeton residents, while in Oregon, are located just about halfway between Portland and Vancouver, Washington making dining and shopping that much more varied in terms of options. Commuting to both cities is quick and easy during off hours but northbound traffic on I-5 is often bottlenecked during rush hour.%0a%0a'''East Columbia''' - East Columbia is located between Sunderland, Bridgeton and Kenton neighborhoods in North Portland. As a result of the Portland real estate market boom and like many other Portland neighborhoods, East Columbia has seen an influx of new residents to the area.
