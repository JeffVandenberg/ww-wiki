The thick lashes of his eyes extend far, with beads of red on the tips. The brown iris he once had has taken on a deep red, and encompasses the entirety of his eye, with only the pupil existing where it ought to.%0a%0aIt's Andrew's mouth that holds most of the interest. Behind his lips rests a vibrant red mouth filled with jagged, sharp teeth. But leading from his bottom lip, down along his chin and towards his chest, there is a clear vertical line where the points of teeth seem to emerge, clasped closed, but still ever present. %0a%0aJust beneath the surface of his flesh, where veins, and muscle may hide, vines and roots seem to have taken hold. They snake, wind, weave, and bulge, pressing against the confines of the skin almost to its capacity. Where they seem able to tear, vivid crimson thorns slice through, growing in size as they appear nearest to joints.%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Mantle''%0a%0aHumid. Where others may seem warm and inviting, Andrew give off an oppressive heat, tainted with the feel of humidity; one might consider it analogous to a rain forest. Yet behind the sweltering heat lies the luscious scent of exotic flowers in full bloom, and the smell of rich, dense earth. %0a%0aIn his more emotional moments, the odor of rotting meat encompasses him.%0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''Contacts'''%0a%0a||! %25changeling%25Image ||! %25changeling%25Name ||! %25changeling%25Relationship ||! %25changeling%25Comment ||! %25changeling%25Ringtone ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/t2qnRla.jpg || %25changeling%25 [[Ascian Beng]] || %25Friend|| %25changeling%25Never have I met an individual with as much compassion. || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://imgur.com/XeoyhrM.jpg || %25changeling%25[[Adam Truman]] || %25changeling%25 Friend || %25changeling%25Interesting and adaptive || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QKxrTyx.jpg|| %25changeling%25[[Maricela DeSola]]|| %25changeling%25Friend|| %25changeling%25Enough energy to compensate for all of us.|| %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''Hooks'''%0a%0a!!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''Botanist(Everyone)'': %0aPrior to his durance, Andrew was a botanist, or a botanist in training.

He wears clean, crisp button ups with sleek  black vests, and a blue tie tucked behind it, held in place with a golden lapel. His trousers are of the slack variety, and a pair of black gloves are never far. When compelled, he sports a black newsboy hat. %0a%3c %0a%3c He has an olive complexion, with thick lashed eyes bearing a deep brown with flecks of reds and yellows. His teeth hold a bit of a point to them.%0a%3c %0a%3c Andrew just seems to wear clothing a bit more 'classical' and early 20th century. %0a%3c %0a---%0a> %25center%25[Enter Here] %0a> %0a58,64c53%0a%3c Dark hair has taken on a deep red and green, mimicking the texture and size of roots, rather than hair. %0a%3c %0a%3c Where Andrew was olive before, he is far greener, with yellows and brilliant greens accenting various parts of his skin. The thick lashes of his eyes extend far, with beads of red on the tips. The brown iris he once had has taken on a deep red, and encompasses the entirety of his eye, with only the pupil existing where it ought to.%0a%3c %0a%3c It's Andrew's mouth that holds most of the interest. Behind his lips rests a vibrant red mouth filled with jagged, sharp teeth. But leading from his bottom lip, down along his chin and towards his chest, there is a clear vertical line where the points of teeth seem to emerge, clasped closed, but still ever present. %0a%3c %0a%3c Just beneath the surface of his flesh, where veins, and muscle may hide, vines and roots seem to have taken hold. They snake, wind, weave, and bulge, pressing against the confines of the skin almost to its capacity. Where they seem able to tear, vivid crimson thorns slice through, growing in size as they appear nearest to joints.%0a---%0a> !!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Mantle''%0a
