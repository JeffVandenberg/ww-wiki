Finding it is a matter of hearing about it from someone else, which isn't difficult to do since word was seeded well by the club's employees, and given that it's not the typical sort of nightclub it's gained momentum rather quickly. A brick building greets people with a neon sign up near the third floor, promoting 'Night-Club' and 'Drinks' while under a row of lamps a simple 'Barbie's Burlesque Club' sign sits. Inside the door there's a pink neon sign that when turned on shows the Barbie logo. There are no bouncers outside which itself looks rather nondescript save on the nights when the line wraps around the corner.%0a%0a%0a(:tableend:) %0a%0a(:table valign=top:)%0a(:cellnr width=700 colspan=2 align=center:)%0a!! %25center%25%25color=#ff8ab1%25 First Floor%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=left border='2px solid #ff8ab1' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=25px margin-right=25px width=250px height=250px%25https://i.imgur.com/3EXMM5n.jpg%0aThe doorman sits beyond the front door inside what must be an old ticket booth, ready to take ID's - no one under the age of 21 is let in (within reason, obviously fake ID's, the merit barfly, and high social stats would allow for access otherwise). Those allowed in are offered a choice to pay a $20 cover charge or $950 for an annual membership to the club. %0a%0aFor those that pay just the cover charge the first floor is the only floor they have access to. Past the doorman, club goers push past a lush red velvet curtain, trimmed in the darkest black, and enter the main floor. Tables scatter the floor near the stage, small lamps on each to provide lighting beyond the low-light already present in the room. Along the walls are cushy red booths with slightly larger tables. The booths have a more private feel to them with a lower ceiling thanks to the second floor being directly over them. Stage lightning tends to make it difficult for those not near the booths to see who was in them.%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=left border='2px' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=25px margin-right=25px width=250px height=250px%25https://i.imgur.com/7FBX5mh.png%0aAlong the far wall near the stairs to the second floor was the bar, along with the bartender. Wait staff who take orders bring them here, but there is also seating directly at the bar itself for those who want to sit or wait for their own drinks.%0a%0aSamson, the first floor bouncer, sits near the door to the stairs just past the bar, ready to stop anyone that lacked the membership card (a black keycard with the hot pink Barbie Logo) from attempting to access the stairs. Given that the door is locked without the use of the keycard, Samson's main attention is on anyone on the first floor that tries to get too close to the dancers.%0a%0aThere are three restrooms down the hall from the entrance, one door marked 'Gentleman' one marked 'Ladies' and one marked 'Common'.%0a%0a*'''Membership grants the following:'''%0a**Private entrance to the club.%0a**Free drinks%0a**Access to the VIP sections of the club (both the second and third floors)%0a**Private shows with the dancers.%0a**A nightly list of the dancers for bidding purposes.%0a%0a(:tableend:)   %0a%0a(:table valign=top:)%0a(:cellnr rowspan=21 width=400 align=left:)%0a!! %25center%25%25color=#ff8ab1%25Dancers%0a%0a||! %25color=#ff8ab1%25Image ||! %25color=#ff8ab1%25Name ||! %25color=#ff8ab1%25Talents ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/28Imlyn.jpg || Lola || Singing, Dancing, Humor ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/HdfaQoR.jpg  || %25color=#ff8ab1%25Candi || %25color=#ff8ab1%25Slapstick, Dancing ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/pSsHyy1.jpg  || Jade || Singing, Humor, Dancing ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/fvDTahf.jpg || %25color=#ff8ab1%25Skye || %25color=#ff8ab1%25Quirky Humor, Dancing ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/ng0RRvh.jpg || Charity || Dancing, Slapstick, Innocence ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/q6KiNWg.jpg  || %25color=#ff8ab1%25Heaven || %25color=#ff8ab1%25Dancing, Singing, BDSM ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/dRrsMA8.jpg || Trixie || Acrobatics, Dancing, Singing ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/E0t0bMe.jpg  || %25color=#ff8ab1%25Desire || %25color=#ff8ab1%25Dancing, Singing, Humor, BDSM ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/R00ZYP5.jpg || Male Dancers || Magic Mike Numbers on Thirsty Thursdays and Ladies Nights ||%0a%0a!! %25center%25Staff%0a%0a||! %25color=#ff8ab1%25Image ||! %25color=#ff8ab1%25Name ||! %25color=#ff8ab1%25Position ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/MW57vWF.jpg || [[Players.BobbiJoKinslayerCaine|Barbie]] || Owner, Dancer, Singer ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/2DlMPs3.jpg || %25color=#ff8ab1%25Jory || %25color=#ff8ab1%25Head of Security/2nd floor Bouncer ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/yO5pZSM.jpg || Samson || 1st floor Bouncer ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/HL11C5d.jpg || %25color=#ff8ab1%25Melinda || %25color=#ff8ab1%25House Mom ||%0a%0a(:tableend:)   %0a%0a%0a(:table valign=top:)%0a(:cellnr width=700 colspan=2 align=center:)%0a!! %25center%25%25color=#ff8ab1%25 Second Floor%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=left border='2px solid #ff8ab1' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=25px margin-right=25px width=250px height=250px%25https://i.imgur.com/B5s7Xih.jpg%0aThe second floor is less of a floor and more of a balcony comprised of ten individual rooms for private members.

There are black velvet curtains, trimmed in red with the club logo direct center, that can be dropped for more...private meetings. However this is a strict $50 charge to have a curtain dropped.

Each dancer has a way of alerting security if a customer gets too rough, and customers who take advantage of the privacy of the dancer's room will find themselves on the wrong side of Barbie, and will not only be banned entry to the club, but likely met in an alley by a monster.

The room itself varies from the others in the club in that instead of being red and black, it's pink. The main area looks like any other office might, executive desk painted black with a hot pink executive chair across from two plush black leather chairs. Beyond that is a small bedroom, where Barbie herself occasionally sleeps. Only Barbie and Jory have the keycode to her office.%0a%0a(:tableend:)   %0a%0a(:include GameRef.Directorycity:)

Finding it is a matter of hearing about it from someone else, which isn't difficult to do since word was seeded well by the club's employees, and given that it's not the typical sort of nightclub it's gained momentum rather quickly. A brick building greets people with a neon sign up near the third floor, promoting 'Night-Club' and 'Drinks' while under a row of lamps a simple 'Barbie's Burlesque Club' sign sits. Inside the door there's a pink neon sign that when turned on shows the Barbie logo. There are no bouncers outside which itself looks rather nondescript save on the nights when the line wraps around the corner.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (:tableend:) %0a%3c %0a---%0a> !! %25center%25%25color=#ff8ab1%25Outside and First Floor%0a> %0a> %25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=250px height=250px%25https://i.imgur.com/3EXMM5n.jpg%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Those allowed in are offered a choice to pay a $20 cover charge or $950 for an annual membership to the club. %0a%3c %0a%3c For those that pay just the cover charge the first floor is the only floor they have access to. Past the doorman, club goers push past a lush red velvet curtain, trimmed in the darkest black, and enter the main floor. Tables scatter the floor near the stage, small lamps on each to provide lighting beyond the low-light already present in the room. Along the walls are cushy red booths with slightly larger tables. The booths have a more private feel to them with a lower ceiling thanks to the second floor being directly over them. Stage lightning tends to make it difficult for those not near the booths to see who was in them.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=left border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=250px height=250px%25https://i.imgur.com/7FBX5mh.png%0a%3c Along the far wall near the stairs to the second floor was the bar, along with the bartender. Wait staff who take orders bring them here, but there is also seating directly at the bar itself for those who want to sit or wait for their own drinks.%0a%3c %0a%3c Samson, the first floor bouncer, sits near the door to the stairs just past the bar, ready to stop anyone that lacked the membership card (a black keycard with the hot pink Barbie Logo) from attempting to access the stairs. Given that the door is locked without the use of the keycard, Samson's main attention is on anyone on the first floor that tries to get too close to the girls.%0a%3c %0a%3c There are three restrooms down the hall from the entrance, one door marked 'Gentleman' one marked 'Ladies' and one marked 'Common'.%0a%3c %0a%3c *'''Membership grants the following:'''%0a%3c **Private entrance to the club.%0a%3c **Free drinks%0a%3c **Access to the VIP sections of the club (both the second and third floors)%0a%3c **Private shows with the dancers.%0a%3c **A nightly list of the dancers for bidding purposes.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> !! %25center%25%25color=#ff8ab1%25 Second and Third Floors%0a> %0a> %25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=250px height=250px%25https://i.imgur.com/B5s7Xih.jpg%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Here they can watch the stage in private (or with up to 3 friends). This is where the dancers will meet with them for private shows and where the members can bid for even more private time with the dancers they like best. Each private room has it's own mini bar where members can make their drinks (or request the girls to) at no additional cost for themselves - and drinks at half price for any non-member friend they bring with them.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=left border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=250px height=250px%25https://i.imgur.com/7byTLfZ.jpg%0a%3c The rooms are not entirely private, however, as they open to the first floor, and can be seen into by other rooms. There are black velvet curtains, trimmed in red with the club logo direct center, that can be dropped for more...private meetings. However this is a strict $50 charge to have a curtain dropped. The best way to ensure full privacy is to buy one of the girls for a period of time and be taken by them to the third floor.%0a%3c %0a%3c Jory guards the door to the stairs to the third floor, and only with a completed bid card and a dancer with a key can someone get through to the third floor - or someone with a meeting with Barbie herself. Jory ensures that the girls on the second floor are respected by the customers. If a girl has to ask a customer twice to stop something, that customer will find themselves removed roughly. To the same end, Jory ensures no one gets to Barbie without her permission.%0a%3c %0a%3c (:tableend:)   %0a%3c %0a%3c (:table valign=top:)%0a%3c (:cellnr width=700 colspan=2 align=center:)%0a%3c !! %25center%25%25color=#ff8ab1%25 Third Floor and Barbie's Office%0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=left border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=250px height=250px%25https://i.imgur.com/16qdFug.png%0a%3c After bidding for time on a dancer, the customers are granted access to the third floor, by way of the dancer herself taking them through the door with a keycode only Jory, Barbie, and Melinda know. The customer is taken to the dancer's own private room - which while decorated to each dancer's own tastes (and talents) resemble hotel suites, complete with sitting rooms and private bathrooms. Each room is unlocked only by the dancer's own keypad code. Here in the room the dancer and customer will negotiate price and talent. Each dancer has a way of alerting security if a customer gets too rough, and customers who take advantage of the privacy of the dancer's room will find themselves on the wrong side of Barbie, and will not only be banned entry to the club, but likely met in an alley by a monster. Barbie will not stand for any unwanted damage done to her girls.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=left border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=250px height=250px%25https://i.imgur.com/vVIIDgJ.jpg%0a%3c Barbie's office is the only room on the third floor that isn't for member use, though members might visit her in it for various reasons. The room itself varies from the others in the club in that instead of being red and black, it's pink. The main area looks like any other office might, executive desk painted black with a hot pink executive chair across from two plush black leather chairs. Beyond that is a small bedroom, where Barbie herself occasionally sleeps.
