He is usually seen in a style of dress somewhere between 'biker' and 'business casual', in jeans, a black leather biker jacket over a comfortable long-sleeved shirt with black patrol boots. %0a%0aHis plate-armored Horror's gaze is no less intense, burning red light emanating from within its visored helm.%0a%0a%25beast%25'''History'''%0aTerrence Heide is the son of Ulysses and Lavinia Heide, two wealthy realtors with significant holdings throughout the east coast of the United States and Canada. He is the third of four children with one older brother and sister, and a younger sister. As such he is effectively a middle child and was often forgotten by his parents, living in the shadow of their achievements and those of his siblings. He is neither as athletic or as business-savvy as his older siblings and was completely overshadowed by the attention lavished on his younger sister, who was born when he was only four years old.%0a%0aAlthough he wanted nothing more than to earn his parents' approval, he never could seem to do anything that would keep their attention and while he was raised in the lap of luxury, he was utterly alone. Terry had been plagued by night terrors from the time he was a small child and after a disastrous attempt at going to college and majoring in business the nightmares only intensified, prompting him to finally pursue his own path, changing his path toward the mental health field and eventually deciding to become a psychiatrist, a path that his family once again largely ignore (Except for his younger sister, who admires him immensely).%0a%0aMedical school was difficult enough, as Terry lacked any great innate intellect or scholastic leaning and the nightmares grew steadily worse as the stress mounted, harrying him with vivid dreams of loss and defeat. It was only by sheer determination that Terry managed to make it through his education and then his residency and he had long since decided to move away from his native Virginia and head further south to Miami where he could finally escape his family name and practice his profession.%0a%0aAt first it seemed like the change of environment had done him good and his nightmares seemed to go away entirely for a time, but eventually they returned with a vengeance and finally one night the nightmare was clearer than it had ever been. No longer cloaked in symbolism and metaphor, the red-eyed armored figure appeared and began to systematically take everything he'd worked for. This time was different, though; this time, Terry didn't bother fighting. He threw the degrees, the expensive jewelry and the material things into the fire himself and it was then that he felt really satisfied with his life for the first time ever and embraced the Horror that would soon become a part of him.%0a%0aThe following year was one of learning and revelations as he learned about his new abilities and the true nature of the world, now feeding his Horror by taking from others, especially by defeating those who believed themselves to be powerful and taking their weapons and their pride for himself. During this time he had a failed relationship with a colleague; the relationship ended when he tried to reveal his true self to her and instead she was horrified and then returned later with others to kill him, his first encounter with what he would later learn were called Heroes and an encounter that cost him his a Chamber and nearly cost him his life as well. That hero and the three people who came with her to kill Terry are now corpses rotting in his Lair, their weapons added to the collection of defeated foes' weapons in the Lair.%0a%0aPreferred feeding method: Terry and his Horror prefer to feed by finding worthy opponents and engaging them in some kind of contest. Ideally this is a fight, but a game where something is wagered is also acceptable. If it is a fight they claim the loser's weapon or a token of their defeat - by force if necessary. If another type of contest, the item claimed must be something that is significant to the other person.%0a%0a%25center%25%0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25beast%25'''Contacts'''%0a%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/Imf41Pl.jpg || %25beast%25Eris Negate || %25beast%25Broodmate.

He is the third of four children with one older brother and sister, and a younger sister. As such he is effectively a middle child and was often forgotten by his parents, living in the shadow of their achievements and those of his siblings. He is neither as athletic or as business-savvy as his older siblings and was completely overshadowed by the attention lavished on his younger sister, who was burn when he was only four years old.%0a%3c %0a%3c Although he wanted nothing more than to earn his parents' approval, he never could seem to do anything that would keep their attention and while he was raised in the lap of luxury, he was utterly alone. Terry had been plagued by night terrors from the time he was a small child and after a disastrous attempt at going to college and majoring in business the nightmares only intensified, prompting him to finally pursue his own path, changing his path toward the mental health field and eventually deciding to become a psychiatrist, a path that his family once again largely ignore (Except for his younger sister, who admires him immensely).%0a%3c %0a%3c Medical school was difficult enough, as Terry lacked any great innate intellect or scholastic leaning and the nightmares grew steadily worse as the stress mounted, harrying him with vivid dreams of loss and defeat. It was only by sheer determination that Terry managed to make it through his education and then his residency and he had long since decided to move away from his native Virginia and head further south to Miami where he could finally escape his family name and practice his profession.%0a%3c %0a%3c At first it seemed like the change of environment had done him good and his nightmares seemed to go away entirely for a time, but eventually they returned with a vengeance and finally one night the nightmare was clearer than it had ever been. No longer cloaked in symbolism and metaphor, the red-eyed armored figure appeared and began to systematically take everything he'd worked for. This time was different, though; this time, Terry didn't bother fighting. He threw the degrees, the expensive jewelry and the material things into the fire himself and it was then that he felt really satisfied with his life for the first time ever and embraced the Horror that would soon become a part of him.%0a%3c %0a%3c The following year was one of learning and revelations as he learned about his new abilities and the true nature of the world, now feeding his Horror by taking from others, especially by defeating those who believed themselves to be powerful and taking their weapons and their pride for himself. During this time he had a failed relationship with a colleague; the relationship ended when he tried to reveal his true self to her and instead she was horrified and then returned later with others to kill him, his first encounter with what he would later learn were called Heroes and an encounter that cost him his a Chamber and nearly cost him his life as well. That hero and the three people who came with her to kill Terry are now corpses rotting in his Lair, their weapons added to the collection of defeated foes' weapons in the Lair.%0a%3c %0a%3c Preferred feeding method: Terry and his Horror prefer to feed by finding worthy opponents and engaging them in some kind of contest. Ideally this is a fight, but a game where something is wagered is also acceptable. If it is a fight they claim the loser's weapon or a token of their defeat - by force if necessary. If another type of contest, the item claimed must be something that is significant to the other person.%0a
