Because I g'damn said that's who I was, alright? And there ain't a damn sucker out there who's gonna correct me, you know why? Because I'm the Mad King. Every man, woman and everyone in between has it in them to be the same if they want. There's bigger and badder out there but they don't know something. They don't know that if they come for one of us, they come for us all. We've got the power to kill the Gods if they stand against us"''%0a%0aThe Horde of Courts is a collective of people who, in some way, know that there are great Supernatural threats and choose to come together for mutual protection. Leaders and Heroes are praised and built up from within, allowed to grow stronger and start Courts of their own with followers who grow in power and expand the ever growing Horde. Everything is done for the benefit of the collective and Individuality is celebrated even louder to keep the Horde from growing too stagnant.%0a%0a----%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''%25color=#8B1D0A%25Purpose''' \\%0a%0aFrom the Horde of the Courts rise Heroes. Heroes become Kings and Queens. Kings hold the strength and will to protect those who are weaker than them. As the Horde grows, so does the Great Hoard. The collection of knowledge, power and coin spill over and benefit all who grow its coffers. When something threatens even a piece of one King' Court? It threatens the entire Horde. No threat, earthly or supernatural, stands against the collected Courts of Kings and Queens and Tzars and Chiefs. The Strong protect the Weak, the Horde of Courts stand Together.%0a%0a----%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''%25color=#8B1D0A%25Relic''' \\%0a%0aThe Corsican Crown was once worn by the one and only Corsican King himself, Theodor Stephan Freiherr von Neuho. A German adventurer who declared himself the King of Corsica to free the island from the Tyranny of Genoa. Through cunning, guile and a whole lot of gunpowder. Where his attempt ultimately failed, it inspires those to know that the crown can be picked up by anyone who has the balls to put it on. And it's also a warning that if you put the crown on, you've got to have the balls to keep wearing it.%0a%0aThe crown itself is a simple thing that never was actually worn. Gold inlaid with dull jewels. It smells of gunpowder and smoke from the battles it was caught in. Killian found it at an auction by chance one day, seeing how special it was (and having a scent that made Boom-Boom just HAVE to have it), he added it to his personal Hoard before using it to start the Great Hoard of the Courts.%0a%0a----%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''%25color=#8B1D0A%25Doctrine''' \\%0a%0a1: '''Defend the Horde of Courts''': We are strong because we are united. No matter our differences, no matter problems? When a force threatens one of us, they threaten us all.%0a%0a2: '''Protect the Weak''': It is the duty of the Strong to watch over those weaker. That includes the ignorant masses who could be destroyed by the forces that threaten Us all. We stand against those who would subjugate and enslave.%0a%0a3: '''Contribute''': Our strength relies on the Horde of Courts pooling their resources to the Great Hoard. That could be currency, supplies, information, knowledge, housing, contacts, equipment, arms, skill or anything that can be used to grow and defend the Horde of Courts. If a Court has a need, the Horde provides.%0a%0a4: '''Trade For What You Need''': If you've contributed to the Great Hoard, you have earned the fruits of it. Everything is shared within the Horde. If you have a need for it, you trade with another member. They too, likely, have a need. When we pool our resources we become stronger than those who oppose us. You are expected to make the trade as fair for all parties as you can.%0a%0a5: '''Individual Freedom is Sacred''': No one's personal desires are more important than any other's. In the Horde of Courts, individuality must be preserved most of all. We are United but we are not a formless hive mind. Consent above all.%0a%0a6: '''Indulgence is Bonding''': The Horde's true purpose is to stand against threats that could destroy us all. Godlike, alien menaces. As such, every ounce of pleasure must be experienced in case that great battle does come. When an experience can be shared with a Courtmate or with the Horde itself, it brings us all closer together.%0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.75);' :)%0a----%0a!!%25center%25'''%25color=#8B1D0A%25Heroes Path'''\\%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''%25color=#8B1D0A%25Titles and Mechanics''' \\%0a%0a||!

Because I g'damn said that's who I was, alright? And there ain't a damn sucker out there who's gonna correct me, you know why? Because I'm the Mad King. Every man, woman and everyone in between has it in them to be the same if they want. Thereâ€™s bigger and badder out there but they donâ€™t know something. They donâ€™t know that if they come for one of us, they come for us all. Weâ€™ve got the power to kill the Gods if they stand against us"''%0a%3c %0a%3c The Horde of Courts is a collective of people who, in some way, know that there are great Supernatural threats and choose to come together for mutual protection. Leaders and Heroes are praised and built up from within, allowed to grow stronger and start Courts of their own with followers who grow in power and expand the ever growing Horde. Everything is done for the benefit of the collective and Individuality is celebrated even louder to keep the Horde from growing too stagnant.%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''%25color=#8B1D0A%25Purpose''' \\%0a%3c %0a%3c From the Horde of the Courts rise Heroes. Heroes become Kings and Queens. Kings hold the strength and will to protect those who are weaker than them. As the Horde grows, so does the Great Hoard. The collection of knowledge, power and coin spill over and benefit all who grow its coffers. When something threatens even a piece of one King' Court? It threatens the entire Horde. No threat, earthly or supernatural, stands against the collected Courts of Kings and Queens and Tzars and Chiefs. The Strong protect the Weak, the Horde of Courts stand Together.%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''%25color=#8B1D0A%25Relic''' \\%0a%3c %0a%3c The Corsican Crown was once worn by the one and only Corsican King himself, Theodor Stephan Freiherr von Neuho. A German adventurer who declared himself the King of Corsica to free the island from the Tyranny of Genoa. Through cunning, guile and a whole lot of gunpowder. Where his attempt ultimately failed, it inspires those to know that the crown can be picked up by anyone who has the balls to put it on. And it's also a warning that if you put the crown on, you've got to have the balls to keep wearing it.%0a%3c %0a%3c The crown itself is a simple thing that never was actually worn. Gold inlaid with dull jewels. It smells of gunpowder and smoke from the battles it was caught in. Killian found it at an auction by chance one day, seeing how special it was (and having a scent that made Boom-Boom just HAVE to have it), he added it to his personal Hoard before using it to start the Great Hoard of the Courts.%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''%25color=#8B1D0A%25Doctrine''' \\%0a%3c %0a%3c 1: '''Defend the Horde of Courts''': We are strong because we are united. No matter our differences, no matter problems? When a force threatens one of us, they threaten us all.%0a%3c %0a%3c 2: '''Protect the Weak''': It is the duty of the Strong to watch over those weaker. That includes the ignorant masses who could be destroyed by the forces that threaten Us all. We stand against those who would subjugate and enslave.%0a%3c %0a%3c 3: '''Contribute''': Our strength relies on the Horde of Courts pooling their resources to the Great Hoard. That could be currency, supplies, information, knowledge, housing, contacts, equipment, arms, skill or anything that can be used to grow and defend the Horde of Courts. If a Court has a need, the Horde provides.%0a%3c %0a%3c 4: '''Trade For What You Need''': If you've contributed to the Great Hoard, you have earned the fruits of it. Everything is shared within the Horde. If you have a need for it, you trade with another member. They too, likely, have a need. When we pool our resources we become stronger than those who oppose us. You are expected to make the trade as fair for all parties as you can.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5: '''Individual Freedom is Sacred''': No oneâ€™s personal desires are more important than any otherâ€™s. In the Horde of Courts, individuality must be preserved most of all. We are United but we are not a formless hive mind. Consent above all.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6: '''Indulgence is Bonding''': The Hordeâ€™s true purpose is to stand against threats that could destroy us all. Godlike, alien menaces. As such, every ounce of pleasure must be experienced in case that great battle does come. When an experience can be shared with a Courtmate or with the Horde itself, it brings us all closer together.%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c (:div2end:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.75);' :)%0a%3c ----%0a%3c !!%25center%25'''%25color=#8B1D0A%25Heroes Path'''\\%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''%25color=#8B1D0A%25Titles and Mechanics''' \\%0a%3c %0a%3c ||!
