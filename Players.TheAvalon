Daily, it takes regular cruises three miles out into the Atlantic allowing it to avoid the laws prohibiting casinos within city limits.  On weekends, it takes a long ten mile cruise out into the Gulf of Mexico.  Due to legal restrictions, IDs are checked prior to boarding and anyone under the age of 21 is denied entry.
