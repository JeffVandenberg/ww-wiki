The Garsi family lives in the district of Little Italy, New York, where one of Andrea's ancestors arrived at the beginning of the 1900's during the Italian emigrations. He was a mechanic, and the male family members of the following generations, Andrea's father and Andrea included, kept the family tradition.%0aAndrea lived there for most of his life, during which he learned repairing and modifying cars, and also become a street racing champion thanks to his mother, who was one too.
