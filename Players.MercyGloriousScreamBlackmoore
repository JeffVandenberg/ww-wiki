Almond shaped hazel eyes usually shine with either laughter or charm and she almost always wears a smile. Her clothing of choice is always for comfort rather then style and she seems more at home in a pair of old worn jeans and a button down then anything else. She has however been known to toss on some makeup and dress from time to time. He build is toned and clearly taken care of but not overly muscular leaving her with some softness to her curves. %0a> As a wolf Mercy is just as lovely if not more so. Sleek and clearly build for speed. Intelligent hazel eyes stare out at the world with open curiosity and a pelt covered in thick multicolored fur of dark and light brown seems feather soft to the touch as well as beautiful to the eyes.* %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> History:%0a> Mercy has just recently had her 23rd birthday and for the most part her life as been alot of moving around and a lot of crazy times best told over a stiff drink and some cheese fries. She was orphaned at the age of eight and found herself a ward of the state soon after with no real family steping forward. Lucky for her she ended up with two of the best foster siblings she could ever hope for. As an added bonus they both ended up being werewolves like her. She made it through school coasting on grades that let her pass along but found true passion in art. She was quickly known as the golden child with a pen, paint, hell anything she could get her hands on. All this ended up getting her a full ride to the New York Institute Of Art. Other then her foster siblings she wasent to keen on making long lasting friendships but she did keep up the polite pretty smiles. %0a> Making ends meet by doing contracted art work form gaming companies she had a lot of struggling before she finally made her brake out in the graphic novel industry. It didn’t take long before she had an entire series of novels out on the market and was finally out of the roman noodle and peanut butter life. %0a> Life took a bit of a turn for the crazy during her first change and to make matters even more crazy she ended up finding out about her siblings around the same time. The whole year following that first night of finding out who she was is still kinda a blur but she did learn soem valuable things. For one she got to meet her birth parents pack and lucky for her she did because they were the ones to clean up the rather large mess she made. %0a> %0a> %0a> Mercy is currently in Portland with her family and looking to settle down among the people while still trying to maintain a balance in her work life as well. She has recently started talks with producers about turning her novels into a TV series so she’s got a lot on her plate at the moment but loving every second of it. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Hooks:%0a> Calling all geeks!%0a> Mercy is very active in just about any convention she can get her way into. She has several horror graphic novels published and is known to do commission pieces for her fans at little or no cost. Maybe your a geek too?

Almond shaped hazel eyes usually shine with either laughter or charm and she almost always wears a smile. Her clothing of choice is always for comfort rather then style and she seems more at home in a pair of old worn jeans and a button down then anything else. She has however been known to toss on some makeup and dress from time to time. He build is toned and clearly taken care of but not overly muscular leaving her with some softness to her curves. %0a%3c As a wolf Mercy is just as lovely if not more so. Sleek and clearly build for speed. Intelligent hazel eyes stare out at the world with open curiosity and a pelt covered in thick multicolored fur of dark and light brown seems feather soft to the touch as well as beautiful to the eyes.* %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c History:%0a%3c Mercy has just recently had her 23rd birthday and for the most part her life as been alot of moving around and a lot of crazy times best told over a stiff drink and some cheese fries. She was orphaned at the age of eight and found herself a ward of the state soon after with no real family steping forward. Lucky for her she ended up with two of the best foster siblings she could ever hope for. As an added bonus they both ended up being werewolves like her. She made it through school coasting on grades that let her pass along but found true passion in art. She was quickly known as the golden child with a pen, paint, hell anything she could get her hands on. All this ended up getting her a full ride to the New York Institute Of Art. Other then her foster siblings she wasent to keen on making long lasting friendships but she did keep up the polite pretty smiles. %0a%3c Making ends meet by doing contracted art work form gaming companies she had a lot of struggling before she finally made her brake out in the graphic novel industry. It didn’t take long before she had an entire series of novels out on the market and was finally out of the roman noodle and peanut butter life. %0a%3c Life took a bit of a turn for the crazy during her first change and to make matters even more crazy she ended up finding out about her siblings around the same time. The whole year following that first night of finding out who she was is still kinda a blur but she did learn soem valuable things. For one she got to meet her birth parents pack and lucky for her she did because they were the ones to clean up the rather large mess she made. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Mercy is currently in Portland with her family and looking to settle down among the people while still trying to maintain a balance in her work life as well. She has recently started talks with producers about turning her novels into a TV series so she’s got a lot on her plate at the moment but loving every second of it. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hooks:%0a%3c Calling all geeks!%0a%3c Mercy is very active in just about any convention she can get her way into. She has several horror graphic novels published and is known to do commission pieces for her fans at little or no cost. Maybe your a geek too?
