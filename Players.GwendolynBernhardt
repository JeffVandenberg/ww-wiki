The most startling features are her bright blue eyes, they almost seem to be contacts because no one should have eyes that blue.  She seems to be in average physical shape, but its often hard to tell as she favors baggy tshirts, and hoodies along with blue jeans.  If she is doing anything strenuous she will always have on gloves and long sleeves and pants.  She seems to be shy about people touching her, often pulling away.  Those who get close to her, or who have supernatural sense of smell, notice a pleasent aroma coming from her.  It reminds people of a scent they adore and love.  It's inviting and almost addictive in nature. %0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25werewolf%25'''Contacts'''%0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25werewolf%25'''Family'''%0a||! %25werewolf%25Image ||! %25werewolf%25Name ||! %25werewolf%25Relationship ||! %25werewolf%25Comment ||! %25werewolf%25Ringtone ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/PuL9Pfj.jpg || %25werewolf%25Gabriel Bernhardt || %25werewolf%25Father || %25werewolf%25Though he no longer rungs with a pack, Gabe still sometimes helps out with Zenith.

The most startling features are her bright blue eyes, they almost seem to be contacts because no one should have eyes that blue.  She seems to be in average physical shape, but its often hard to tell as she favors baggy tshirts, and hoodies along with blue jeans.  If she is doing anything strenuous she will always have on gloves and long sleeves and pants.  She seems to be shy about people touching her, often pulling away.  Those who get close to her, or who have supernatural sense of smell, notice a pleasent aroma coming from her.  It reminds people of a scent they adore and love.  It's inviting and almost addictive in nature. %0a%3c %0a---%0a> %25center%25[Enter Here]%0a> %0a56c56%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/a692qRy.jpg || %25werewolf%25[[Roberto Luna]] || %25werewolf%25Best Friend || %25werewolf%25In Kindergarden, he announced we would be married.
