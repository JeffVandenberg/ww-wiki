He moves with precision rather than grace, and his posture is enviable. He often strikes others as trustworthy for reasons that they can't explain, and most people recognize him as an old soul. He tends to wear athletic garb- sweats, sneakers, and a tank top and/or sweatshirt depending on the weather- but not name brands, and almost always has a backpack.%0a%0aMien: To Fae eyes, Ace is a touch thinner and his enviable posture is completely perfect. He exudes a subtle aura of calm, command, and understanding that is hard to ignore. His garb is a remarkable charcoal and crimson military uniform in the style of 1800s Europe, though there is a tear at the left breast where his insignia would have been. His mien seems to lack dimension. Viewed askance or out of the corner of one's eye, he sometimes seems to lack depth entirely, as a jack or king on a playing card might.
