We are gonna get into soooo much trouble together, and I can’t wait!” - Trixie Reynard%0a‘just what every witch needs is a grimalkin familiar to guide their way. Blair is the best, and always there for me. I could be in love with her, and I probably need her more than anyone’ - Agatha Apocalypse%0a“I love Blair. When I first met her I thought she was interesting and fun but I had no idea how much she’d change my life for the better. She’s been a great teacher, wonderful friend, and a good person to talk with when I’m feeling off. She’s the best kitty cat! - Ryuko Saito%0a“Blair is the best cat I ever met. Part muse, part nightmare, I never know what I’m signing up for, other than that it’ll never be boring. - Donna%0a“She’s a cat, through and through, and apprently my wings make her want to attack them… She also speaks in tongues… But then again, she’s an oddball.” - Shadow%0a“When you think of a witch’s familiar, you think of someone loyal, affectionate, protective, but entirely sure they’re the one in charge. That fits Blair to a T. Either way, I’m not sure how I’d manage without her help.” - Daniel Renatus
