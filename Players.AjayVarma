His hair is thick and dark with soft waves that run through it when untamed.  He wears a beard, carefully maintained complete with a mustache that swoops slightly at each end.  His deep brown eyes are both intense, but with a hidden humor in their depths.  His body is lean and shaped with muscle in the fashion of someone who has had to be strong for a purpose as opposed to being sculpted for show.  He has a faint accent, almost British in origin when he speaks.%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25%25vampire%25''Bloodless''%0a%25center%25To those who see him without the Blush of life see a spectre of violence and death.  His skin is pale and sick looking, his skin clinging tightly to his gaunt form.  He is wiry and appears almost malnourished.

diff:1535941990:1535941396:=46,47c46,47%0a%3c %25center%25Ajay is a reasonably attractive man of Indian decent.  His hair is thick and dark with soft waves that run through it when untamed.  He wears a beard, carefully maintained complete with a mustache that swoops slightly at each end.  His deep brown eyes are both intense, but with a hidden humor in their depths.  His body is lean and shaped with muscle in the fashion of someone who has had to be strong for a purpose as opposed to being sculpted for show.  He has a faint accent, almost British in origin when he speaks.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> %25center%25[Enter Here]%0a> %0a49c49%0a%3c %25center%25To those who see him without the Blush of life see a spectre of violence and death.  His skin is pale and sick looking, his skin clinging tightly to his gaunt form.  He is wiry and appears almost malnourished.  His skin as receded back from his nails, almost like claws and his eyes go from a warm brown to a nearly black color%0a---%0a> %25center%25[Enter Here]%0a
