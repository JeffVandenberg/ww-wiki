Her detergent smells like sandalwood, and her hands like ink, and paper.%0a%0a!!!!%25color=db9d0b%25The Wolf%0aPax's Urhan form is the perfect likeness of the Firstborn Skolis-Ur, the Winter Wolf.

She's charismatic, poised, and cunning, with a visible preference for the finer things in life. %0a%3c %0a%3c Unflappably stoic and with the poker face of a sphinx, Pax stands just shy of six feet tall and is almost always dressed to kill, with a mane of cascading blonde hair and tawny colored eyes that always seem to glint at some unmentioned amusement.%0a%3c %0a%3c Her complexion is sun-soaked, tanned bronze from years in the Floridian sun, and she moves languorously, with the lazy confidence of a big cat, body long and lean and lithe, dripping a kind of animal magnetism.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=10px width=300 margin-right=20px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=10px newwin%25 [[https://imgur.com/odPUja4.gif|https://imgur.com/odPUja4.gif]]%0a%3c !!!!!%25color=db9d0b%25Scents%0a%3c She has an inordinately keen sense of smell, and as a result, she's somewhat particular about her own scent. %0a%3c %0a%3c Close enough or with enhanced senses, one could smell jasmine in her soap, and hair products that are reminiscent of coconut and papaya.

crisis management for a wide gamut of 'unusual' inhabitants of Miami. Put simply, she makes problems go away. She's charismatic, poised, and cunning, with a visible preference for the finer things in life. %0a%3c %0a%3c Unflappably stoic and with the poker face of a sphinx, Pax stands just shy of six feet tall and is almost always dressed to kill, with a mane of cascading blonde hair and tawny colored eyes that always seem to glint at some unmentioned amusement.%0a%3c %0a%3c Her complexion is sun-soaked, tanned bronze from years in the Floridian sun, and she moves languorously, with the lazy confidence of a big cat, body long and lean and lithe, dripping a kind of animal magnetism.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=10px width=300 margin-right=20px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=10px newwin%25 [[https://imgur.com/odPUja4.gif|https://imgur.com/odPUja4.gif]]%0a%3c !!!!!%25color=db9d0b%25Scents%0a%3c She has an inordinately keen sense of smell, and as a result, she's somewhat particular about her own scent. %0a%3c %0a%3c Close enough or with enhanced senses, one could smell jasmine in her soap, and hair products that are reminiscent of coconut and papaya. Her detergent smells like sandalwood, and her hands like ink, and paper.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25color=db9d0b%25The Wolf%0a%3c Pax's Urhan form is the perfect likeness of the Firstborn Skolis-Ur, the Winter Wolf. Her fur's shorter around the body but longer around the neck, and is as white as freshly fallen snow, glossy and thick, and two gleaming eyes glitter in familiar bright amber, the animal gaze both intelligent and watchful. %0a%3c %25center%25https://i.imgur.com/jARQ1qI.jpg%0a%3c %0a%3c (:tableend:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a%3c ----%0a%3c !!%25center%25%25color=db9d0b%25'''Known Details'''%0a%3c ----%0a%3c (:div2end:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 bgcolor=black:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:cellnr width=100%25 bgcolor=black:)%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=00px width=350 margin-right=10px margin-bottom=30px margin-left=10px newwin%25 [[https://imgur.com/QxVC2FW.gif|https://imgur.com/QxVC2FW.gif]]%0a%3c *She attended the University of Miami Law School, distinguishing herself enough to earn the coveted post of Editor-in-Chief of the UM Law Review while balancing a milieu of other organizational positions.%0a%3c %0a%3c *She interned at a prestigious crisis management and defense law firm while in law school, and worked there her first couple of years after passing the bar before she started her own legal practice. %0a%3c %0a%3c *[[https://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/City/PaxBungalow#toc6|Martini Pax]] recipe.%0a%3c %0a%3c ''[Note: This is IC knowledge available to anyone who looks her up or asks about her.]''%0a%3c (:tableend:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:div2end:)%0a%3c (:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a%3c ----%0a%3c !!%25center%25%25color=db9d0b%25'''Hooks'''%0a%3c ----%0a%3c (:div2end:)%0a%3c (:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 bgcolor=black:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:cellnr width=100%25 bgcolor=black:)%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=20px width=250 margin-right=20px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=10px newwin%25 [[https://i.imgur.com/JYIPBG9.gif|https://i.imgur.com/JYIPBG9.gif]]%0a%3c !!!!%25color=db9d0b%25 ''Call Your Attorney (Supernatural)''%0a%3c Pax provides legal services to those who can afford her exorbitant rates.

The office of [[https://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/City/PaxAssociates|Pax & Associates]] is in downtown Coral Gables off of Alhambra Circle. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25color=db9d0b%25 ''I Can Make This Go Away (Supernatural)''%0a%3c Pax is a fixer with a golden touch. Beyond strict legal representation, she's a devastatingly effective crisis management specialist and operational savant.
