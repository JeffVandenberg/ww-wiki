So she's known her way around her whole life. Adjusting to the way things are done in Miami doesn't seem too hard. Her tribe does specialize in humanoid prey but she's more likely to play shepherd than butcher among the herds. %0a%0a!!!!%25werewolf%25 ''Iron Master'': %0aLiving in the city, you can't just go all out with claws and fangs or the bodies will stand out. If you shoot them however, it's easier to cover your tracks to make sure the herd must not know. Plus we kinda have more overlap with prey than the other tribes. So many start with a human brain after all. LIta's an abysmal shot too for the record.%0a%0a!!!!%25werewolf%25 ''Rahu'': %0aHaving learned the hard way there are fights you can't win. Lita fights with a more defensive slant, working to avoid a hit or be able to take the hit on the chin. Even if it's just to get close enough to latch her paws onto something and slam them into a wall or onto the floor.%0a%0a!!!!%25werewolf%25 ''Ain't she a swole gal!'':%0aWith a degree in Physical Training and Therapy. She's qualified to train folks. But she is a mean task mistress. The real money though is in underground mixed martial arts. Lotta money making men squeak when limbs snap. How do you think she paid for college, stripping?%0a%0a!!!!%25werewolf%25 ''LGBT+'':%0aWhile werewolves can be rather gender fluid and able to express that. As far as the public is concerned, Lita has been out as trans since she was in college. %0a%0a!!!!%25werewolf%25 ''Party'':%0aDance for yourself first, then the ladies second. Take crap from no one, take your lumps, thump 'em right back. Puff, puff pass.

Dark blonde hair gets worn long and loose to her shoulders more often than not while the blue eyed woman looks around with facial features that would probably be described as farmer's daughter. She's definitely a healthy gal after all. %25r%25rWith the height, there's also a solidly built frame honed with lots of muscles. Which combined with a body that wants to be much curvier if she wasn't spending so much time in a gym stands out strikingly. %25r%25rHaving a body that's as much earned as it is blessed by genetic, Lita tends towards close fitting clothes. If she's not in a gym, there's band shirts, jackets and jeans gripping her muscles. In a gym, expect yoga pants, sports bras and little tops. And for special occasions; She can weaponize a little black dress. %25r%25rThat was six feet in height flat. Now add four inches of heels. Even the sneakers.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25center%25%25werewolf%25''Urhan Appearance''%0a%3c %25center%25A large, sandy furred wolf, with about three feet of height from fore paw to shoulder.

So she's known her way around her whole life. Adjusting to the way things are done in Miami doesn't seem too hard. Her tribe does specialize in humanoid prey but she's more likely to play shepherd than butcher among the herds. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25werewolf%25 ''Iron Master'': %0a%3c Living in the city, you can't just go all out with claws and fangs or the bodies will stand out. If you shoot them however, it's easier to cover your tracks to make sure the herd must not know. Plus we kinda have more overlap with prey than the other tribes. So many start with a human brain after all. LIta's an abysmal shot too for the record.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25werewolf%25 ''Rahu'': %0a%3c Having learned the hard way there are fights you can't win. Lita fights with a more defensive slant, working to avoid a hit or be able to take the hit on the chin. Even if it's just to get close enough to latch her paws onto something and slam them into a wall or onto the floor.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25werewolf%25 ''Ain't she a swole gal!'':%0a%3c With a degree in Physical Training and Therapy, along with human resources management. She's qualified to train folks. But she is a mean task mistress. The real money though is in underground mixed martial arts. Lotta money making men squeak when limbs snap. How do you think she paid for college, stripping?%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25werewolf%25 ''Party'':%0a%3c Dance for yourself first, then the ladies second. Take crap from no one, take your lumps, thump 'em right back. Puff, puff pass.
