Identify. Protect.%0a%0aThis is the Rose City Guild’s mission. Though the organization has its roots in the founding of Portland, the modern incarnation of the Guild came about during the War of the Four when professionals and businessmen came together with strategies to keep their communities safe from the supernatural menace. Through the 70s the Guild became more open to ‘Parapsychology’- psychic powers - and successfully recruited some of these people to help them protect humanity. When the war finally ended in 1980 The Rose City Guild was well established, well financed, and dedicated to keeping the city safe from the supernatural monsters of the city. They had also proven that the greatest powers one can have is organization, motivation, and knowledge.%0a%0aWhen the Embassy was founded the Guild forced their way into a seat at the table- much to the consternation of the other factions. This was accomplished through the Guild’s goal of Identification- they brought with them an entire binder full of names, pseudonyms, and photos of almost every single member of the newly formed Embassy. Knowledge, not petty supernatural tricks, was the power that carried the day for them.%0a%0aSince the war, the guild has only grown and been split into chapters formed around various professions with the over goal of protecting mortals and the covert goal of continuing Identify and preferably gain leverage over other supernaturals. Each chapter actively recruits mortals, psychics, and other minor talents that don’t fall under the other factions’ aegis.%0a%0aGuild Leader: Ambassador Madam Director Jennie Lewis%0a%0a(See Merit: Mystery Cult Initiation - Rose City Guild)%0a%0a[&#8593; back to top]%0a%0aRose City Health, Wellness, and Sleep Center%0aThe Health Center is a non-profit organization with a few different goals. First, they act as a charitable organization that focuses their recruitment efforts in the medical arena. As a non-profit they frequently go to schools to offer educational enrichment on health topics from sex ed to mental health education. They also run a free health facility that offers basic medical care, vaccinations, and even sleep studies.%0aGet Involved%0aMedical personnel are heavily recruited into the Health, Wellness, and Sleep Center. The Health Center is always desperate to for more volunteers to staff the center as well as more doctors to offer their own specialties to the underprivileged who come to them for help. The Health Center continually lobbies the local and state governments to improve healthcare access for everyone, and has several members of the government championing their cause. Similarly, the Health Center has many contacts in education all the way from elementary school teachers all the way up med school faculty that help the cause. The wealthy elite of the city are welcome additions to the Health Center as well- without their generous funding and lobbying aid, the Health Center never would have made it as far as it has.%0aThe Supernatural Side%0aBeneath the glossy surface, the Rose City Health, Wellness, and Sleep Center is one of the Guild’s best tools in its fight to help protect humanity from the other supernatural factions. Vampires are a serious threat that inevitably preys on the weakest of society and the Health Center offers a safe alternative. Vampires can come and receive blood for free. Bagged blood is always there but fresh may be available depending on who is present and whether any patients are suitable donors, or if any staff is willing to offer their own. Live donations are carefully monitored to prevent harm to the donor. %0aThe sleep studies side for Health Center is a newer addition that is trying to cater to changelings. The Guild has seen the results of mortals suffering from having their emotions harvested and is trying to find new ways to reduce its effects on mortals- or at least control the circumstances under which it happens so they can treat it. Sleep studies participants are also available for dreamwalkers to gain access to a dream, and the Health Center actively recruits changelings who might be able to help them heal individuals who are genuinely suffering from sleep disorders.%0aChapter Head: Madam Director Frank Martin%0a%0a[&#8593; back to top]%0a%0aRose City Neighborhood Watch%0aThe Rose City Neighborhood Watch began as an umbrella organization that helped local communities organize their own neighborhood watch programs, reached out to the police to try and improve community relations, and lobbied for better protections of mortal communities- and coincidentally for policies like curfews that made mundane life more difficult for supernaturals. Today the anti-supernatural policies have dropped from their overt lobbying agenda but the Neighborhood Watch has contacts spread throughout much of the city and they are well aware of what’s going on in any given neighborhood.%0a%0aGet Involved%0aThe Neighborhood Watch casts a wide net for recruitment. The most obvious are members of the local government, police, and EMS communities that act as first responders. Members of the media who can make or break a local news story are also powerful allies for the Neighborhood Watch. Meanwhile, the ‘boots on the ground’ are the homeowners and businessmen with their associations, and even the criminal element. The Neighborhood Watch is more than willing to bring gang members and more organized criminal elements into the fold under the idea that crime is going to happen regardless and it’s better to control it than to fall victim to it. Lastly, any minor talents with the ability to detect the spiritual temperature of a neighborhood are prized recruits, and often hired to work for the Neighborhood Watch full time.%0aThe Supernatural Side%0aThe Neighborhood Watch performs most of its outreach to the werewolves of the city but it is not adverse to working with other supernaturals if the opportunity arises. If a pack claims a neighborhood, the Neighborhood Watch can make or break their claim as the mortals in the area decide to organize and report every suspicious action and first responders push to improve their response time to an area. On the other side of the coin, a pack that works with the Neighborhood Watch gains an ally in keeping the area safe from a variety of threats.%0a[&#8593; back to top]%0a%0aRose City Literary Society%0aKnowledge is power. The Literary Society operates as an informal collective of book dealers, palm readers, occult shops, and individual occultists. Whenever there’s a problem of a supernatural nature, the Literary Society with its Arcane Assistance program is there to help whether it’s research, exorcising a house of ghosts, or assisting in occult ceremonies. The Literary Society is often seen as a collection of new age charlatans but that doesn’t stop them from putting ads in the yellow pages, telephone poles, and fliers in shops.%0a%0aGet Involved%0aThe Literary Society primarily recruits amongst the minor talents that they find visiting the occult shops in the city. People with esoteric knowledge of all varieties are prized but the Literary Society has a few more ‘respected’ branches as well. They perform community outreach and education as a Wiccan group, and lobby in the community for greater acceptance of alternative lifestyles.%0aThe Supernatural Side%0aThe Literary Society offers its services to the larger supernatural community, specifically focusing on the Mages of Portland. Many of its members have minor talents and are thus sleepwalkers, and those members make themselves available to help in rituals as sleepwalkers are capable of holding a spell instead of the Mage spending an extra Reach to power it. The Literary Society also hoards whatever supernatural tombs they can get their hands on, before any other supernaturals have the chance to scour the bookstore shelves. As a result, if a supernatural as reached the extent of their own libraries’ resources, dealing with the Literary Society is their next best bet.%0a[&#8593; back to top]%0a%0aRose City Livery%0aRose City Livery is a properly registered and functional business. It operates as an private car service with a fleet of limos and high end cars for corporate and leisure travellers in Portland. Behind the scenes, the Livery service does more than simply drive customers from point A to B. They guarantee the security from point A to B no matter what, or who, is being transported. While most of their business is on the up and up, there are rumors of less savory elements taking full advantage of the services RCL offers.%0a%0aGet Involved%0aThe company needs all sorts but is primarily looking for talented drivers and security specialist. They recruit heavily from ex-police and military, criminals who are looking to go straight or who have special skills, and businessmen who are skilled at running a business in general. Rose City Livery also likes to bring EMS personnel into the company for ‘just in case’ scenarios.%0aThe Supernatural Side%0aOther factions of the Embassy are more than welcome to take full advantage of the services offered by Rose City Livery, the same as any private citizen. Other supernaturals are well aware that they offer protection services as well as transportation. What they probably are not aware of, however, is that the livery service primarily caters to humans who need protection from supernaturals. A vampire finds she has a taste for a particular family, only to have the entire family vanish in the course of a single day with no evidence left as to where they’ve gone? The livery service facilitated everything from procuring new identities to a new home.%0aChapter Head: Director George Evans [&#8593; back to top]%0a%0aRose City Entertainment Service%0aThere is a whole big world of weird out there in Portland and the Rose City Guild is in the thick of it. Sometimes after a long day all the people of Portland want to do is chat with a friend, have a good time, and maybe a little something more. Portlanders’ tastes are more refined, more focused, and in many cases the average bar or club just will not do.%0a-?For those who work hard, they must also play hard. These individuals often have selective preferences for their entertainment. They seek quality companions with the right connections to have the best time for their money. Not every part of the Rose City Guild is above board. Then again can it ever be?%0a%0aGet Involved%0aThere are many ways to get involved. The Rose City Entertainment Service is currently hiring security guards, medical professionals, ‘entertainers’, and suppliers. For our potential clients the Rose City Entertainment Service promises their entertainment services are safe, untainted, and healthy! Rose City Entertainment Service fee schedule is negotiable. Do not fear if you do not have an abundance of cash lying around. Rose City Entertainment Service understands, arrangements can be made.%0aThe Supernatural Side%0aThe Rose City Entertainment Services caters to supernaturals and enhanced mortals. The Rose City Guild has many chartered services. These services include but are not limited to Kindred Feeding, Lost Dream walking, Information Trading, Spell assistance, and more. Some supernatural and enhanced mortals may not want to go to a public location for said services. The Rose City Entertainment Service developed as clients requested these services in a more intimate setting.
