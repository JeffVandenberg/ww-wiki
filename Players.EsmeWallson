Healthy, cream colored skin and ocean blue eyes with a hint of danger lurking just beneath the surface. Every move she makes is with a purpose. Is she going to kiss you or kill you? It's a very legitimate question when Esme walks in the room. Her attire is fairly modern, though when she isn’t doing business she tends to dress a little rougher around the edges.\\%0a%0a%25color=#ff2626%25 Bloodless \\%0a%0aThe golden hair turns platinum and her skin turns paper white. Those ocean blue eyes fade into an eerie, bright yellow - the sense of the Monster within certainly coming more to the forefront in that mesmerizing gaze. That foreboding feeling seems to increase as well when those eerie eyes turn on you.\\%0a%0a%25color=#ff2626%25 The Tattoos \\%0a%0a1984 - [[https://i.pinimg.com/736x/e4/6e/00/e46e00b962fb73cd2390e4443a6df400.jpg|The Lace]] - Starting on Esme’s right shoulder and wrapping around down to the left side of her waist.%0a%0a9/2/17 - [[http://i64.tinypic.com/2i6m650.jpg|The Record]] - On Esme’s left thigh.

Half of it is actually made out of a quote that reads “No matter how many times we burst into flames, we can always rise from the ashes.”. If one looks close enough they can just barely make out an ‘HW’ going through a majority of the piece, as if it was underneath the tattoo.%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=17px margin-right=16px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=8px width=315 newwin%25http://i65.tinypic.com/15y7j9g.jpg\\%0a%0a%0a!%25vampire%25 Personality:\\%0a%0a%25color=#ff2626%25 The Beauty  \\%0a%0aEsme is cool and collected, and much easier going in some groups than she used to be. She knows when to be polite, when to hold her tongue. She could be your best friend, or your worst enemy. It really just depends on who you are and what you do. She will show respect where it is due but will not go out of her way to bow at anyone’s feet. Respect, like trust, is earned and she does not give it out lightly.\\%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=17px margin-right=16px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=8px width=315 newwin%25http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/33800000/Taylor-Momsen-the-pretty-reckless-33865275-236-312.png\\%0a%0a%25color=#ff2626%25 The Beast \\%0a%0aVery rarely does the danger lurking in Esme’s eyes ever come full frontal but when it does - beware. When the Ventrue leans more towards the beast within is when the real Monster starts to show. She is calculating, vindictive, manipulative. She’ll kiss you while she’s stabbing you in the back. Nothing and no one will stand in her way when she sets her mind to something. %0a%0a!%25vampire%25 History:\\%0a%0aEsme is not open about her history because frankly it’s none of your business. She blends in fairly well with her environment so to an unobservant eye she seems to belong. However a keen observer may notice some of her mannerisms and speech seem a little dated.%0a%0a!%25vampire%25 Current -Notable- Events:\\%0a%0a*Was appointed Commissioner of Portland for the Invictus%0a*Began associating heavily with members of the Carthian Movement%0a*Has opened up a casino known as The Crimson Crown%0a*Was appointed Emissary to the Lost - a position she was unprepared for%0a*Her ghoul, Whitney, disappeared without a trace.

If you think you have a good idea, feel free to get in contact and set up a meeting.\\%0a%0a%25vampire%25 Just A Few Bucks (Everyone) - %25white%25 Need some quick cash? Don’t want to hassle with the banks? Ask the right people and they’ll point you in Esme’s direction. She’s more than happy to help out a person in a desperate situation and her interest rates aren’t too bad.\\%0a%0a%25vampire%25 Under The Table (Criminal) - %25white%25One the flip side of looking for legitimate and legal investments - Esme is always looking for opportunities that may not be so on the up and up. Power and Money are her loves and if you have a potential gig that could get her either - Esme is all ears.\\%0a%0a%25vampire%25 The Monster Within (Vampire)- %25white%25Esme is known for being fairly no nonsense and quite selfish and self-serving among the Kindred. Her sire is certainly not a good man and she easily followed in those footsteps. Perhaps you’ve had a run in with her in the past, or maybe you’re just looking for trouble. ((PM if interested in having some kind of past ties with Esme!))\\%0a%0a%25vampire%25Long Live Rock (Everyone)-%25white%25 Esme was involved with the music business in an administratively financial sort of fashion from the late 1960s to the mid 1990s. Music is one of the few things she enjoys and while her preferences ere on the side of classic rock, she will listen to near anything once. She is always appreciative of musical talent and enjoys talking about the subject.\\%0a%0a%25vampire%25Lost Girl (Changeling/Vampire/Embassy) - %25white%25In an unexpected turn of events for Esme, she has been named Emissary to the Lost of Portland. She knows next to nothing about Lost society so is going to be trying her best to learn what she can as quickly as she can, from whomever is willing to talk to her about it.\\%0a%0a%25vampire%25We The People(Vampire/Movement)- %25white%25Esme has been with the Movement for only a short time but has already thrown herself into the deep end. She has taken on the role of Harpy and is always keep an eye out for those who might be a good fit for the covenants, as well as opportunities to climb the ladder. \\%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a!%25vampire%25 Little Black Book%0a(:cellnr width=50%25 align=left style='padding-left: 10px;':)%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=4px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=0px width=100%25 http://i68.tinypic.com/28qynte.jpg%0a%25vampire%25 '''[[HarveyWallson|%25color=ff2626%25Harvey Wallson]]''' \\%0a%25vampire%25[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_XgQhMPeEQ|My Downtown Man]]\\%0a%0aIn any other city, they never would have had a chance to put differences aside.

Nonetheless, Esme’s come to view Lorelei as a daughter. She tries to teach Lore what she can, even though sometimes it might not come across right. While Lore is flourishing, Esme worries just a little too much. Worrying is half the job of being a parent, isn’t it?\\%0a%0a(:cellnr width=50%25 align=left style='padding-right: 10px;':)%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=4px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=7px width=100%25 https://i.skyrock.net/5227/91005227/pics/3263289118_1_5_2Q3T9m6G.jpg%0a%25vampire%25 '''[[DrVictoriaFrank|%25color=ff2626%25Dr Victoria Frank]]''' \\%0a%25vampire%25 The Friendly Doktor\\%0a%0aFrankie was one of the first people that Esme befriended in Portland.

Healthy, cream colored skin and ocean blue eyes with a hint of danger lurking just beneath the surface. Every move she makes is with a purpose. Is she going to kiss you or kill you? It's a very legitimate question when Esme walks in the room. Her attire is fairly modern, though when she isn’t doing business she tends to dress a little rougher around the edges.\\%0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#ff2626%25 Bloodless \\%0a%3c %0a%3c The golden hair turns platinum and her skin turns paper white. Those ocean blue eyes fade into an eerie, bright yellow - the sense of the Monster within certainly coming more to the forefront in that mesmerizing gaze. That foreboding feeling seems to increase as well when those eerie eyes turn on you.\\%0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#ff2626%25 The Tattoos \\%0a%3c %0a%3c 1984 - [[https://i.pinimg.com/736x/e4/6e/00/e46e00b962fb73cd2390e4443a6df400.jpg|The Lace]] - Starting on Esme’s right shoulder and wrapping around down to the left side of her waist.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9/2/17 - [[http://i64.tinypic.com/2i6m650.jpg|The Record]] - On Esme’s left thigh.

Half of it is actually made out of a quote that reads “No matter how many times we burst into flames, we can always rise from the ashes.”. If one looks close enough they can just barely make out an ‘HW’ going through a majority of the piece, as if it was underneath the tattoo.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=17px margin-right=16px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=8px width=315 newwin%25http://files.sharenator.com/taylor-momsen-cindy-lou-who-and-rockstar-the-pretty-reckless-s500x735-443257.jpg\\%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !%25vampire%25 Personality:\\%0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#ff2626%25 The Beauty  \\%0a%3c %0a%3c Esme is cool and collected, and much easier going in some groups than she used to be. She knows when to be polite, when to hold her tongue. She could be your best friend, or your worst enemy. It really just depends on who you are and what you do. She will show respect where it is due but will not go out of her way to bow at anyone’s feet. Respect, like trust, is earned and she does not give it out lightly.\\%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=17px margin-right=16px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=8px width=315 newwin%25http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/33800000/Taylor-Momsen-the-pretty-reckless-33865275-236-312.png\\%0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#ff2626%25 The Beast \\%0a%3c %0a%3c Very rarely does the danger lurking in Esme’s eyes ever come full frontal but when it does - beware. When the Ventrue leans more towards the beast within is when the real Monster starts to show. She is calculating, vindictive, manipulative. She’ll kiss you while she’s stabbing you in the back. Nothing and no one will stand in her way when she sets her mind to something. %0a%3c %0a%3c !%25vampire%25 History:\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Esme is not open about her history because frankly it’s none of your business. She blends in fairly well with her environment so to an unobservant eye she seems to belong. However a keen observer may notice some of her mannerisms and speech seem a little dated.%0a%3c %0a%3c !%25vampire%25 Current -Notable- Events:\\%0a%3c %0a%3c *Was appointed Commissioner of Portland for the Invictus%0a%3c *Began associating heavily with members of the Carthian Movement%0a%3c *Has opened up a casino known as The Crimson Crown%0a%3c *Was appointed Emissary to the Lost - a position she was unprepared for%0a%3c *Her ghoul, Whitney, disappeared without a trace.

If you think you have a good idea, feel free to get in contact and set up a meeting.\\%0a%3c %0a%3c %25vampire%25 Just A Few Bucks (Everyone) - %25white%25 Need some quick cash? Don’t want to hassle with the banks? Ask the right people and they’ll point you in Esme’s direction. She’s more than happy to help out a person in a desperate situation and her interest rates aren’t too bad.\\%0a%3c %0a%3c %25vampire%25 Under The Table (Criminal) - %25white%25One the flip side of looking for legitimate and legal investments - Esme is always looking for opportunities that may not be so on the up and up. Power and Money are her loves and if you have a potential gig that could get her either - Esme is all ears.\\%0a%3c %0a%3c %25vampire%25 The Monster Within (Vampire)- %25white%25Esme is known for being fairly no nonsense and quite selfish and self-serving among the Kindred. Her sire is certainly not a good man and she easily followed in those footsteps. Perhaps you’ve had a run in with her in the past, or maybe you’re just looking for trouble. ((PM if interested in having some kind of past ties with Esme!))\\%0a%3c %0a%3c %25vampire%25Long Live Rock (Everyone)-%25white%25 Esme was involved with the music business in an administratively financial sort of fashion from the late 1960s to the mid 1990s. Music is one of the few things she enjoys and while her preferences ere on the side of classic rock, she will listen to near anything once. She is always appreciative of musical talent and enjoys talking about the subject.\\%0a%3c %0a%3c %25vampire%25Lost Girl (Changeling/Vampire/Embassy) - %25white%25In an unexpected turn of events for Esme, she has been named Emissary to the Lost of Portland. She knows next to nothing about Lost society so is going to be trying her best to learn what she can as quickly as she can, from whomever is willing to talk to her about it.\\%0a%3c %0a%3c %25vampire%25Leap of Faith (Kindred)- %25white%25Perhaps it is not a great surprise, but it seems like Esme has finally made the leap. She has had a (thus far) clean break with the Estate and aligned herself with the Carthian Movement. There is even speculation that she is interested in taking up the Harpy position still open for them. \\%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !%25vampire%25 Little Black Book%0a%3c (:cellnr width=50%25 align=left style='padding-left: 10px;':)%0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=4px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=0px width=100%25 http://i68.tinypic.com/28qynte.jpg%0a%3c %25vampire%25 '''[[HarveyWallson|%25color=ff2626%25My Downtown Man]]''' \\%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c In any other city, they never would have had a chance to put differences aside. They wouldn’t have given each other a second look. Some people might not approve of their relationship but that’s because they’ve never felt a love like this.

Nonetheless, Esme’s come to view Lorelei as a daughter. She tries to teach Lore what she can, even though sometimes it might not come across right. While Lore is flourishing, Esme worries just a little too much. Worrying is half the job of being a parent, isn’t it?\\%0a%3c %0a%3c (:cellnr width=50%25 align=left style='padding-right: 10px;':)%0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=4px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=7px width=100%25 https://i.skyrock.net/5227/91005227/pics/3263289118_1_5_2Q3T9m6G.jpg%0a%3c %25vampire%25 '''[[DrVictoriaFrank|%25color=ff2626%25The Friendly Doktor]]''' \\%0a%3c %0a%3c Frankie was one of the first people that Esme befriended in Portland.

She feels an odd sort of kinship with Layla. They have a lot in common, even when it comes to their pasts. Esme is protective of Layla in the way that an big sister would be of their younger sister. She is curious to see how Layla’s life pans out - but rest assured Esme plans to be around to see it all through.\\%0a%3c %0a%3c (:cellnr width=50%25 align=left style='padding-right: 10px;':)%0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=4px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=7px width=100%25 http://i1287.photobucket.com/albums/a631/vintervalpen/Wanton%2520Wicked/Jennifer/unknown_zpscsrfz5kw.jpg%0a%3c %25vampire%25 '''[[NaomiGracen|%25color=ff2626%25My Friendly Competition]]''' \\%0a%3c %0a%3c It's nice to have a friendly rivalry.

She will be the death of me. That, I am sure of.” - [[LexingtonAdalwolf|Crusader Adalwolf]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %25red%25“Some definite similarities there, we both keep things close to the chest but dangle out just enough bait to get the other interested. Refined, polite, good company.” - [[DianaMartin|Notary Martin (Early on)]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %25red%25“We don’t agree on much. She is antagonistic and heartless, also Alder Wilkinson lords her station over others. This Kindred would be repugnant to all things living or dead, but at least Alder Wilkinson doesn’t bore me. I can’t say that about very many others I know in this city.” - [[JamesMendo|Jimbo]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %25red%25“Usually I can’t stand Vicks on principle, but she’s almost alright. She amuses me, she ain’t half bad to look at, she don’t have the usual ten food long stick up the ass that most Vicks have, and oh yeah, she’s got some damned good taste in tunes. Now if we could just get her politics right.” - [[Harvey Wallson]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %25werewolf%25“Well…You taught me some important info, and then…showed me a bit of myself and now?

We know things about the other now, I didn’t think possible. She’s not a monster, she’s more than the sum of her past experiences. She’s a fucking goddess.” [[AnastasiaWalker|Ms. Ana]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %25werewolf%25“Definitely not what I expected. In a city where most of the vampires keep their distance from me and my family, she had questions instead. Where others would put their guard up, she shrugged it off.

And yeah, she’s not a half bad dancer, either.” - [[MickMouthofPortlandWestbay|The Mouth of Portland]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %25red%25“I’m sure your interest rates are more than fair.

Enough of her own person to resist conforming into what people expect her to be. Don’t tell her this, but I respect that. I’m sure in another century or so, I might feel differently. But for now, she has my support.” - [[SamuelWalker|Primogen Walker]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %25blue%25“She taught me how to properly smoke, that was pretty cool I still can’t handle my cigarettes but at least she didnt make fun of me for turning green and coughing my brains out.
