Usually wears suits when he's on or just after teaching on campus. Otherwise, he prefers shorts and polo shirts with his ever-present satchel. Every once in a while, he wears the stereotypical explorer's outfit, from the wide brimmed hat, to the heavy duty khaki. Recently, a woman that could be his twin has been seen around town, sometimes even wearing some of the Doc's signature looks.%0a> %0a> %25center%25He has old monstrous looking bug bite scars on his chest, arms and legs. %0a> %0a> https://i.imgur.com/beGM6yQ.png%0a> !!!!%25center%25%25werewolf%25''Urhan Appearance''%0a> %25center%25 He is an Iberian wolf, with long white streaks across his face and black stripes on his forelegs. Most of the rest of him is a coppery mix of gray, black, and red. There are many old scars under his fur, including two bald spots on either side of his heart.%0a> %0a> %0a> %25center%25https://i.pinimg.com/originals/52/f4/df/52f4df39850fbe8a153a0a32325b63fa.jpg%0a>
