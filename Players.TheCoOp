The building, also referred to as The Co-Op, is a stone affair, and is kept well protected by the members of the Co-Op. The group’s members are all members of the supernatural community dedicated to working together towards their individual goals as well as towards the common good of the Co-Op. Members are expected not just to tolerate or be kind to one another, but to cooperate with and help each other. The general belief of the Co-Op’s members is that there is strength to be found in unity and diversity. It is not uncommon for members to help each other with projects, research, or job searches.%0a%0aThe building itself aids the Co-Op in it’s mission. The Co-Op benefits from its members living in a single building, thus reinforcing the close bonds formed between the members. Given the diverse needs of its membership, the Co-Op succeeds in large part due to the efforts of the mage and changeling who first struck a bargain in the creation of the building. The changeling and the Mastigos worked together to tie the building’s apartment doors to both the hedge and remote locations of the fallen world. While the actual details of the building’s creation are complex, the results are less so, although no less wondrous. The door to each member’s apartment, when opened with their key, leads to a living area best suited to their needs. For changelings this could be a hollow in the hedge, for a mage it could be a remote basement study with a small hallow, vampire’s rooms are almost universally havens away from any threat of sunlight, while some werewolves find forested dens guarding loci. Each ‘apartment’ is bounded by space magic, so that the only way in or out of the area is through the apartment door (although rarely the Hedge manages to shift a trod into the living area, such trods are almost always simply walking paths that loop back to the same living area). While not exactly common, it is neither rare for a minor spirit or an experiment-gone-awry to escape someone’s apartment and pass through the halls of the Co-Op. Usually the intruder is stopped my supernatural defenses, or else by other members. Such disruptions are minor, but keep things interesting in the day-to-day. Fortunately, the building also prevents pure mortals from noticing or remembering the odd goings-on in the main areas.%0a%0aAs members become more well-known and earn renown among their peers for their helpfulness to the other members, they often become a bit more entrenched in supernatural affairs, and it becomes necessary to either separate their mortal and supernatural identities, or else to strengthen their bond to their humanity so as to maintain the balance needed to live such a life with their morals and sanity intact. Eventually the most notable members manage to collect trinkets and items of power from their fellow Co-Op members, and even learn to activate those items with their own internal powers as they internalize some of the diversity of their group.%0a%0a----%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''%25color=#008080%25Purpose''' \\%0a%0aThe Co-op is a group dedicated to aiding one another to mutual benefit.
