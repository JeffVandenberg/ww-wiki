He has short, not-exactly-styled dirty blonde hair, eyes that don't seem quite right when not directly in the light, and a fairly average sort of build overall. He wears stylish enough clothing, usually polo or collared shirts with nice jeans or khakis, with strange occult odds and ends often hanging around his neck, off a belt, or peeking out of a pocket, glowing with magic to those that can sense such a thing.%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Inviting in the Dark''' %0aWhen channeling the power of the Dark One (with the aforementioned custom Style), he becomes a little unsettling. His eyes darken to the maximum "natural" extent a human's could end up, bloodshot and restless, and his skin becomes ghostly pale, his veins pressing against the surface. His hair browns a shade, and his nails seem sharper and deeper. When actually calling upon a supernatural power, his eyes flash black and strange whispers can be heard around him, echoing his own voice eerily. %0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=10px border='2px solid #111111' width=305 margin-right=0px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=10px newwin%25https://i.imgur.com/HRd4N6W.png%0a!!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Familiar'''%0aThose that can see into the spiritual phase of twilight might notice a fairly unnatural looking spirit following him around most days, a pool of inky shadows that occasionally "climbs" out of itself with four jagged claws, glowing eyes, and an angular body that constantly whirls and rearranges itself as the shadows pulse and move. It's about as big as a large person when so extended, or like a large black puddle when collapsed in on itself, but it's weightless and moves freely and unimpeded. %0a%0a%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a%0a----%0a!!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Hooks'''%0a----%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=10px border='2px solid #111111' width=305 margin-right=10px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=0px newwin%25https://i.imgur.com/aIl9t6T.jpg%0a!!!!%25mortal%25 ''Spirit Negotiator (Spirit-Focused Folks)'': %0aFor a mortal, Timothy's fairly adept at attracting and bargaining with spirits for minor favors, and even has a familiar. In an emergency, he can bind and command them, although it's far from a guarantee. He's even been in the Shadow itself, although never on his own. %0a%0a!!!!%25mortal%25 ''Archpriest (Cult)'': %0aRecently, he's progressed to the point of becoming an Archpriest of [[The Invisible Hand]]. He's keeping an eye out for those with a leaning towards the spiritual, to perhaps pass along an invitation. %0a%0a!!!!%25mortal%25 ''Occultist for hire (Anyone)'': %0aHe has a few listings as a parnormal investigator online, in occasional tabloid ads, and otherwise, and seems to just barely make enough to get by day to day. He's also not too shy about handing out his overly simple business cards. The work is often aimed at those that don't really know what's going on, but he's willing to look into more serious supernatural problems for those in the know, and perhaps even offer up his skill with magic.%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=10px border='2px solid #111111' width=305 margin-right=0px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=10px newwin%25https://i.imgur.com/lSxfOua.jpg%0a!!!!%25mortal%25 ''Forgotten Business (Business Sphere)'': %0aBriefly, Tim was considering going through business school, but before he could really get anywhere into it, his path started to divert to the more otherworldly. Still, perhaps you might know him from school.%0a%0a!!!!%25vampire%25 ''Vampiric Periphery (Vampire, obv)'': %0aTim's been finding himself at the edge of vampiric society, supposedly "thralled" by [[Lorelei McCowan]], but he's become curious as to other aspects of it, especially the supernatural powers of those within. He asks a lot of questions, although usually tends to be very careful to be quiet if it's clear someone doesn't like him prodding about too much. Usually. %0a%0a!!!!%25werewolf%25 ''Primeval Veil (Werewolf)'': %0aTim's recently joined a Pack. While it's very common for mortals to end up in them, what's not common is for them to be aware and full participants in their goings on, like he is. Apparently too, their Totem has blessed him with an immunity to Lunacy, even if he seems a little skittish around werewolves in general, as a result. %0a%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a----%0a!!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Charms and Trinkets'''%0a----%0a%0aAs mentioned above, often times Tim can be seen with a fair number of occult talismans, charms, amulets, and otherwise on his person. Many are decoration or minimal effect, but a few notable ones follow; all are enchanted, and thus actively appear magical.%0a%0a(:cellnr align=center style='background-color:#000000;' width=225:)[++Dark One's Ring++]%0a(:cell align=center style='background-color:#111111;' width=225:)[++Protective Amulet (Magic)++]%0a(:cell align=center style='background-color:#000000;' width=225:) [++Energy Meter (Loci)++]%0a(:cellnr align=center style='background-color:#000000;' width=225:) https://i.imgur.com/ElCa9BP.jpg %0a(:cell align=center style='background-color:#111111;' width=225:) https://i.imgur.com/MZdfuwE.jpg%0a(:cell align=center style='background-color:#000000;' width=225:) https://i.imgur.com/mUdls4K.jpg%0a(:cellnr align=center  style='background-color:#000000;' width=225:) On his ring finger.
