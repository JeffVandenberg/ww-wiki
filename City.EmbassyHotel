Teleportation can only get out of this if it’s capable of doing so through unknown realms, and requires a Clash as normal. Should someone end up in such a room, the Ambassadors will immediately become aware.%0a**Mundane hostile actions will cause the user to be shunted as soon as the hostility of it is ‘obvious’ to a theoretical neutral observer.

They’re often a combination of simple symbols, miscellaneous markings (claw scratches, for instance), or perhaps even little attached trinkets or forms of decoration.%0a%0aIn general, these are short messages, generally dictating who controls the area (Vampires, Werewolves, the Embassy), and if it’s meant to be solely for them or if it’s ‘Neutral Ground’, that is, open to anyone who follows the Embassy’s rules and those of the owner. Some other general ‘status’ markings have been developed recently, such as ‘Danger’ (meaning the location is a risk for anyone, but not necessarily barred), ‘Safe’ (meaning those within are usually willing to provide shelter or ‘sanctuary’ to those that ask), and similar descriptors.%0a%0aOf course, individual Factions have found ways to personalize their symbols a bit, to make it recognizable as belonging to a smaller group within the faction, but with the general Faction still recognizable to anyone else. For instance, many Werewolves will add a first tongue sigil into the design, representing the Tribe or Pack that controls the area specifically, whereas anyone else can still recognize it as being Werewolf controlled.%0a%0aTo note, use of this system is not required, in the case of those preferring to keep their holdings secret, but any misunderstandings caused by that must be lived with by the owner.%0a(:tableend:)   %0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a(:table valign=top:)%0a(:cellnr width=700 colspan=2 align=left:)%0a!!!Systems%0a%0aFor the most part, Seals are recognizable to anyone affiliated with or at least abiding by the Embassy without any rolls.

For instance, many Werewolves will add a first tongue sigil into the design, representing the Tribe or Pack that controls the area specifically, whereas anyone else can still recognize it as being Werewolf controlled.%0a%3c %0a%3c To note, use of this system is not required, in the case of those preferring to keep their holdings secret, but any misunderstandings caused by that must be lived with by the owner.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Systems%0a%3c %0a%3c For the most part, Seals are recognizable to anyone affiliated with or at least abiding by the Embassy without any rolls. Recognizing a sigil belonging to another faction as representing a sub-group may require a Wits + Politics, Streetwise, or Occult roll, in which case it’s recognizable as either belonging to a sub-faction (or pack-equivalent, or lineage, etc), or to those that have experience with them, it’s recognizable as that specific group.%0a%3c %0a%3c Location wikis should list the Embassy Seals, if any, that can be found in the area, and who can automatically recognize them (that is, those that don’t need a roll).
