Public Background%0a%0aThe Spider came to Portland at the tail of December in 2016, searching out the Lost community through a variety of rumor hoarding, foot work, and plain old luck. Its clear she’s not fresh from the Hedge by the way she throws about Lost lingo but she doesn’t say how long ago she was taken. Though she has a Californian accent, some can catch snatches of Arabic can be heard muttered beneath her breath when she’s particularly upset.%0a%0aShe’s spooked around the Embassy and often visits the Revolucion Coffee House wearing the colors of Spring. Vrys mentions being part of another Freehold down in California that collapsed due to infighting and the predations of the Hunters but won’t specify where and how long. She's currently the Changeling Emissary to the Uratha of Portland (Status 3) and one of the head recruiters of the Portland Fight Club (Status 5).%0a----%0a%0a!! Hooks%0a%0a*“Fight Club Trainer” (Combat Oriented, Portland Fight Club): Vrischika has a competitive streak and a love for down and dirty fights that she wears on her sleeve. She is also a member of the Portland Fight Club as an established member and personal trainer. If you’re the kind of person who wants to test themselves on the Spider, she’s more than willing to throw down. She likes to keep score and she savors the thrill of the fight, win or lose. The Spider doesn’t have a fight pad just yet but she’s definitely working on that; until then she’ll throwdown any place out of the way, to knockdown or first blood.%0a%0a*“Kin of Long Fangs” (Werewolves): The Spider is theappointed Emissary of the Three Pillar Freehold and is actively cultivating her bonds with the various People and Packs that live in Portland. If you’re a Werewolf, a Wolf-Blood, or an ally of them and have any matters to bring with the Fae of Portland, come to this Spider and she’ll do what she can to arbitrate your problems. She is especially interested in helping fight the Hosts and has assisted in hunts on both Azlu and Belishu%0a%0a*“Hunt the Hunters” (Changelings, Supernatural): Vrys hates the Huntsmen with an acid vitriol. She is a founding member of the Broken Hunt, a motley dedicated to further delay or even prevent the return of a Huntsman. They have defeated one such Huntsman, The Flautist, sent by Vrys' own Keeper to return a fleeing Changeling outside of the Freehold.%0a%0a*"Beasttongue" (Any): Vrys can talk to animals and command them with alarming potency. If you need pest control, animal research, or just want to make a new friend fuzzy, feathered, or otherwise, hit Vrys up.%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a%0a!! Quotes%0a%0a(:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5:)%0a%0a(:cellnr width=100%25:)%0a%0a%25mortal%25 “She’s certainly something. Some people seem scared of her, some love her. She has a raw, animal draw to her, but she’ll respect the boundaries.” - Norwood Dara Sterling. \\%0a%0a%25mortal%25 “Ya confuse me. But as time passes, Ah’m startin’ ta see more, ta undahstand. Ah’ll be here when ya need me. Whethah ta feed ya hungah, or ta feed mine, ya know where Ah am.” -Remy Darbonne. \\%0a%0a%25werewolf%25 “Do you know what they say about first impressions? By and large, the saying is true. They are devilish little things that can sour entire relationships before they even begin. I am glad, then, that Ms. Sarkhet has proven to be the exception to the rule.” -Archer "Legion" Cross \\%0a%0a%25werewolf%25 “I don’t do well with Spiders. She already knows why. That said, she seems to hate the Azlu as much as I do and she hasn’t given me a reason to distrust her.” -Butch -Banzai- McCullough. \\%0a%0a%25werewolf%25 "Don’t let her grab you, if you’re sparing. I don’t remember much after her grabbing me. Going to have to try to stick and move in the future. Great fighter.” -Amand -Bear- Raskoph \\%0a%0a%25werewolf%25 “Mind games always bloody lead t’ far more fun games, yeah? Especially in this case.” -Desmond King. \\%0a%0a%25changeling%25 “ I adore my spider. She has such determination and independence and the two of us have been through so much together. There’s a fierce warrior, vivid terror, and temptress on the outside but her heart is beautiful and caring past that chitinous armor. I can feel it when we look to each others eyes.” -Ryuko Saito. \\%0a%0a%25changeling%25 “I see a lot of raw,primal potential.I hate to admit,but with training,she may be greatest grappler i have ever met.my resentment is only surpassed by my admiration of this fact.”  -Ivan -The Terrible- Reznikov. \\%0a%0a%25mortal%25 "Nice butt wanna Wrestle?" [[Cranium| Doom Bot]] \\%0a%0a%25changeling%25 "The first time I fought the spider she broke my ribs.  Every time since we have gotten better but I have closed the gap.  She has helped me become accustomed to life outside and to be a better warrior.  For this I am grateful." - [[Conall Reese]] \\%0a%0a%25werewolf%25 "One of the very few Others I don't one-hundred percent despise. She's earned the right to join my hunts...still has to ask permission though." - [[Bishop Clayton|Outlaw's Bane]]%0a%0a%25changeling%25 “Ever get that thing when you first see someone or meet someone and you're just like, yeah, thats who I want. Yep had that. Took a few years to come to fruition, but the best things do. With that in mind, I'll always do my best to have her back, as I know she'd have mine. and if you hurt her... well, I'm prepared to spend years making the revenge manifest too. Assuming she didn't kill you herself by then.”  [[Sylvester Eldridge]]. \\%0a%0a%25vampire%25 "so much fun to play with, wants what fitzy give.

Vrys mentions being part of another Freehold down in California that collapsed due to infighting and the predations of the Hunters but won’t specify where and how long.
