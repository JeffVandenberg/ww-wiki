Description%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a[Vrischika appears to be a well built woman of Egyptian descent, hourglass figure and dusky skin rising at about six feet and an inch or two. Her deep mahogany eyes swallow the light with a sharp hunger that seems to sharpen when she gives a leery grin. Her long black-brown hair frames her face, often sporting a set of beads while the rest flows down between her shoulders in wavy locks that curl just at the tip. Her voice hits the ear rough and searing and she loves hearing herself talk.%0a%0aA tattooed wadjet frames her right eye and Arabic script runs down her back in a waterfall of ink down to her tail bone. When she’s not covered up in her usual leather jacket and cottony tees, a clean cut scar runs along her left ribs and bicep. Three distinct claw scars mark her upper right thigh.%0a%0aHer Mein lends her dusky skin a slight reflective gleam of chitinflesh and harder plate covers her joints, lending hard edges to her wrists, elbows, and along her jawline. The sclera of her eyes turn dark brown with a black pupil that eerily lights with cerulean when the light hits them just right. Four smaller, unblinking occeli dot her cheekbones. When she grins, her jaw opens just a little too wide and her teeth are black and sharp with her upper and lower canines transformed into dagger-like fangs. Her long, blue tongue often slips out to taste the air as she flexes the retractile hook claws at her finger tips.]%0a%0a----%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=450px height=600px%25https://pre13.deviantart.net/ed5c/th/pre/f/2017/222/0/c/parah_by_sakimichan-dbjlue2.jpg%0a!! Public Background%0a%0a[The Spider came to Portland at the tail of December in 2016, searching out the Lost community through a variety of rumor hoarding, foot work, and plain old luck.

Though she has a Californian accent, some can catch snatches of Arabic can be heard muttered beneath her breath when she’s particularly upset.%0a%0aShe’s spooked around the Embassy and often visits the Revolucion Coffee House wearing the colors of Beirut. Vrys mentions being part of another Freehold down in California that collapsed due to infighting and the predations of the Hunters but won’t specify where and how long. She's currently the Changeling Emissary to the Uratha of Portland (Status 3) and a high ranking recruiter of the Portland Fight Club (Status 4).%0a----%0a%0a!! Hooks%0a%0a*“Fight Club Trainer” (Combat Oriented, Portland Fight Club): Vrischika has a competitive streak and a love for down and dirty fights that she wears on her sleeve. She is also a member of the Portland Fight Club as an established member and personal trainer. If you’re the kind of person who wants to test themselves on the Spider, she’s more than willing to throw down. She likes to keep score and she savors the thrill of the fight, win or lose. The Spider doesn’t have a fight pad just yet but she’s definitely working on that; until then she’ll throwdown any place out of the way, to knockdown or first blood.%0a%0a*“Kin of Long Fangs” (Werewolves): The Spider is theappointed Emissary of the Three Pillar Freehold and is actively cultivating her bonds with the various People and Packs that live in Portland. If you’re a Werewolf, a Wolf-Blood, or an ally of them and have any matters to bring with the Fae of Portland, come to this Spider and she’ll do what she can to arbitrate your problems. She is especially interested in helping fight the Hosts and has assisted in hunts on both Azlu and Belishu%0a%0a*“Hunt the Hunters” (Changelings, Supernatural): Vrys hates the Huntsmen with an acid vitriol. She is a founding member of the Broken Hunt, a motley dedicated to further delay or even prevent the return of a Huntsman. They have defeated one such Huntsman, The Flautist, sent by Vrys' own Keeper to return a fleeing Changeling outside of the Freehold.%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a%0a!!
