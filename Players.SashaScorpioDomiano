She's slightly above average height (5'6) with a fit, reliable frame. Her tousled strawberry blonde hair generally falls past her shoulders, but it can change in length and color from day to day. Her pale features are dusted with freckles, a healthy set of dark eye brows sit above arresting clear blue eyes, and her rose-hued lips are more likely to split into a telling smile than a frown. Her attire skews toward rugged outdoors wear, from weatherproof hiking pants to layered shirts in varying hues of blue, green, and violet. She always wears a copper locket around her neck, a collection of woven bracelets in a rainbow of colors encircle her right wrist, and a sturdy watch with well-worn leather straps wraps her left wrist. %0a%0a\\%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ff/2b/27/ff2b272933942d9239c1fd5860850f50.png%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=right border='2px solid #286c89' margin-top=10px margin-left=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=15px width=230px height=230px%25https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8c/ca/9c/8cca9c8a623100e26c15c7a33b2ee7f4.jpg%0a!!!!%25center%25%25color=#286c89%25 ''This We'll Defend (Military Service Members)''%0a%25center%25Sasha doesn't hide the fact that she is a U.S. Army veteran, but she doesn't actively broadcast it either. Her pride for the service is reserved and understated.

Her tousled strawberry blonde hair generally falls past her shoulders, but it can change in length and color from day to day. Her pale features are dusted with freckles, a healthy set of dark eye brows sit above arresting clear blue eyes, and her rose-hued lips are more likely to split into a telling smile than a frown. Her attire skews toward rugged outdoors wear, from weatherproof hiking pants to layered shirts in varying hues of blue, green, and violet. She always wears a copper locket around her neck, a collection of woven bracelets in a rainbow of colors encircle her right wrist, and a sturdy watch with well-worn leather straps wraps her left wrist. %0a%3c %0a---%0a> %25center%25[Enter Here]%0a> %0a54c54%0a%3c %25center%25Vernal: People find themselves surging with vigor as a feeling of spry blooming youth washes over them.%0a---%0a> %25center%25[Enter Here] %0a
