She's slightly above average height (5'6) with a fit, reliable frame. Her tousled strawberry blonde hair generally falls past her shoulders, but it can change in length and color from day to day. Her pale features are dusted with freckles, a healthy set of dark eye brows sit above arresting clear blue eyes, and her rose-hued lips are more likely to split into a telling smile than a frown. Her attire skews toward rugged outdoors wear, from weatherproof hiking pants to layered shirts in varying hues of blue, green, and violet. She always wears a copper locket around her neck, a collection of woven bracelets in a rainbow of colors encircle her right wrist, and a sturdy watch with well-worn leather straps wraps her left wrist. %0a%0a\\%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e8/6c/5e/e86c5e6da6a3392b135573aab954a206.png%0a%0a!!!!!%25center%25%25mage%25''Long term''%0a%0a%25center%25Vernal: People find themselves surging with vigor as a feeling of spry, blooming youth washes over them.%0a%0a!!!!!%25center%25%25mage%25''Immediate''%0a%0a%25center%25Blood Rush (Dexterity +1, Strength +1, Weaponry +2 (8-again)): Blood rushes to the surface of Scorpio's skin and turns into a heated, pulsing mist that envelopes her, inciting a heady blood-lust in those that come in contact with it.

diff:1541215125:1541214132:=46,47c46,47%0a%3c %25center%25Sasha doesn't strike much of an imposing silhouette. She's slightly above average height (5'6) with a fit, reliable frame. Her tousled strawberry blonde hair generally falls past her shoulders, but it can change in length and color from day to day. Her pale features are dusted with freckles, a healthy set of dark eye brows sit above arresting clear blue eyes, and her rose-hued lips are more likely to split into a telling smile than a frown. Her attire skews toward rugged outdoors wear, from weatherproof hiking pants to layered shirts in varying hues of blue, green, and violet. She always wears a copper locket around her neck, a collection of woven bracelets in a rainbow of colors encircle her right wrist, and a sturdy watch with well-worn leather straps wraps her left wrist. %0a%3c %0a---%0a> %25center%25[Enter Here]%0a> %0a54c54%0a%3c %25center%25Vernal: People find themselves surging with vigor as a feeling of spry blooming youth washes over them.%0a---%0a> %25center%25[Enter Here] %0a
