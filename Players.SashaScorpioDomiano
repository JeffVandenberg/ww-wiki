She's slightly above average height (5'6) with a fit, reliable frame. Her tousled strawberry blonde hair generally falls past her shoulders, but it can change in length and color from day to day. Her pale features are dusted with freckles, a healthy set of dark eye brows sit above arresting clear blue eyes, and her rose-hued lips are more likely to split into a telling smile than a frown. Her attire skews toward rugged outdoors wear, from weatherproof hiking pants to layered shirts in varying hues of blue, green, and violet. She always wears a copper locket around her neck, a collection of woven bracelets in a rainbow of colors encircle her right wrist, and a sturdy watch with well-worn leather straps wraps her left wrist. %0a%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25mage%25'''Nimbus'''%0a%0a!!!!!%25center%25%25mage%25''Long term'': %0a%0a%25center%25Vernal: People find themselves surging with vigor as a feeling of spry, blooming youth washes over them.%0a%0a!!!!!%25center%25%25mage%25''Immediate'': %0a%0a%25center%25Blood Rush (Dexterity +1, Strength +1, Weaponry +2 (8-again)): Blood rushes to the surface of Scorpio's skin and turns into a heated, pulsing mist that envelopes her, inciting a heady blood-lust in those that come in contact with it.

Her pride for the service is reserved and understated. She's generally open about her time serving as a Combat Medic Specialist, but there are certain details about her multiple deployments that she steers clear of talking about to casual acquaintances. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25mage%25 ''Témoignage (Medical Professionals, Avid Volunteers)'': %0a%3c Sasha has even less willingness to discuss her time spent volunteering for Doctors Without Borders (MSF). The organization itself gets only praise from her, but specifics about what she did and why she left remain securely shielded under a veneer of honest and glowing admiration for MSF and the people who dedicate their lives to it.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25mage%25 ''To Serve, To Strive and not To Yield (Educators, Outdoors People)'': %0a%3c Sasha is a current mentor and educator with Outward Bound, the leading provider of experiential and outdoor education programs for youth and adults. She acts as a guide for outdoor survival and alpine backpacking courses. She has a true and earnest love of the outdoors and is always more than happy to speak and share about her experiences and learn about the experiences of others when it comes to exploring. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25mage%25 ''The Call of the Wild (Thyrsus, Mystagogues)'': %0a%3c Knowing what comes with Awakening as a Shaman, others who walk this Path are immediately afforded a heady respect. Her wonderment for the Primal Wilds are equally matched by her bête noire for the place that bore her and hers their power. Should she ever need to go there again, she'll walk with a big stick, and an even bigger sense of caution.%0a---%0a> !!!!%25mage%25 ''Hook 1(Who it effects)'': %0a> Hook info here%0a> %0a> !!!!%25mage%25 ''Hook 2(Who it effects)'': %0a> Hook info here%0a> %0a> !!!!%25mage%25 ''Hook 3(Who it effects)'': %0a> Hook info here%0a

diff:1541215125:1541214132:=46,47c46,47%0a%3c %25center%25Sasha doesn't strike much of an imposing silhouette. She's slightly above average height (5'6) with a fit, reliable frame. Her tousled strawberry blonde hair generally falls past her shoulders, but it can change in length and color from day to day. Her pale features are dusted with freckles, a healthy set of dark eye brows sit above arresting clear blue eyes, and her rose-hued lips are more likely to split into a telling smile than a frown. Her attire skews toward rugged outdoors wear, from weatherproof hiking pants to layered shirts in varying hues of blue, green, and violet. She always wears a copper locket around her neck, a collection of woven bracelets in a rainbow of colors encircle her right wrist, and a sturdy watch with well-worn leather straps wraps her left wrist. %0a%3c %0a---%0a> %25center%25[Enter Here]%0a> %0a54c54%0a%3c %25center%25Vernal: People find themselves surging with vigor as a feeling of spry blooming youth washes over them.%0a---%0a> %25center%25[Enter Here] %0a
