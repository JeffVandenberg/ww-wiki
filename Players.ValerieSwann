Which makes even more sense why she was created to look as she does.%0a%0a%25color=#E4C1D0%25Valerie has been endowed with a magnificent pair of antlers that grow up from the top of her head, along with a pair of elongated deer like ears. Possessing some rather intense green cat eyes, sharp white canines line her mouth, to tiny black claws that have replaced her nails at the tips of her fingers. As well as a thick luxuriously soft red fox tail too. Her legs and feet from about mid to lower thigh begin to change from human to some digitigrade legs, that appear to be from some sort of hunting cat, possibly a mountain lion.

That heat that foretells the coming of a summer evening storm on the horizon. A faint scent of ozone is almost over come by the heady scent of animal  in the air, accompanied by the quiet sound of crickets around her.%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/TcAzwA0.png%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=5px lframe width=375px bgcolor=#E4C1D0 border='5px solid black' padding=2px%25https://i.imgur.com/AqOrBIC.jpg%0a!!!%25color=#F8FBD4%25'''Touch of Summer'''%0a%25color=#E4C1D0%25''(Changelings, Summer Courtiers)'' Valerie is fairly established within the Summer court, perhaps not Portland's, but she has been a Summer Courtier for over a year now.

Possessing some rather intense green cat eyes, sharp white canines line her mouth, to tiny black claws that have replaced her nails at the tips of her fingers. As well as a thick luxuriously soft red fox tail too. Her legs and feet from about mid to lower thigh begin to change from human to some digitigrade legs, that appear to be from some sort of hunting cat, possibly a mountain lion.
