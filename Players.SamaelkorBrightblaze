He wears casually most of the time, but for concerts and other formal occasions he always wears elegant clothes or even suits, if appropriate. Being a violinist and composer, he obviously enjoys music and arts. When he plays, he looks like he goes in a sort of trance from how much he's concentrated in doing his task, and a similar thing can happen to whoever listens to him and isn't careful enough to not just let himself be driven by the music.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Mein''%0a%0a%25center%25 Under the mask, a creature of legend is hidden. The dragon that makes the changeling who he is is covered from head to toes in red and salmon-pink scales, shiny and rough to the touch. His legs are just like a dragon's, powerful and digitigrade, with sharp claws tipping their four toes. Due of that, the beast just can't wear shoes, but he doesn't worry much about that. A long and thick tail sways behind him, helping him balance his body on his oddly shaped legs. Claws tip also his hands, though make him still able to masterfully play the violin. His thick muzzle is full of sharp fangs and contains a long, prehensile tongue that give the dragon a very slight hissing accent that is accentuated when enraged or when he gives up the Mask. A pair of fan-like appendages replace his ears, and a fin-like crest adorns his head along with a pair of horns. His eyes are the most unusual part: the scleras are a dark green with light blue lines, and the irises are a bright red. Looks like his former Keeper wanted them to look like cybernetic eyes, but they're just an aesthetic mean. His new body also reflects his hidden side: he's relatively easy to anger if teased in the right way, and he often becomes violent in no time. This happens more often when people he cares of, or perhaps someone weak, is threatened or mistreated right in front of him, and in that case there's no wonder if he angers and does what he can to defend the victim.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Mantle''%0a%0a%25center%25Courtless %0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''Contacts'''%0a%0a||! %25changeling%25Image ||! %25changeling%25Name ||! %25changeling%25Relationship ||! %25changeling%25Comment ||! %25changeling%25Ringtone ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''Hooks'''%0a%0a!!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''The Violinist (Entertainment)'': %0aEver wanted to have an instrument player all for yourself?
