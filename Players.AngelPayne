The grass bends respectfully under her paw, the shadows lengthen to cover her and then retract to show her in exactly the right, horrifying light.

Muscle tenses and relaxes with every deliberate motion. Her eyes are a wild and vibrant green and contrast to her sun-kissed complexion and black hair, which is usually pulled into a single tight braid.

She favors boots or chucks on most occasions and accessories that scream "please judge me." %0a%3c %0a%3c Her freshest and most favorite tattoo is currently a large, copper colored snake coiled three times around her neck encased in blue lightning with it's fangs puncturing her jugular.

While he may still fight or flee, there’s a part of him inside that welcomes the release of death. Your character may not spend Willpower to add dice or resistance for any action to defend himself from a deadly threat. He can fuel Gifts or use other actions, but his self-defense becomes lackluster at best.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25 '''Resolution:''' Resolution: Suffer a wound penalty from lethal or aggravated damage, or suffer a lethal wound in your character’s last Health box%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25werewolf%25Description%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25center%25%25werewolf%25''Hishu Apperance''%0a%3c %25center%25[Enter Here]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25center%25%25werewolf%25''Urhan Apperance''%0a%3c %25center%25[Enter Here]%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c (:div2end:)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25werewolf%25'''Contacts'''%0a%3c %0a%3c ||! %25werewolf%25Image ||! %25werewolf%25Name ||! %25werewolf%25Relationship ||! %25werewolf%25Comment ||! %25werewolf%25Ringtone ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/BC0eaKc.png || %25werewolf%25PC Name || %25werewolf%25Relationship to PC || %25werewolf%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25werewolf%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/BC0eaKc.png || %25werewolf%25PC Name || %25werewolf%25Relationship to PC || %25werewolf%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25werewolf%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/BC0eaKc.png || %25werewolf%25PC Name || %25werewolf%25Relationship to PC || %25werewolf%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25werewolf%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/BC0eaKc.png || %25werewolf%25PC Name || %25werewolf%25Relationship to PC || %25werewolf%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25werewolf%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/BC0eaKc.png || %25werewolf%25PC Name || %25werewolf%25Relationship to PC || %25werewolf%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25werewolf%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c %0a%3c (:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25werewolf%25'''Hooks'''%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25werewolf%25 ''Primal Alterations(Everybody)'': %0a%3c Primal Alterations is the name of Angel's shop. Located in a small stripmall in the heart of Miami. It's part Barbershop and part Tattoo Parlor. If you're looking for some new ink or a wild and sexy new hair do, stop in and see if Angel can hook it up. She's not cheap, but her old man always told her if you're good at something, never do it for free. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25werewolf%25 ''The Copperhead Queens(Werewolves)'': %0a%3c The name of Angel's pack, or rather the dynamic duo of her and her significant other. One is a wild hellcat and the other is a tame, sweet kitten, but which is which. Woe to those who brave the test and choose poorly. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25werewolf%25 ''A Little Famous(Everyone)'': %0a%3c Angel spent some time as a Suicide Girl and Sullen Model when she first got her start in the tattoo business and proudly displays some her better prints in her shop. She doesn't really talk about that part of her life though, and just likes to look at the fruits of her labor.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25werewolf%25 ''Ride the Lightning(Law Enforcement)'': %0a%3c Born to a mother condemned to die on Florida's Death Row, Angel watched the switch get flipped and it sparked something in her that day. Since then, she's served the state as an Executioner on several occasions and shares their stories in her artwork. %0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c (:div2end:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:cellnr width=100%25:)%0a%3c !!%25center%25%25werewolf%25'''Quotes'''%0a%3c %0a%3c %25mortal%25 "I am a quote!
