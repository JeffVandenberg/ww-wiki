He was recruited to the crusade to return to Miami in the 80’s from Atlanta.  It was Edgar Manson who was haunted by visions of a drowned elder.

He is not a warrior in the traditional sense.  His weapon is his mind and connection with the gods.  He is the prophet who reads the signs.  He is the mentor who guides the spiritually thirsty.

He is the one who delves into things others would leave forgotten.  %0a%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25vampire%25'''Hooks'''%0a%0a!!!!%25vampire%25 ''Prophet of the Gods(Kindred):'' %0aEdgar claims to speak for the gods.
