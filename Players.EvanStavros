It must be going well, for there's no impression of weakness- just a sort of delicacy and a firm sense of the awkward, in the way that the sick often recognize they make others uncomfortable, as if the imposition of merely existing and reminding everyone nearby that they are, in fact, mortal is somehow a social gaffe- which, of course, it isn't. Long strands of glossy, dark hair are kept trapped by a hair tie, flanking eyes that carry the faint dullness of someone whose energy is chronically rerouted into fixing whatever happens to be wrong with their body. Even so, it can't quite mask the keen awareness of the mind behind them- or the odd, hungry look that sometimes surfaces, while staring into space- or right at you.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Mein''%0a%0a%25center%25 A gaunt figure, Caucasian, whose skin was never meant to be stretched quite so thin over a too-thin frame. Its pallor could be a result of the drifting winds, or simply a natural feature- there's a sense of Winter around, despite the Summer Mantle. For all the signs of near-terminal hunger, there's no impression of weakness- just a sort of delicacy and a firm sense of the awkward, in the way that the sick often recognize they make others uncomfortable, as if the imposition of merely existing and reminding everyone nearby that they are, in fact, mortal is somehow a social gaffe- which, of course, it isn't. Long strands of glossy, dark hair are secured against constant, drifting breezes by a hair tie, flanking eyes that are- to be cliche- "like doll's eyes", simultaneously flat and sharp-gazed, the eyes of a starved predator, tired but all the more dangerous for it. Even that can't quite mask the keen awareness of the mind behind them- or the odd, hungry look that sometimes surfaces, while staring into space- or right at you. Of note? That mouth is closed or close to it at all times. It leads to some mumbling occasionally, but during outbursts or moments of forgetfulness, brief glimpses of identical slabs of flat, grinding teeth can be snatched behind lips the same unmistakable shade as fresh blood.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Mantle''%0a%0a%25center%25 Light reflects funny sometimes near Evan, like the long beams of unending sunlight near the poles in summer flashing off endless fields of snowglare. Despite the occasional drifting touch of aggressively cold air, it all carries a sense that things could always get much, much colder- that this is somehow the warm time, regardless of the chill.%0a%0aIt always passes.%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''History'''%0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Before''%0a%0a%25center%25 Born in 2000 to parents employed by the Russian government, Evan's early life was marked by prosperity. He flourished in his parent's care, proving a quick- if relatively average- study in all subjects, though academics were never something he really cared to pursue specifically. While he was originally particularly interested in ballet, at the time he didn't really have the physique or coordination to pursue the art. So instead, he settled for being an enthusiast, attending many performances while turning his own pursuits towards the Russian sport of boxing. Here, he found a niche, his natural tenacity and quick learning leading him to excel despite a relatively average build, leading him to compete successfully throughout his high school career.%0a%0aAfter graduation, Evan enlisted in the army and reported for basic training. While not a particularly good shot, he was excellent in close combat and decent with the improvised weapon training they received to learn to use their weapons up close and personal. During one of these drills, a lucky shot from an opponent smashed his nose, breaking it and sending him to the infirmary spouting blood down his face. A momentary distraction en route left him placing his bloodied hand on a doorframe, and when he stepped through a moment later, it was into the Hedge.%0a%0aIt wasn't long before a band of privateers in contract with Le General Taire scooped him up.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''During''%0a%0a%25center%25 Evan's role wasn't so much a good fit for him as he was made to fit it. The previous Black Wind of Verdun had grown tired of its tasks, and worn out its favor with the silent master of Verdun. The essence of wind and grace and hunger was forcibly torn from the previous bearer of that task, a chiurgical procedure that Evan remembers nothing of. All he recalls is being strapped down, a general recollection of terror and pain, and then- being The Black Wind.%0a%0aHis task was to scourge the various battlefields of Verdun and ensure that no battle stagnated long. His tools were cold and lack and despair, weakness and hunger and scything winds. He ate everything he could. Ammo, weapons, frostbitten body parts, food stores, clothing- and more, his winds cold enough to leech the literal strength from the marrow of his victims. %0a%0aIt was never enough.%0a%0aUntold ages passed. Consumed by unceasing, relentless hunger, The Black Wind howled over Verdun without end. Those trapped in those battles came to know him as well, impartial and brutal and inevitable. Escapees from the General carried the scars of his oppression back to the real world, oblique mention of him leaking into real world media through game developers and authors. Evan didn't care. He was winter hunger, relentless and unceasing.%0a%0aUntil one of the new recruits started humming one of Tchaikovsky's pieces.%0a%0aDistant, gleaming memories of impossibly elegant forms dancing through fantastic set pieces to unbelievable musical scores dug into Evan's mind like fishhooks. Wheeling on the spot, The Black Wind tore its way across Verdun and into the Hedge, carving a path through the Thorns and patching the holes in its spirit with the guzzled, gobbled verdant leftovers.%0a%0aThe man that emerged into Saint Petersburg, however, had very little still in common with the young man who stumbled into the Hedge mere weeks ago.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''After''%0a%0a%25center%25 His stay changed him, as Arcadia does. Where Evan had once been solidly built, he was thin, bordering on gaunt. Where his form had been stocky and built for enduring rough Russian winters, his body was now tapered down, designed for speed instead. Whipcord muscles had replaced mass, and while he resembled himself by way of features, his own had narrowed and been left pale. He looked like he'd spent months or years either abusing drugs or fighting off illness, between the changes and the aging.

His hair is long and scruffy, as is his beard, though each is kept clean- not that it hides the rusted stains around his jaws.%0a> %0a87a88,95%0a> ----%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''Gallery'''%0a> %0a> || border=1%0a> || %25thumb newwin%25[[https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/56e816f0009685193dafc20b/master/w_1440,h_1080,c_limit/mark-seliger-oscars-2016-adrien-brody.jpg|https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/56e816f0009685193dafc20b/master/w_1440,h_1080,c_limit/mark-seliger-oscars-2016-adrien-brody.jpg]] || %25thumb newwin%25[[https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aArRIQX6_rI/maxresdefault.jpg|https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aArRIQX6_rI/maxresdefault.jpg]] || %25thumb newwin%25[[https://i.imgur.com/xCVo655.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/xCVo655.jpg]] ||%0a> || %25thumb newwin%25[[https://adrienbrodyfansite.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/adrien-brody-gq-style-brazil-summer-2015-cover-photo-shoot-003.jpg|https://adrienbrodyfansite.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/adrien-brody-gq-style-brazil-summer-2015-cover-photo-shoot-003.jpg]] || %25thumb newwin%25[[https://i.imgur.com/dnnCJmL.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/dnnCJmL.jpg]] || %25thumb newwin%25[[https://66.media.tumblr.com/558e6421441d156891b68857258a58ed/tumblr_nfh6xvmC9S1u3ts08o1_1280.jpg|https://66.media.tumblr.com/558e6421441d156891b68857258a58ed/tumblr_nfh6xvmC9S1u3ts08o1_1280.jpg]] ||%0a> %0a
