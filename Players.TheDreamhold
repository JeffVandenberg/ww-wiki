Our most potent rules lie around it: protect them from ourselves and us from them.  Though what of the other threats that lurk in the dark places?  They don’t always come for you but sometimes they come for them: humanity.  %0a%0aWhether you were broken by the nightmare fae from beyond the world, awakened and found a spark within you, felt that connection to the primal world and the moon ignite within you, or felt your life darken to a shadow like the night sky, you know the importance of humanity.  The bulwark has failed you, the embassy grows weak, and the bonds of unity waver.  That failure doesn’t define you and though your world has changed forever we can make it so others have a chance at life with their loved ones.  Take up arms, focus your magic, turn failure into success as we slip right past the notice of the ones we protect.  We won’t fail them.  We can’t fail them and we won’t fail you.%0a%0aWe hold a dream for the world of humanity.  A world of peace, prosperity, and protection where all have the chance at a life worth living.  Our knights venture out into the world to act with compassion and grace while helping the needy.  Our sentinels stand watch where the world grows thin and the nightmares beyond grow strong.  Our guardians face daunting challenges in a race against time while darkness tries to break them.  The dream is fleeting but it's always like a star in the heavens; perhaps we'll reach it one day.  Till then we will work with our every breath to make that dream a reality.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''%25color=#ff6666%25Purpose''' \\%0a%0aThe Dreamhold is devoted to protecting humanity from the dangers of Arcadia, the Abyss, and other twisted realms.  It’s members may or may not be part of a Freehold and some have rejected the freehold in favor of focusing their efforts on keeping humanity safe instead of their own hides.  All members are encouraged to keep a watchful eye on their neighborhoods and towns while fae members often walk the local dreaming roads several times a week to look for local threats.%0a%0a*%25color=#999999%25'''Moon'''%25%25:  Sentinels of the moon take up the banner of protection for the dreamhold and all of humanity around them.  Knowledge gained from this path cultivates the sentinels body and soul to be more resilient.  Often times they bare moonlit tattoos or a plethora of scars from rigorous training.  %0a*%25color=#808080%25'''Stars'''%25%25:  Sentinels of the stars take up the roll of the sword against the enemies of humanity.  They use not only their keen blades to cut down foes but also can use the very world around them to strike at their foes.  Many Sentinels of the stars bare a mark on their brow.%0a*%25color=#add8e6%25'''Sky'''%25%25:  Sentinels of the sky embrace the ideals of support just as the sky provides rain to the crops and rivers.  These sentinels are strong in the ways of healing or offering potent boons in the way of the finest goblin fruits.  Many own plots in the hedge or tend to gardens in places where the barrier between worlds grows thin in the real world.  Sentinels of the sky bare a mark above their heart or in the palm of each hand.%0a*%25color=#00ff7f%25'''Earth'''%25%25:  Sentinels of the earth take up the mantle of reinforcement to make it more difficult for the agents of arcadia or elsewhere to intrude upon the world.  Objects can be made with some semblance of intelligence and can be trained to fight even.  These are the most potent artificers within the Dreamhold.  Sentinels of the earth bare a mark on the back of each hand.%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''%25color=#ff6666%25Oath''' \\%0a%0a%25center%25''"I pledge to guard humanity and help guide them to a better future. I vow to act as a guiding light just as the stars, light the darkness like the moon, inspire the mind like the sky, and support like the sturdy earth.  With these ideals at heart I will make the right choice when fear awakens.  United together, our strength from each other, I promise always to be brave.”''%0a%0a:%25color=#ff6666%25Heraldry:%0a*Symbols:  The moon, stars, beds, hearth, %0a*Hedgespun items that are appropriately themed.  aka moonblade, cloaks, star pendants or shields%0a%0a:%25color=#ff6666%25Important Events:%0a*Full Moon%0a*Any Celestial Event%0a*Blood Moon%0a*Solar Eclipses%0a%0a:%25color=#ff6666%25Dreamhold Locations:%0a*Emberlight - Hollow%0a*A future music venue/theater%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''%25color=#ff6666%25Titles and Mechanics''' \\%0a%0a||! %25color=#ff6666%25Rank ||! %25color=#ff6666%25Title ||! %25color=#ff6666%25Power ||%0a||! %25color=#ff6666%25Oathed ||! %25color=#ff6666%25Initiate ||! %25color=#ff6666%25Oath Benefits ||%0a|| • || Sentinel || Empathy Specialty (Dreams) ||%0a|| •• || Guardian of the Moon || '''Moon:'''  1 dot hedgespun weapon ||%0a|| •• || Guardian of the Stars || '''Stars:'''  1 dot hedgespun weapon ||%0a|| •• || Guardian of the Sky || '''Sky:'''  1 dot hedgespun armor ||%0a|| •• || Guardian of the Earth || '''Earth:'''  1 dot hedgespun armor ||%0a|| ••• || Knight of the Moon || '''Moon:'''  Protective:  Temple Guardian (••) ||%0a|| ••• || Knight of the Stars || '''Stars:'''  Gain +1 weaponry or +1 athletics ||%0a|| ••• || Knight of the Sky || '''Sky:'''  Healing:  Bounty (••) ||%0a|| ••• || Knight of the Earth || '''Earth:'''  +1 to Crafts ||%0a|| •••• || Warden of the Moon || '''Moon:'''  Augmented Resilience.

Our knights venture out into the world to act with compassion and grace while helping the needy.  Our sentinels stand watch where the world grows thin and the nightmares beyond grow strong.  Our guardians face daunting challenges in a race against time while darkness tries to break them.  The dream is fleeting but it's always like a star in the heavens; perhaps we'll reach it one day.

Our most potent rules lie around it: protect them from ourselves and us from them.  Though what of the other threats that lurk in the dark places?  They don’t always come for you but sometimes they come for them: humanity.  %0a%3c %0a%3c Whether you were broken by the nightmare fae from beyond the world, awakened and found a spark within you, felt that connection to the primal world and the moon ignite within you, or felt your life darken to a shadow like the night sky, you know the importance of humanity.  The bulwark has failed you, the embassy grows weak, and the bonds of unity waver.  That failure doesn’t define you and though your world has changed forever we can make it so others have a chance at life with their loved ones.  Take up arms, focus your magic, turn failure into success as we slip right past the notice of the ones we protect.  We won’t fail them.  We can’t fail them and we won’t fail you.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''%25color=#008080%25Purpose''' \\%0a%3c %0a%3c The Dreamhold is devoted to protecting humanity from the dangers of Arcadia, the Abyss, and other twisted realms.  It’s members may or may not be part of a Freehold and some have rejected the freehold in favor of focusing their efforts on keeping humanity safe instead of their own hides.  All members are encouraged to keep a watchful eye on their neighborhoods and towns while fae members often walk the local dreaming roads several times a week to look for local threats.%0a%3c %0a%3c *'''Moon''':  Sentinels of the moon take up the banner of protection for the dreamhold and all of humanity around them.  Knowledge gained from this path cultivates the sentinels body and soul to be more resilient.  Often times they bare moonlit tattoos or a plethora of scars from rigorous training.  %0a%3c *'''Stars''':  Sentinels of the stars take up the roll of the sword against the enemies of humanity.  They use not only their keen blades to cut down foes but also can use the very world around them to strike at their foes.  Many Sentinels of the stars bare a mark on their brow.%0a%3c *'''Sky''':  Sentinels of the sky embrace the ideals of support just as the sky provides rain to the crops and rivers.  These sentinels are strong in the ways of healing or offering potent boons in the way of the finest goblin fruits.  Many own plots in the hedge or tend to gardens in places where the barrier between worlds grows thin in the real world.  Sentinels of the sky bare a mark above their heart or in the palm of each hand.%0a%3c *'''Earth''':  Sentinels of the earth take up the mantle of reinforcement to make it more difficult for the agents of arcadia or elsewhere to intrude upon the world.  Objects can be made with some semblance of intelligence and can be trained to fight even.  These are the most potent artificers within the Dreamhold.  Sentinels of the earth bare a mark on the back of each hand.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''%25color=#008080%25Oath''' \\%0a%3c %0a%3c ''"I pledge to guard humanity and help guide them to a better future. I vow to act as a guiding light just as the stars, light the darkness like the moon, inspire the mind like the sky, and support like the moon.
