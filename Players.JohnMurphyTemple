Although most of the towers in the area are residential apartments, One Hundred Tower is commercial real estate, favoring tenants in buy-side financial services and other quantitative businesses. Many of its offices are still empty, and the leasing team is offering attractive promotions to pull in more renters.%0a%0aThe building's exterior is an elegant fusion of art deco and modern glass. The interior is of somewhat more classic design, with marbled flooring and mahogany paneling on the walls. Periodically, however, the paneling is broken up with a column of square marble reaching to the ceiling, inlaid with metal latticework that carries the geometric patterning of the exterior's art deco styling. There is nothing economical or efficient about the design--it is art for art's own sake. %0a%0a!! %25center%25%25color=#008080%25The Temple Iliomachian%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=25px margin-right=25px width=250px height=250px%25https://i.imgur.com/JvVGvkt.jpg%0aThe first floor of One Hundred Tower contains a lobby, service corridors, and an elevator bay--but no offices or common areas apart from those. The second floor and third floor are similarly barren and, indeed, only one of the elevators even stops there. In truth, this space has been blocked off to make it inaccessible to those not in the know. An interior court has been built into this space, and recessed somewhat into what should be the basement.  Here sits the heart of One Hundred Tower, the Temple Iliomachian.%0a%0aFrom the face of it, the Temple Iliomachian appears at first glance to be a series of colonnades built in classic Greek or Roman style. The temple is not open, however, for a great barrier has been built about half the height of the columns, upon which is depicted mythic scenes in frieze. Gods and monsters do battle in these friezes, many of them copied from extant artifacts in major museums. Scenes from the Greek Titanomachy are present, as are representations of battles between Marduk and Tiamat and Michael and Lucifer. %0a%0aThrough the temple doors, dozens and dozens of columns run, many of them adorned with carvings or paintings representing similar themes. Across a sort of iconostasis blocking the inner sanctum--nearly the center of the whole temple itself--is a dire carving. Learned savants might realize that it represents Apophis swallowing the sun, Ra and Set defeated and the Barque of a Million Years broken. %0a%0aIn the inner sanctuary, great and terrible statues rise up along the central altar--Typhon, Echidna, and Cerberus. The great three-headed dog looms over the altar table, all eyes watching the place of sacrifice. Behind Cerberus towers Typhon and Echidna, each a terrible amalgamation of human and serpent and stranger beasts. Each statue rises up so much vaster than a man, and seems to carry a terrible enormity that dwarfs its actual size.%0a%0a!! %25center%25%25color=#008080%25Trismegistus Capital Partners%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=250px height=250px%25https://i.imgur.com/1hofGVE.jpg%0aThe fourth floor contains the most accessible entrances to the Temple Iliomachian.

diff:1597562634:1597471507:=38,41c38,40%0a%3c Impressive without being gaudy, a recently-completed skyscraper called One Hundred Tower stands tall, located at 100 N.E. 8th St., in Park West. Although most of the towers in the area are residential apartments, One Hundred Tower is commercial real estate, favoring tenants in buy-side financial services and other quantitative businesses. Many of its offices are still empty, and the leasing team is offering attractive promotions to pull in more renters.%0a%3c %0a%3c The building's exterior is an elegant fusion of art deco and modern glass. The interior is of somewhat more classic design, with marbled flooring and mahogany paneling on the walls. Periodically, however, the paneling is broken up with a column of square marble reaching to the ceiling, inlaid with metal latticework that carries the geometric patterning of the exterior's art deco styling. There is nothing economical or efficient about the design--it is art for art's own sake. %0a%3c %0a---%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.%0a> %0a> %0a43,49c42%0a%3c The first floor of One Hundred Tower contains a lobby, service corridors, and an elevator bay--but no offices or common areas apart from those. The second floor and third floor are similarly barren and, indeed, only one of the elevators even stops there. In truth, this space has been blocked off to make it inaccessible to those not in the know. An interior court has been built into this space, and recessed somewhat into what should be the basement.  Here sits the heart of One Hundred Tower, the Temple Iliomachian.%0a%3c %0a%3c From the face of it, the Temple Iliomachian appears at first glance to be a series of colonnades built in classic Greek or Roman style. The temple is not open, however, for a great barrier has been built about half the height of the columns, upon which is depicted mythic scenes in frieze. Gods and monsters do battle in these friezes, many of them copied from extant artifacts in major museums. Scenes from the Greek Titanomachy are present, as are representations of battles between Marduk and Tiamat and Michael and Lucifer. %0a%3c %0a%3c Through the temple doors, dozens and dozens of columns run, many of them adorned with carvings or paintings representing similar themes. Across a sort of iconostasis blocking the inner sanctum--nearly the center of the whole temple itself--is a dire carving. Learned savants might realize that it represents Apophis swallowing the sun, Ra and Set defeated and the Barque of a Million Years broken. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the inner sanctuary, great and terrible statues rise up along the central altar--Typhon, Echidna, and Cerberus.
