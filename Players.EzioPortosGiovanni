He got the best of one and the worst of the other.  At just 6 feet tall Ezio actually comes in a touch taller than the average Italian male.  While he was born in New Orleans, his entire family is pure Italian and most of them first generation and it shows.  His skin constantly seems tanned while his eyes are bright and blue, intensely so.  His body is highly toned from constant athletic endeavors.  Outward appearances scream that Ezio has the entire package well put together.  A well crafted image for sure.  Even as the lights dim and the shadows grow darker when he enters a room when in one of his moods he has that winning smile that some fall in love with and others are roped into a seething hatred for.  Sometimes the devil has an angels smile and sometimes an angels smile is simply that, an angel.   His words are tainted with the most faint of new orleans accent which hes never lost, that is until he speaks Italian of which he is fluent as if he was native.  It is after all his first language.  Anyone who speaks the language of the Holy Roman church and smiles like an angel surely cant be anything but, right?%0a%0a%25center%25 https://i.imgur.com/whVD0kr.jpg%0a%0aThose who spend enough time with Ezio will begin to see the haunted look behind those blue eyes.  Hes a man whose rearing saw him being quite challenged and put in situations he has since come to realize are not normal.  Growing up with necromantic, necrophiliac and incestuous family members have a tendency to skew your social norms.

The land deal and contracts of course were quite lucrative to the city council and its members, while the construction has left things in its area marred for some time.  None of that matters now as the doors are open and vice and hedonism are welcomed inside.  The Resort and Casino is an escape from the darkness that drifts over your every day life.  You have 2 large nightclubs offered inside the Casino.  Vice is a typical nightclub which offers sexy young men and women sweating together on a dance floor dominated by driving dance music and flashing lights.  The second club, the Precipice caters to those who love live music with a darker, often heavier bent.  %0a%0a4 restaurants can be found providing the top of the line cuisine.  Teppan offers the finest and freshest available seafood and sushi.  Authentic Japanese faire of all types is able to be gotten here in an atmosphere that hearkens to his time in Japan. Avia Giovannis, often just called Avia is named after his Aunt and is as it sounds a true Italian restaurant.  Aqua caters to those who want to have dinner drinks while listening to live music thats not so loud you cant have a conversation.  Each night has a different type of music so choose your evening for your favorite music and come find your new favorite spot to eat.  Finally there is Horizon, named after the Resort obviously.  Horizon was originally the Tao in Vegas until Ezio purchased the Tao.  Leaving some of the Taos as they were he has turned the one in Portland into the Horizon.  Offering everything Tao does he strives to not only maintain the reputation of Tao but to outreach it.%0a%0aLive theater can be found as stage acts and bands are brought into the theater on site.  The theater currently has no house act so its constantly on the lookout for performers who are looking for steady work at an environment and for someone who can get you into the big time.%0a%0aMore will be described in the soon to come Location Wiki.%0a%0a!%25mage%25 Most Important in My Life%0a(:cellnr width=50%25 align=left style='padding-left: 10px;':)%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=4px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=0px width=100%25https://i.imgur.com/kuARVnu.jpg%0a%0aWell what can be said about Fabio that Fabio wont tell you himself.

A massive international business conglomerate which had its fingers in dozens upon dozens of pies all around the world.  Since then he has parlayed that into becoming a respected philanthropist and eventually into the jet setting endorsement machine he is now.  He has been in magazines, commercials and of course, tabloids.  He'd love to be a private person but for some, fame is the only protection method they have left.%0a%0a!!!Who doesnt like to be pampered and spend money%0aEzios latest business venture is finally complete and open for business right here in Portland.  Having opened the first in Tokyo, the second in Vegas, the third in Milan and finally the fourth here in Portland the Horizon Resort and Casino caters to anyone who enjoys being pampered.  The resort boasts 2 nightclubs, 4 choices of fine dining restaurants a full movie theater with 8 screens and any other amenity you could imagine finding inside a full scale resort.  Portland's had casinos for years but this is the first resort and hes looking to make a splash with it.  Of course hes looking for people to spend their money as well.%0a%0a!!!A little bit of crime goes a long way%0aHaving been born into and raised within one of the most twisted of not only criminal families but vampiric criminal families the world has ever seen, Ezio understands that crime can in fact pay.  Hes done his share of criminal deeds and thankfully has avoided trouble from those minor and severe events.  Hes trying to stay legitimate and clean of all entrapment's and ties.  Its never easy and hes dealt with numerous scum and villainy along the way.%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='0px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=25px width=400px%25 https://i.imgur.com/o0VAwhe.jpg%0a%0a%0a!!!A Man of Business%0aHorizon Group has had its hand in numerous corporations.  It owns a plethora of them in all fields of business and has invested to keep others alive as well.  He is always on the lookout for a good business investment that will pay dividends to all parties in the end.%0a%0a!!!Family Means Everything%0aDue to circumstances beyond his control his own family has been left behind, but it doesnt mean they havent left their mark on him.  Ezio craves family and envies those who have strong familial ties and have maintained them.  The SanGiovanni are always looming in his life.  Many have come from the family or crossed the family or know of the families depravity and this often means Ezio is associated with it.  The worst part for him, is he doesnt know he feels about that.%0a%0a!!!Ive traveled a bit%0aEzio has seen the world.  Hes traveled on business and pleasure.  Hes dined in almost all major cities and has enjoyed the sites in nearly every country for some period of a time.  Hes constantly on the go which is why Portland is such a change of pace for him.  Some would say he lost a horrible bet.  Its possible, Ezio loves to gamble.%0a%0a!!!I love the odds%0aBusiness as a whole is gambling on a massive scale and he enjoys every moment of the rush it provides.  Hes often found himself suckered into a card game or taken to the track to drop thousands of dollars.  Its a struggle hes only able to overcome when walking the halls of his own resort and casinos.  The addiction is very very real.%0a%0a!!!Always on the Hunt for Good Talent%0aThe Horizon Resort and Casino has hired hundreds of Portland of locals and has brought in others from outside the city, but its not enough to feed the machine.  They are always looking for people to come and provide services for a good pay and even better benefits at the land of heavenly fun.  For those of you that are worried, fear not.  Fabio has no authority or will ever have authority over any employee within any Horizon Group entity, regardless of what he says.%0a*Performers of all kinds (Looking for 2 or 3 solid steady money making acts)%0a*Dealers for all casino games%0a*Pit bosses for all shifts%0a*Hotel workers / concierges and managers%0a*Housekeeping and maintenance staff%0a*Restaurant staff%0a*Parking Lot Attendants%0a*Security (All Levels if Qualified)%0a%0a----%0a%0a%0a!!Gossip%0a%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='0px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=300px%25 https://i.imgur.com/rOkl6KC.jpg%0a%0aThere is loads of gossip about Ezio, its hard not to have rumors floating around about someone whose face has been plastered everywhere and linked to dozen of product campaigns.  Its possible for you to believe damn near anything about Ezio Giovanni.  Sometimes the most outrageous of rumors turn out to be the true ones.%0a%0a%25mortal%25 "I am a quote!

The worst part for him, is he doesnt know he feels about that.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Ive traveled a bit%0a%3c Ezio has seen the world.  Hes traveled on business and pleasure.  Hes dined in almost all major cities and has enjoyed the sites in nearly every country for some period of a time.  Hes constantly on the go which is why Portland is such a change of pace for him.  Some would say he lost a horrible bet.  Its possible, Ezio loves to gamble.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!I love the odds%0a%3c Business as a whole is gambling on a massive scale and he enjoys every moment of the rush it provides.  Hes often found himself suckered into a card game or taken to the track to drop thousands of dollars.  Its a struggle hes only able to overcome when walking the halls of his own resort and casinos.  The addiction is very very real.%0a---%0a> %25lfloat text-align=center border='0px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=25px width=400px%25 https://i.imgur.com/CZRrTt8.jpg%0a> %0a> %0a> !!!Polyglot%0a> Max has a knack for words!

A massive international business conglomerate which had its fingers in dozens upon dozens of pies all around the world.  Since then he has parlayed that into becoming a respected philanthropist and eventually into the jet setting endorsement machine he is now.

Literally, A good portion of her life has been rotating between their couches, guest rooms, and even the back seat of a car, the queen of couch surfing.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!I wear my Heart on my Sleeve%0a%3c Max loves love!  Other people's.  She will go out of her way to help people connect, but when it comes to herself it's rare she lets anything become more than a casual affair.  Despite her feisty nature, she's a big softy and finds it rough bouncing back from a heart break.  %0a---%0a> %0a> !! %25bgcolor=black mage%25Hooks%0a> %0a> !!!!!%25bgcolor=black mage%25 Hook 1(Who it effects): %0a> Hook info here%0a> %0a> !!!!!%25bgcolor=black mage%25 Hook 2(Who it effects): %0a> Hook info here%0a> %0a> !!!!!%25bgcolor=black mage%25 Hook 3(Who it effects): %0a> Hook info here%0a> %0a109,148c111,123%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!Gossip%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center border='0px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=300px%25 https://i.imgur.com/szfbYha.jpg%0a%3c %0a%3c "I am not the only traveler%0a%3c Who has not repaid his debt%0a%3c I've been searching for a trail to follow again%0a%3c Take me back to the night we met" - "The Night We met" By Robert Laurence Binyon%0a%3c %0a%3c "Feel the fury closing in%0a%3c All resistance wearing thin%0a%3c Nowhere to run from all of this havoc%0a%3c Nowhere to hide from all of this madness, madness, madness%0a%3c Madness, madness, madness" - "Madness" by Ruelle%0a%3c %0a%3c "I was listening to the ocean%0a%3c I saw a face in the sand%0a%3c But when I picked it up%0a%3c Then it vanished away from my hands - down...%0a%3c I had a dream I was seven%0a%3c Climbing my way in a tree%0a%3c I saw a piece of heaven%0a%3c Waiting, impatient, for me" - Runaway by Aurora%0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#add8e6%25 "If Emilie and I agree on anything, it's that Max is probably the best of us.
