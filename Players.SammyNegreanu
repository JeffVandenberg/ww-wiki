His clothing usually ranges from sleek, up and coming gangster to stylish street punk, but his black leather jacket is a constant almost in any situation.  Smirking seems to be his default expression, but his eyes are what stand out to most astute observers. Often his easy smile doesn’t ever quite reach his eyes, which are always looking, always assessing.’ %0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25vampire%25Personality%0a%3c %0a%3c Like many Kindred, Harvey is adapt at wearing many masks, but the one most see is a too cool for school smart ass who wears his status as a criminal scumbag like its a badge of honor. He’s a rebel at heart and has little tolerance for traditions, standards, and customs that he deems to be outdate, out of touch, or plain old useless. %0a%3c He’s also developed a reputation as a Kindred who’s loyal and protective to those he chooses to call friend.

Poker in particular is a passion of hers. She's pretty good, but a little too undisciplined to play at the highest levels.  Still, its not hard to find her at a casino or an underground cash game.

Or maybe you could use a dogged and fearless investigator?%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c (:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:cellnr width=100%25:)%0a%3c !!%25mortal%25 Chatter%0a%3c %0a%3c *%25mortal%25 "I am a quote!
