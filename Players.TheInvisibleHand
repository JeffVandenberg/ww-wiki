Many investors who are recruited into the cult had never even heard of the ephemeral before their introduction, and yet the ephemeral is the cornerstone of the organization — the literal Invisible Hand. They worship the predominant spirit in Miami, also known as '''The City Father''', furthering its goals and reaping the rewards that come from doing so. Wealth, power, and occult prominence await those that climb the Invisible Hand's hierarchy, those at the very apex influencing the spirits that govern the ebbs and tides of the city's corporate systems. Perhaps more alluring to some members that climb beyond the first rungs of the ladder is the knowledge and wisdom the spirits of Miami has to offer, shared only to those that are capable of coaxing it from them.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a!!! %25vampire%25 '''Temple:'''%0aNone yet.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a!!! %25vampire%25 '''Methods:'''%0aEverything the Invisible Hand does, it does to further its own agenda, broadening its influence over the spirit realm and the physical realm of Miami. Members are expected to be discrete as to not draw the attention of their competitors or spark rivalries with other factions that delve the Shadow. The lower ranked members are guided on a path of discovery of the ephemeral, but are also expected to contribute on their own part to the cult. Indeed, many Investors are simply that: investors. They provide much needed funds, gaining only tidbits of preternatural insights in return. Yet those that truly aspire, those who seek to understand and manipulate the realm beyond ours, they will truly find bountiful rewards.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a!!! %25vampire%25'''Cult Members'''%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a||!

Many investors who are recruited into the cult had never even heard of the ephemeral before their introduction, and yet the ephemeral is the cornerstone of the organization — the literal Invisible Hand. They worship the predominant spirit in Miami, also known as '''City Father''', furthering its goals and reaping the rewards that come from doing so. Wealth, power, and occult prominence await those that climb the Invisible Hand's hierarchy, those at the very apex influencing the spirits that govern the ebbs and tides of the city's corporate systems. Perhaps more alluring to some members that climb beyond the first rungs of the ladder is the knowledge and wisdom the spirits of Miami has to offer, shared only to those that are capable of coaxing it from them.%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c !!! %25vampire%25 '''Temple:'''%0a%3c None yet.%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c !!! %25vampire%25 '''Methods:'''%0a%3c Everything the Invisible Hand does, it does to further its own agenda, broadening its influence over the spirit realm and the physical realm of Miami. Members are expected to be discrete as to not draw the attention of their competitors or spark rivalries with other factions that delve the Shadow. The lower ranked members are guided on a path of discovery of the ephemeral, but are also expected to contribute on their own part to the cult. Indeed, many Investors are simply that: investors. They provide much needed funds, gaining only tidbits of preternatural insights in return. Yet those that truly aspire, those who seek to understand and manipulate the realm beyond ours, they will truly find bountiful rewards.%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c !!! %25vampire%25'''Cult Members'''%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c ||!
