They blink independently of each other, as if somewhere along the line Boom-Boom got smacked hard and her eyes never worked right again. Her large ears are pierced in several places, as is her septum. She has long swamp-green hair just a few shades darker than her actual skin. Her green lips curve into wide bright smiles whenever she's at work or throwing the things she made, especially when they make a loud 'Boom!Boom!' and especially when they 'Crash!'. She has rows of sharp teeth, ready to rip and tear at anything that touches her without her express permission. She doesn't, somehow despite that, look scary. Instead she looked more like she's an angry toddler. Some of that has to do with the fact that she's not terribly tall. She stands no taller than 5 feet tall, but some of it is the clear goblin-features her keeper forced her into. She couldn't be terrifying, at least until you see her explosions. She's often seen with a porcelain doll mask around her neck, and sometimes she even wears it, hiding those sharp pointy teeth. Almost always she's seen in cloaks and robes, all with thousands of hidden pockets that she fills with things she finds when she's out and about.%0a%0a|| %25color=#66A55C%25Height:||5'0"|| %25color=#5C2982%25Weight:||87lbs|| %25color=#66A55C%25Complexion:||Green|| %25color=#5C2982%25Hair Color:||Green||%0a|| %25color=#66A55C%25Eye Color:||Orange|| %25color=#5C2982%25Apparent Age:||30ish|| %25color=#66A55C%25Age:||65|| %25color=#5C2982%25Accent:||Southern||%0a|| %25color=#66A55C%25Build Type:||Lean|| %25color=#5C2982%25Scars:||Burns|| %25color=#66A55C%25Tattoos:||None || %25color=#5C2982%25Piercings:||Ears, septum||%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/xyNHnX9.png%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #B8860B' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=150px height=150px%25https://i.imgur.com/3TjxJex.jpg%0aSascha is the lesser seen mask side of Boom-Boom. She rarely remembers what her masks' name actually is and even more rarely remembers to answer to it, which is why you might find Killian saying 'Sascha' several times before just giving in and calling her Boom-Boom. It's harder to pin-point Sascha in her mask, what with her hair never being the same. Sometimes it's dark, sometimes it's golden, sometimes it's golden-red, sometimes curled in tight little kinks, sometimes it's loose curls or waves, and other times it's just flowing free as it will. What's ever present are the mischevious green eyes that follow all the movements around her and the ever present smirk, nevermind that you can always spot the girl for her hoodies with many added pockets and her oversize bag where she puts all the little things she collects.%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/nDRUaHg.png%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #B8860B' margin-top=0px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=25px width=200px height=200px%25https://i.imgur.com/3xruUVf.jpg%0aBoom-Boom is a mercurial woman. She lacks any sense of eloquence, but one can almost see where once upon a time she must have had the words to describe the things she could see or do. It's almost heartbreaking, but then one sees the talent she's been gifted with and still retains. Quick-witted and crafty, Boom-Boom never lacks for solutions to problems that she faces. Sure, she tends to think everything is a bomb-worthy problem, but that's what happens when you spend years creating explosives for fun and war. Everything becomes a nail. She's smart but out of place in time, not fully understanding the world she was brought back into. She's quiet save when angered or excited and then she's as loud as can be, yelling at things to work or banging onto them, or reaching excitedly for your sleeve to show you what next is on it's way. She can almost always be found out and about picking up various trinkets, nuts, bolts, and other sorts of 'trash' that she swears will be just what she needs. It's hard to say if any of it actually is.%0a(:div2end:)%0a-----%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/m39g9j2.png%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #B8860B' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=300px height=300px%25https://i.imgur.com/7CDYGIA.png%0a*'''%25color=#66A55C%25Mad Bomber(Changelings)''': Boom-Boom is known in many Changeling circles - especially amongst the summer courtiers, as a bounty hunter with a flare for the explosive.

They blink independently of each other, as if somewhere along the line Boom-Boom got smacked hard and her eyes never worked right again. Her large ears are pierced in several places, as is her septum. She has long swamp-green hair just a few shades darker than her actual skin. Her green lips curve into wide bright smiles whenever she's at work or throwing the things she made, especially when they make a loud 'Boom!Boom!' and especially when they 'Crash!'. She has rows of sharp teeth, ready to rip and tear at anything that touches her without her express permission. She doesn't, somehow despite that, look scary. Instead she looked more like she's an angry toddler. Some of that has to do with the fact that she's not terribly tall. She stands no taller than 5 feet tall, but some of it is the clear goblin-features her keeper forced her into. She couldn't be terrifying, at least until you see her explosions. She's often seen with a porcelain doll mask around her neck, and sometimes she even wears it, hiding those sharp pointy teeth. Almost always she's seen in cloaks and robes, all with thousands of hidden pockets that she fills with things she finds when she's out and about.%0a%3c %0a%3c || %25color=#0094E5%25Height:||5'0"|| %25color=#FF4B0F%25Weight:||87lbs|| %25color=#0094E5%25Complexion:||Green|| %25color=#FF4B0F%25Hair Color:||Green||%0a%3c || %25color=#0094E5%25Eye Color:||Orange|| %25color=#FF4B0F%25Apparent Age:||30ish|| %25color=#0094E5%25Age:||65|| %25color=#FF4B0F%25Accent:||Southern||%0a%3c || %25color=#0094E5%25Build Type:||Lean|| %25color=#FF4B0F%25Scars:||Burns|| %25color=#0094E5%25Tattoos:||None || %25color=#FF4B0F%25Piercings:||Ears, septum||%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25https://i.imgur.com/9nJDOkW.png%0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #8B008B' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=150px height=150px%25https://i.imgur.com/3TjxJex.jpg%0a%3c Sascha is the lesser seen mask side of Boom-Boom. She rarely remembers what her masks' name actually is and even more rarely remembers to answer to it, which is why you might find Killian saying 'Sascha' several times before just giving in and calling her Boom-Boom. It's harder to pin-point Sascha in her mask, what with her hair never being the same. Sometimes it's dark, sometimes it's golden, sometimes it's golden-red, sometimes curled in tight little kinks, sometimes it's loose curls or waves, and other times it's just flowing free as it will. What's ever present are the mischevious green eyes that follow all the movements around her and the ever present smirk, nevermind that you can always spot the girl for her hoodies with many added pockets and her oversize bag where she puts all the little things she collects.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25https://i.imgur.com/bR5f4pq.png%0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #8B008B' margin-top=0px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=25px width=200px height=200px%25https://i.imgur.com/3xruUVf.jpg%0a%3c Boom-Boom is a mercurial woman.
