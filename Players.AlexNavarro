Her eyes are set close, brown, her chin weak and her face rounded. She has long light brown haired kept up in a bun usually, a warm skin tone and a long and defined nose. She often has black framed glasses resting on her nose or pushed up onto her forehead and, still as often, dangling from her mouth. Her build is small, healthy, but nothing impressive and quite unintimidating. Alex dresses contemporary, flattering to her figure, shirts or sweaters and jeans or skirts, usually knee length, or dresses, much the same. She typically is clean, groomed, with modest amounts of makeup. The only regular in the aesthetic are her glasses and a well worn crossbody bag. Alex holds herself close, quite literally often holding one arm around her mid and the other hovering around her face, playing with an earlobe or holding her glasses as she bites the end of them. This comes across more as distracted, or in thought, rather than shy or meek. Alejandra is quite open and friendly, gregarious though reserved. A good word to describe her is ‘quiet’. She speaks softly and often has to be told to speak up. Even her steps are quiet, accidentally sneaking up on people. She has a very slight southern accent when speaking English and, when speaking Spanish, her accent is noticeably European, complete with a lisp. She speaks both fluently, flawlessly, and natively.%0a%0a----%0a(:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a(:cellnr width=100%25:)%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/3XIRMjG.jpg ||%25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/6EaCVMe.jpg || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/zBVrnPM.jpg || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/tXaOIdz.jpg || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/O6Gymia.jpg || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/DMbWSX3.jpg ||%0a(:tableend:)%0a----%0a!!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Manuela Navarro'''%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/JhXzCJG.jpg%0a%25center%25Alex's grandmother and roommate, Manuela is a small Spanish woman with auburn hair and an infectious smile.
