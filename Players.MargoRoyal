One of those looks that appears effortless, but is anything but. Her clothing is on the expensive side, but not over the top. She would never show up over or under dressed to anything. Doomed to be noticed due to those features, she is very beautiful in a sultry and mysterious way. A certain magnetism that draws others in.%0a!!%25center%25https://i.ibb.co/4t7jbBV/background2.png%0a%25center%25Margo grew up in Miami. Definitely not with the upper crust that she is with now. She worked her way up from nothing. She is proud of that fact. From small gossip columnist all the way up to a freelance investigative reporter. Her time is truly her own. She is her own boss now.  Literally a phone call and her story will feature in print media far and wide. Well respected journalist. %0a%0aFor those with Underworld Ties the rumors are dark. She dated 'Mr. Big' a man with quite the reputation. A serious part of the illegal landscape of Miami. She was the woman on his arm for quite awhile, but recently they split, and then the man himself demanded his beautiful wife come home and make a society wedding out of what was supposed to be an annulment. Not More than one week after the wedding both Elias Nilsson and his brother and partner in crime Olivar Nilsson were murdered at a night club opening that Margo was performing at. No one believes this was a coincidence. The truth however? Is far darker than anyone could ever imagine. %0a%0a%25center%25https://i.ibb.co/Hn6wbbD/beauty.jpg%0a%0a%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a%0a----%0a!!%25center%25https://i.ibb.co/g3PC2Ph/hooks2.png%0a!!!!%25werewolf%25 ''Media (Status 1)'': %0aMargo is a well respected investigative journalist. Perhaps you have worked with her before? Or were you the one she wrote something about? From her fingertips to page six, baby. Got a juicy tip about someone you want exposed and don't wanna take the fall for it? She is always ready with a drink and a willing ear. %0a%0a!!!!%25werewolf%25 ''Underworld Ties (Shady Folks)'': %0aMargo gets involved with all types of people. One in particular was a romantic mistake. He was a big dude too. Perhaps you know she slipped to the shadier side of life more than a few times. Wanna add to her black book, hon?%0a%0a!!!!%25werewolf%25 ''Call the fucking cops, I don't care! (Law Enforcement- Allies 2)'': %0aChances are you've seen her press pass up close and personal. She put a few politicians into hot water, exposing them for their misdeeds on more than one occasion. A known social justice warrior, though you suspect her motives, the results are undeniable. Maybe you worked a case she was covering? %0a%0a!!!!%25werewolf%25 ''Local (Anyone)''%0aMargo was born and raised in Miami. Middle Lower class, she had a reputation in high school for knowing everything about everyone, and only used this information if people fucked with her, or fucked with people she cared about, or didn't think deserved it. She socially destroyed more people in high school than anyone else, but largely spent most of her time alone. She is a literal rags to riches story. %0a%0a!!!!%25werewolf%25 The Ties That Bind (Supernatural)%0aMargo is claimed by the Crimson Lance of Summer, [[Ascian Beng]]. No one wants to anger a Bronze God right? Right?! Then to try to coerce or bind Margo using supernatural powers, against her will is an exercise in suicidal stupidity. %0a%0a!!!!%25werewolf%25 Fresh Meat (Uratha/Wolf-Blooded)%0aMargo was bitten and tortured with lunacy until Luna blessed her with her madness. Margo paid the price in anguish, flesh, bone, and blood. It is known that Margo plotted and executed the brutal murder of the two responsible for this event. She kept the hands of one of her assailants. %0a%0a!!!!%25werewolf%25 Candidate For Embrace and known Blood Doll (Vampire)%0aMargo has drawn the attention of the local court as a human to watch for embrace. She had previously been the Blood Doll of [[John Murphy]], and it is known he is watching her with the intent to embrace her. %0a%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a%0a----%0a!!%25center%25%25Werewolf%25'''https://i.ibb.co/52dM5Hh/contacts2.png'''%0a%0a||! %25werewolf%25[[AscianBeng|Ascian]] ||! %25werewolf%25[[VieveFairchildMoore|Vivi]] ||! %25werewolf%25[[KnoxFairchildMoore|Knox]] ||! %25werewolf%25[[MaricelaDeSola|Maricela]] ||%0a||! https://i.ibb.co/fGTWhwF/ascian.jpg||! https://i.ibb.co/JQjB9d4/vivi.png||! https://i.ibb.co/5LxF9W6/knox.jpg||! https://i.ibb.co/PMBL9dC/maricela2.jpg||%0a||!

I do not say lonely — at least, not all the time — but essentially, and finally, alone. This is what makes your self-respect so important, and I don’t see how you can respect yourself if you must look in the hearts and minds of others for your happiness." -Margo \\%0a%0a%0a%25werewolf%25 "This is a prophecy: Her path will twist and wind, always determined by someone or something else. She spins from the claws of one monster into the jaws of another. Clever, she will always escape them, though just barely. At last, when she thinks herself nearest to freedom, she will face the inescapable monstrosity inside her own soul." -- [[John Murphy]] \\%0a%0a%0a%25werewolf%25 "We measured the risk, and decided the reward's worth it. But here's the thing: you might be underestimating the risk. Maybe I am too. One thing's for sure, finding out will be one hell of a ride. Here's to mixing crazy with dangerous." -[[Clyde Marlowe]] \\%0a%0a%0a%25werewolf%25 "When we see us in the mirror it is the only time we can see ourselves as a whole, what others think we are and what we think. There is this wish inside of us to find someone who is able to do this magic, but most people can't even see through there own mirror, cause there are blinded by themselves." -[[AuroravonTannenried|Aurora]]%0a%0a%25werewolf%25 "She reminds me of a couple folks from back home.  Those that couldn't let a stray thread sit, so they'd tug and pull at it.  I just hope the thread she's pulling doesn't unravel her, in the process." -[[KnoxFairchildMoore|Knox]]%0a%0a%25werewolf%25 "She is gonna be soooo pissed when she figures it out.  Until then, I'll be keeping an eye on this little sister." -[[JeremiasNunez|Jere]]%0a%0a%25werewolf%25 "'They say I'm a beast. And feast upon it. When all along I thought that's what a woman was. They say I'm a bitch. Or witch. I've claimed the same and never winced.'

Her green eyes almost always seem to be searching for something, as if she were reading the world itself like a book.  In conversation, she goes from extremely focused to far off.  She has a small tattoo on her left wrist in red ink: "DO NOT MRI - SHRAP"%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Background'''%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25Lyra was born and raised in Hialeah, growing up to a struggling working-class family.  She fixed up an old computer she found in a dumpster because her parents couldn't afford one.  With few options after high school, she joined the Army to help pay for college so she could go into robotics in hopes of pioneering in cybernetics.  Her career there suffered an abrupt end, but she still had her GI Bill, and managed to get into University of Miami, graduating shortly after with top marks.  Now, she runs a small robotics repair and custom robotic design business.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25 https://i.imgur.com/rYiUThf.gif \%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c (:div2end:)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Contacts'''%0a%3c %0a%3c ||! %25mortal%25Image ||! %25mortal%25Name ||! %25mortal%25Relationship ||! %25mortal%25Comment ||! %25mortal%25Ringtone ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.pinimg.com/originals/21/0b/0b/210b0be9e6c2890fa700ec8c5619eb5e.jpg || %25beast%25[[Jeremias Nunez]] || %25beast%25Boyfriend || %25beast%25The only one who's seen me at my worst. || %25newwin%25[[https://youtu.be/GC_mV1IpjWA|%25beast%25"Under the Sea"]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://alchetron.com/cdn/doctor-sivana-36946980-08e1-4ef2-8e73-4305f437756-resize-750.jpg || %25changeling%25[[Solomon Reed]] || %25changeling%25Mentor || %25changeling%25If I can impress this guy, I can impress anyone, I think. || %25newwin%25[[https://youtu.be/Jm-upHSP9KU|%25changeling%25"Weird Science"]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/qYXiTus.jpg || %25beast%25[[Travis Mello]] || %25beast%25Friend || %25beast%25I ain't never had a friend like him. || %25newwin%25[[https://youtu.be/aEryAoLfnAA|%25beast%25"Prince Ali"]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/t2qnRla.jpg || %25changeling%25[[Ascian Beng]] || %25changeling%25Friend || %25changeling%25First impressions: He's a big guy, but he's an even bigger man. || %25newwin%25[[https://youtu.be/KjNn9_bfp6k|%25changeling%25"Walk Tall"]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://imgur.com/lINx8yO.jpg || %25werewolf%25[[Tempest Pax]] || %25werewolf%25Business Associates || %25werewolf%25Impressive lady, very different from me, I think.
