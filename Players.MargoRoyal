One of those looks that appears effortless, but is anything but. Her clothing is on the expensive side, but not over the top. She would never show up over or under dressed to anything. Doomed to be noticed due to those features, she is very beautiful in a sultry and mysterious way. A certain magnetism that draws others in.%0a!!%25center%25https://i.ibb.co/CJL4W6j/background.png%0a%0a%25center%25Margo grew up in Miami. Definitely not with the upper crust that she is with now. She worked her way up from nothing. She is proud of that fact. From small gossip columnist all the way up to a freelance investigative reporter. Her time is truly her own. She is her own boss now.  Literally a phone call and her story will feature in print media far and wide. Well respected journalist. %0a%0aFor those with Underworld Ties the rumors are dark. She dated 'Mr. Big' a man with quite the reputation. A serious part of the illegal landscape of Miami. She was the woman on his arm for quite awhile, but recently they split, and then the man himself demanded his beautiful wife come home and make a society wedding out of what was supposed to be an annulment. So far it appears Margo is complying to her husbands wishes. %0a%0a%25center%25https://i.ibb.co/88f4CDJ/margoandbigrude.gif%0a%0a%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a%0a----%0a!!%25center%25https://i.ibb.co/MMWGgf6/hooks.png%0a%0a!!!!%25mortal%25 ''Media (Status 1)'': %0aMargo is a well respected investigative journalist. Perhaps you have worked with her before? Or were you the one she wrote something about? From her fingertips to page six, baby. Got a juicy tip about someone you want exposed and don't wanna take the fall for it? She is always ready with a drink and a willing ear. %0a%0a!!!!%25mortal%25 ''Underworld Ties (Shady Folks)'': %0aMargo gets involved with all types of people. One in particular was a romantic mistake. He was a big dude too. Perhaps you know she slipped to the shadier side of life more than a few times. Wanna add to her black book, hon?%0a%0a!!!!%25mortal%25 ''Call the fucking cops, I don't care! (Law Enforcement- Allies 2)'': %0aChances are you've seen her press pass up close and personal. She put a few politicians into hot water, exposing them for their misdeeds on more than one occasion. A known social justice warrior, though you suspect her motives, the results are undeniable. Maybe you worked a case she was covering? %0a%0a!!!!%25mortal%25 ''Local (Anyone)'':%0aMargo was born and raised in Miami. Middle Lower class, she had a reputation in high school for knowing everything about everyone, and only used this information if people fucked with her, or fucked with people she cared about, or didn't think deserved it. She socially destroyed more people in high school than anyone else, but largely spent most of her time alone. She is a literal rags to riches story. %0a%0a!!!!%25mortal%25 The Ties That Bind (Supernatural)%0aMargo is claimed by the Crimson Lance of Summer, [[Ascian Beng]]. No one wants to anger a Bronze God right? Right?! Then to try to coerce or bind Margo against her will is an exercise in suicidal stupidity. %0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a(:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a%0a(:cellnr width=100%25:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25https://i.ibb.co/gm2VyNN/quotes.png%0a%0a%25mortal%25 “We are all alone, born alone, die alone, and — in spite of True Romance magazines — we shall all someday look back on our lives and see that, in spite of our company, we were alone the whole way. I do not say lonely — at least, not all the time — but essentially, and finally, alone. This is what makes your self-respect so important, and I don’t see how you can respect yourself if you must look in the hearts and minds of others for your happiness." -Margo \\%0a%0a%0a%25vampire%25 "In Atlanta in about '93 I had to beat some Serpent into torpor for taking a childe without the Prince's sanction. She begged me--she told me she ''had'' to Embrace him, that he ''needed'' to be Kindred. If I had known Margo then, I might have let the Daeva go." -- [[John Murphy]] \\%0a%0a%0a%25vampire%25 "We measured the risk, and decided the reward's worth it. But here's the thing: you might be underestimating the risk. Maybe I am too. One thing's for sure, finding out will be one hell of a ride. Here's to mixing crazy with dangerous." -[[Clyde Marlowe]] \\%0a%0a%0a%25mortal%25 "When we see us in the mirror it is the only time we can see ourselves as a whole, what others think we are and what we think. There is this wish inside of us to find someone who is able to do this magic, but most people can't even see through there own mirror, cause there are blinded by themselves." -[[AuroravonTannenried|Aurora]]%0a%0a%25werewolf%25 "She reminds me of a couple folks from back home.  Those that couldn't let a stray thread sit, so they'd tug and pull at it.  I just hope the thread she's pulling doesn't unravel her, in the process." -[[KnoxFairchildMoore|Knox]]%0a%0a%25beast%25 "She is gonna be soooo pissed when she figures it out.

Middle Lower class, she had a reputation in high school for knowing everything about everyone, and only used this information if people fucked with her, or fucked with people she cared about, or didn't think deserved it. She socially destroyed more people in high school than anyone else, but largely spent most of her time alone. She is a literal rags to riches story. %0a
