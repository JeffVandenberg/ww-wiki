He carries himself lazily until something excites him, and then he's a bundle of barely contained energy. His hair is usually kept short, and he tries to stay on top of shaving every so often. His frame is thin, if not outright skinny, although that wiry frame of his has strength to it. His dark brown skin is covered in a few scars here and there, and betrays a rather active lifestyle. Stevie tends to stick to darker colors, and dresses as best he can for the occasion.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Mein''%0a%0aSteven looks nearly as much bird as he does man. He's covered in soft feathers mottled brown, grey, and white. His face and neck are the only things a solid color, and they're a stark white that tends to stand out. His eyes are a stark yellow; and just below that his nose, lips, and mouth have formed into a short, curved, down-ward facing beak. When he's barefoot (which is often if he can help it) he can show off three-toed feet that end in deadly talons.%0a%0a%25center%25%0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Mantle''%0a%0a%25center%25A sense of the unseen and unknown.
