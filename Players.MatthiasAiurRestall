After all, who wants to settle into a new place and be working every minute of every day. His bright blue eyes have got a pension for framing a shot and if it's not a snap on his phone, he's got a nice camera around here somewhere. An avid jogger, the man runs for the sake of running, it's a way to get away, to go into his own world, never really following the same trail, which might make more sense to some than to others. At the end of the day he's just as likely to end up in the water as the woods, enjoying the depths and flow of currents.%0a%0a%25mage%25 His style swings wildly but more often than not he'll be wearing shorts hung just down his knees, a t-shirt that shows off part of his sleeve. When he wears more formal attire, he eschews a tie unless called for and even then he's liable to ignore the standards altogether. His perhaps most identifiable mark is the tattoo that runs from his pectoral over his shoulder and down his arm with its symbols of the sun, moon, and stranger things still. There is definitely something to it, but the man doesn't usually comment.%0a%0a%0a!%25mage%25 Nimbus, Supernal Influences:%0a%0a'''%25mage%25The Long-Term: Supernal Warping and the Influence of Symbols'''\\%0a%25mage%25Crystals, harmonics, and the nature of systems reverberate through channels and pathways as structures align in ways idealized for their purposes. This structure is orderly in seeming contradiction to the man from who it emanates. Nonsensical at times, but its benefits can not be denied. Run longer and you don't notice the time, the aches and fatigue don't come while the time slips past, efficiency, point A to B, timed by your watch, it ensures you get where you're going if you put in a little bit of effort, but you might miss it if you look away. Be careful in your wandering, efficiency isn't always what you think it is. Nothing worse than waiting for ten extra minutes in a waiting room with screaming children all because you got there earlier than you thought.%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=17px margin-right=16px margin-bottom=0px width=380 newwin%25https://i.imgur.com/tIoHkzU.jpg%0a'''%25mage%25The Immediate: Supernal Aura and the Influence of Truth'''\\%0a%25mage%25Reality vibrates and the vibrations ripple outward, you can feel them, you can sense them, you can see the structure of it unfolding in fractal multidimensional spaces and it is not comfortable. It reminds you that even the smallest of things are greater than any single person if you let them be. We are small and large in equal measure and it is our choice to choose which we are in any given moment. The randomness breaks down, the sense of things becomes lost in the absolute permanence of what is perfect and imperishable. Chaos falls apart and Order prevails, oppressive and all consuming as it locks you into phase with the world. Yet, you must see the Order to disrupt it.%0a%0a'''%25mage%25The Signature: Supernal Echoes and the Influence of Will'''\\%0a%25mage%25The crystalline structures develop and align, perfected multilayered symmetries, that develop webs and pathways and orderly forces that when shifted from the method fall apart and shatter, rendering a chaos that is aching to be freed. A balance is found in the cracks and lines of platonic ideals and geometries that are revealed as the simplest of things display not themselves to inquisitive senses but instead a platonic ideal formed of Aiur's sensibilities. It is not supernal reality. It is his reality, substituted in place of your own.%0a%0a'''%25mage%25The Tilt: Supernal Corruption and the Influence of Power'''\\%0a%25mage%25He gets inside your head, the patterns start making sense. The reactions and catalysts become clear, following the trains of thought and progress one achieves an understanding of the arts and sciences, mystical and physical. You understand they can not be separated as the crystalline structures of your new found multidimensional self strives to follow his edicts, to be more efficient, more perfect, to attain the right and proper way of the world.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a!%25mage%25 Moving Circles, People to Know:%0a%0a(:table:)%0a(:cellnr width=50%25 align=left style='padding-right: 10px;':)%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px width=175%25https://i.imgur.com/BxorJWK.jpg%0a%25mortal%25'''[[Siobhan Prince|Siobh]]'''\\%0a%25mortal%25 Family...

It's the places. He'll pause in his footsteps, and look off into the distance. Waiting as though he can already see the shadows cast from the sun in another place, how it will change the world into something magick. He's at least got some self preservation and common sense. He waits to rush out into traffic until the time is right to get the shot... but he will take those steps in search of what he's looking. All in search of a perfection and dedication to his art.%0a%0a%25mage%25  '''Runner's High (Anyone):'''\\%0a%25mage%25  Jogging is all well and good, but running is its own thing. It is euphoric and transcendent. It is the means by which we tired predators that were faster, that were stronger. We do not tire like other beasts. It's just who we are. Running for him isn't enough... The world we have built rises higher than anything before it but the mountains of the living earth... Free running isn't about avoid obstacles, it welcomes them, from the scaling of buildings to the controlled falls and leaps to simply lunging over park benches to tumble and roll keeping the momentum.%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=7px margin-right=16px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=8px width=350 newwin%25https://i.imgur.com/8cWmnPv.jpg%0a%25mage%25  '''The Places Between (Traveller):'''\\%0a%25mage%25  Life is a journey with a beginning and an end. All of the somethings are filled with so much more than nothing and even the nothing is filled with a place. This place exists everywhere and we ignore it for the way we're all going about our lives; this edge of our world and Matthias brushes against it every time he travels, seeking some final horizon to stand upon and gaze out across. Layers upon layers of this place and it is perhaps the last layer before you reach nothing and everything itself and that Place Between makes it a special place. He isn't yet sure what he will find there... Only that he will find something in its liminal space.%0a%0a%25mage%25  '''Order and Chaos (Mages):'''\\%0a%25mage%25  Embrace the Chaos... No... not the Abyss... the Abyss has no love for our world... it has no love for you.  It is a place of constant change and when everything changes nothing changes. This world right here, all about us, is made for us and us for it. The Supernal is no more welcoming than the sifting chaos of what would be for any one of us Oblivion. That's the foundation of this one's ideas. That this is the world that matters, that everything is right here, shape it, change it... It is us.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a(:tableend:)%0a%0a!%25mage%25 More or Less than a Mask:%0a(:table:)%0a(:cellnr align=center style='padding-right: 10px;':)%0a[[https://i.imgur.com/7yEJRWj.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/7yEJRWjb.jpg"Tranceur"]]%0a(:cell align=center style='padding-right: 10px;':)%0a[[https://i.imgur.com/KRbgZzb.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/KRbgZzbb.jpg"Sunshades"]]%0a(:cell align=center style='padding-right: 10px;':)%0a[[https://i.imgur.com/egdx7hj.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/egdx7hjb.jpg"Pillow"]]%0a(:cell align=center style='padding-right: 10px;':)%0a[[https://i.imgur.com/ciPSjbN.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/ciPSjbNb.jpg"Rooftop"]]%0a(:cell align=center style='padding-right: 10px;':)%0a[[https://i.imgur.com/ErE60oA.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/ErE60oAb.jpg"Open"]]%0a(:cellnr align=center style='padding-right: 10px;':)[[https://i.imgur.com/nM7YBPs.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/nM7YBPsb.jpg"Pool"]]%0a(:cell align=center style='padding-right: 10px;':)[[https://i.imgur.com/QRE89p1.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/QRE89p1b.jpg"Cafe"]]%0a(:cell align=center style='padding-right: 10px;':)%0a[[https://i.imgur.com/yfEAlTP.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/yfEAlTPb.jpg"Suit"]]%0a(:cell align=center style='padding-right: 10px;':)[[https://i.imgur.com/PpAlxWd.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/PpAlxWdb.jpg"Canal"]]%0a(:cell align=center style='padding-right: 10px;':)%0a[[https://i.imgur.com/hxFHpx8.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/hxFHpx8b.jpg"Denim"]]%0a(:cellnr align=center style='padding-right: 10px;':)[[https://i.imgur.com/GzndXDV.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/GzndXDVb.jpg"Bubbles!"]]%0a(:cell align=center style='padding-right: 10px;':)[[https://i.imgur.com/xHiPHP9.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/xHiPHP9b.jpg"Driving"]]%0a(:cell align=center style='padding-right: 10px;':)[[https://i.imgur.com/L8rgfdf.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/L8rgfdfb.jpg"Waking Up"]]%0a(:cell align=center style='padding-right: 10px;':)[[https://i.imgur.com/PXTgfiT.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/PXTgfiTb.jpg"Construction"]]%0a(:cell align=center style='padding-right: 10px;':)[[https://i.imgur.com/xsyBmBl.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/xsyBmBlb.jpg"Bounce"]]%0a(:cellnr align=center style='padding-right: 10px;':)[[https://i.imgur.com/V3D3O2m.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/V3D3O2mb.jpg"Gallery"]]%0a(:cell align=center style='padding-right: 10px;':)[[https://i.imgur.com/OuQp7Aw.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/OuQp7Awb.jpg"Dam"]]%0a(:cell align=center style='padding-right: 10px;':)[[https://i.imgur.com/nYWNjWa.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/nYWNjWab.jpg"Uhh..."]]%0a(:cell align=center style='padding-right: 10px;':)%0a[[https://i.imgur.com/iJQaFJ0.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/iJQaFJ0b.jpg"Bench"]]%0a(:cell align=center style='padding-right: 10px;':)[[https://i.imgur.com/CdUgWMD.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/CdUgWMDb.jpg"Rest"]]%0a(:cellnr align=center style='padding-right: 10px;':)[[https://i.imgur.com/yDP2N1o.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/yDP2N1ob.jpg"Trance"]]%0a(:cell align=center style='padding-right: 10px;':)[[https://i.imgur.com/X6NoRBZ.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/X6NoRBZb.jpg"Pier"]]%0a(:cell align=center style='padding-right: 10px;':)[[https://i.imgur.com/OmEAWr6.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/OmEAWr6b.jpg"Fur Collar"]]%0a(:cell align=center style='padding-right: 10px;':)[[https://i.imgur.com/71AFUCe.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/71AFUCeb.jpg"Winter"]]%0a(:cell align=center style='padding-right: 10px;':)%0a[[https://i.imgur.com/nTSEmZc.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/nTSEmZcb.jpg"Mystery"]]%0a(:cellnr align=center style='padding-right: 10px;':)%0a[[https://i.imgur.com/XfHlqBy.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/XfHlqByb.jpg"Ruins"]]%0a(:cell align=center style='padding-right: 10px;':)%0a[[https://i.imgur.com/uSdKB9H.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/uSdKB9Hb.jpg"Casual"]]%0a(:cell align=center style='padding-right: 10px;':)%0a[[https://i.imgur.com/teRg2pQ.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/teRg2pQb.jpg"Tracks"]]%0a(:cell align=center style='padding-right: 10px;':)[[https://i.imgur.com/PkQUTTq.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/PkQUTTqb.jpg"Sweater Scarf"]]%0a(:cell align=center style='padding-right: 10px;':)%0a[[https://i.imgur.com/8GD9A9Q.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/8GD9A9Qb.jpg"Forward"]] %0a(:tableend:) %0a%0a%0a%25center%25%0a%0a!%25mage%25 Words Spoken, Sometimes Heard:%0a%0a%25mage%25 ''"And if this sounds too abstract to be useful, then you're thinking about it too hard."'' - M20 Core \\%0a\\%0a%25werewolf%25 "Another condescending umma, trying to butt in where he doesn't belong." - [[Charles Kirk]]\\%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a(:tableend:)%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/LvwjqKf.jpg%0a%0a(:include GameRef.Directoryplayermage:)

This structure is orderly in seeming contradiction to the man from who it emanates. Nonsensical at times, but its benefits can not be denied. Run longer and you don't notice the time, the aches and fatigue don't come while the time slips past, efficiency, point A to B, timed by your watch, it ensures you get where you're going if you put in a little bit of effort, but you might miss it if you look away.

After all, who wants to settle into a new place and be working every minute of every day. His bright blue eyes have got a pension for framing a shot and if it's not a snap on his phone, he's got a nice camera around here somewhere. An avid jogger, the man runs for the sake of running, it's a way to get away, to go into his own world, never really following the same trail, which might make more sense to some than to others. Really at the end of the day he's just as likely to end up in the water, moving about and in some ways the man is most at peace here, enjoying the depths and flow of currents.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25mage%25 His style swings wildly but more often than not he'll be wearing shorts hung just down his knees, a t-shirt that shows off part of his sleeve. When he wears more formal attire, he eschews a tie unless called for and even then he's liable to ignore the standards altogether. His perhaps most identifiable mark isthe tattoo that runs from his pectoral over his shoulder and down his arm with its symbols of the sun, moon, and stranger things still. There is definitely something to it, but the man doesn't usually comment.%0a---%0a> %25mage%25 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
