While some people carry themselves with flair or authority, forcing eyes to attract to them, Anahita simply is. The nature of her ghoulish state has left her with some interesting side effects that to some are absolutely delightful and to others downright uncomfortable. Simply looking at her is enough to invite thoughts of carnal sin even in more chaste people, like a supernatural urge of desire and want radiating from her very being. Once she starts putting effort into it only the most dedicated and resolved of people could resist making advances upon her.%0a%0aIvory skin contrasts raven hair and even without the unfortunate effects of her ghouling she'd still be pleasant to rest the gaze upon. Large, intense eyes curiously inspect the world around her and she seems comfortable in most settings. Unless she is in an appropriate environment, like a night-club, she does her best to subdue the nature of her being, but it is quite difficult. Generally she will carry herself with a decent amount of poise and keep her chin held high as if certain of her own self-worth.%0a%0aShe stands at around 5.9 feet or so, decently tall by American standards, but her build is slim. While far from unathletic, she is quite lithe and doesn't seem to quite any punch in her arms. She speaks with just the slightest hint of an accent.%0a%0a%0a!! %25vampire%25 '''+History & Past+'''%0a----%0aAnahita is a bit of a mystery to most people, at least when it comes to distant past. Her accent (and looks, and name...) suggest a Persian, probably Iranian, background but of what generation is hard to tell. Anyone taking the time to study her past would run into quite a few barriers, preventing them from finding any sort of truth. The public records at least it reads that she was born in the mid-nineties in the state of New York, where she studied and ended up with a bachelor's degree in Business Administration. She has no living family members. This all seems like a very... convenvient explanation, however.%0a%0a!!! %25vampire%25 Recent History:%0aWhile she has been in Miami on extended visits in the past, her staying and living in Miami begun somewhere in late March of 2019 when she moved into the city. It didn't take her long to find a job, surprisingly easy, at the Miami PD as a secretary for the Executive Officer, a fairly highly ranked member of the police organization. From his side, she has done her best to leave an impression and make friends at the Police District. %0a%0a!! %25vampire%25 '''+Roleplaying Hooks+'''%0a-----%0a!!!!! %25vampire%25 '''Stolen property''' (Any but especially Invictus): %0a%0a%25%25 Details are unclear, but one thing is for certain: Anahita's current domitor was not the one to ghoul her. And judging from the way she carries herself and the way she talks, she most certainly isn't Carthian 'by birth'. For Kindred with a little bit of politics/contacts/status with the Invictus, it is possible they know a little bit more than just some hazy rumors. Anahita allegedly belonged to some important Invictus Kindred up until fairly recently, when her former domitor was beaten into the dirt and Anahita was promptly stolen. If you are an Invictus who spent any time... anywhere in the US, there's a chance you ran into her in the past. PM for more details.%0a%0a!!!!! %25vampire%25 '''The meek and lowly''' (Ghouls, Former ghouls): %0a%0a%25%25 Not truly kindred and not really human it is hard to find people to socialize with where you can truly be yourself... Unless you find others just like you. Anahita has always had an easy time entertaining herself with her fellow ghouls and sometimes if those ghouls end up embraced, the relationship still stands. Or at least the memory of it. Friends in high places indeed...!%0a%0a!!!!! %25vampire%25 '''The embarrassing ghoul''' (Kindred, Carthians): %0a%0a%25%25 She isn't used to the 'standard' provided by Carthian gatherings. Sometimes she makes her contempt known, in public, having loud arguments with her domitor about the choice of music, about the attire worn or how cold it is in the room. Needless to say, she is a bit too posh to hang out in some biker bar and being offered -yuck- beer. Eventually, she backs down, but never without having made sure everyone around her feels embarrassed. %0a%0a!!!!! %25mortal%25 '''Good morning officer!''' (Police, Media):%0a%25%25 Anahita has been employed by the Miami PD since the early summer of 2019, in a civilian role. By now she's a decently known face in the MPD administration, always polite and very friendly to her co-workers. She is the personal secretary of the Executive Officer who travels a lot in between the various districts, sitting in long-winded meetings with everything ranging from beat cops to the captains themselves. She also answers all his calls, most of his emails and arranges his daily meetings, which allows her to interact every now and then with local journalists and other representatives of media.%0a%0a!!!!! %25mortal%25 '''Work ethic''' (Police):%0a%25%25 Do you work at the police district? Do you have anything at all that Anahita could want from you? Are you in any way or shape attracted to women in their twenties? Odds are Anahita made her moves on you (or you felt compelled to move in on her, she is very good at making sure you think it was your idea...) and judging from her track record, you probably boinked. She is incredibly talented when it comes to dragging people into bed. The nature of the exchange varies from time to time as it is sometimes simply to establish amicable terms with someone whom she might need favors from one day... While others are more sinister, making sure she collects photographic evidence of the act in order to build up blackmail material against you, in case she ever REALLY needs that favor. She has yet to collect anything, but who knows what the future will bring?%0a%0a!!!!! %25mortal%25 '''Performer''' (Music, Entertainers, Artists, Anyone):%0a%25%25 Whatever spare time Anahita might have she likes to spend creating art and to hang out with fellow artists. Painting, playing music, dancing, singing and even writing poems. Very few items are out of reach for Anahita's interests and she seems especially starved of them ever since arriving in Miami in early 2019. She attends seminars, open culture houses and has looked for the chance to perform, although not necessarily on a stage. She'd be just as happy to partake in poetry slam as she'd be to just sing karaoke in someone's garage.%0a%0a!!!!! %25mortal%25 '''Secular Muslim''' (Muslims):%0a%25%25 Anahita hasn't been a true believer for as long as she can remember, but while she doesn't partake in active religious life most of the time, she does visit the mosque every now and then. Because traditions are traditions and they help you feel just a little bit more normal, which can be a bit of a blessing. As she attends she is often donning a stylish %25newwin%25 [[https://i.imgur.com/Hs32FPT.jpg|dupatta]] veil, seeking out other attendants of her own age and chit-chatting about this and that.%0a%0a(:tableend:)%0a%0a!! %25vampire%25 '''+Allies, Contacts & Retainers+'''%0a-----%0aFor as long as Anahita as attended social events, it is no wonder she has met a number of interesting people along the way...%0a%0a%0a(:cellnr width=50%25 align=left style='padding-left: 0px;':)%0a%25lfloat text-align=center width=180 margin-top=0px margin-right=7px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=8px newwin%25 [[https://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/Players/AnaMarielaCastillo|https://i.imgur.com/MGxu49A.jpg]] %25mortal%25 '''The Target:'''%0a%0a%25mortal%25 You are someone she wants, but has been unable to grab a hold of.
