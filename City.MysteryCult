The building, also referred to as The Co-Op, is a stone affair, and is kept well protected by the members of the Co-Op. The group’s members are all members of the supernatural community dedicated to working together towards their individual goals as well as towards the common good of the Co-Op. Members are expected not just to tolerate or be kind to one another, but to cooperate with and help each other. The general belief of the Co-Op’s members is that there is strength to be found in unity and diversity. It is not uncommon for members to help each other with projects, research, or job searches.%0a%0aThe building itself aids the Co-Op in it’s mission. The Co-Op benefits from its members living in a single building, thus reinforcing the close bonds formed between the members. Given the diverse needs of its membership, the Co-Op succeeds in large part due to the efforts of the mage and changeling who first struck a bargain in the creation of the building. The changeling and the Mastigos worked together to tie the building’s apartment doors to both the hedge and remote locations of the fallen world. While the actual details of the building’s creation are complex, the results are less so, although no less wondrous. The door to each member’s apartment, when opened with their key, leads to a living area best suited to their needs. For changelings this could be a hollow in the hedge, for a mage it could be a remote basement study with a small hallow, vampire’s rooms are almost universally havens away from any threat of sunlight, while some werewolves find forested dens guarding loci. Each ‘apartment’ is bounded by space magic, so that the only way in or out of the area is through the apartment door (although rarely the Hedge manages to shift a trod into the living area, such trods are almost always simply walking paths that loop back to the same living area). While not exactly common, it is neither rare for a minor spirit or an experiment-gone-awry to escape someone’s apartment and pass through the halls of the Co-Op. Usually the intruder is stopped my supernatural defenses, or else by other members. Such disruptions are minor, but keep things interesting in the day-to-day. Fortunately, the building also prevents pure mortals from noticing or remembering the odd goings-on in the main areas.%0a%0aAs members become more well-known and earn renown among their peers for their helpfulness to the other members, they often become a bit more entrenched in supernatural affairs, and it becomes necessary to either separate their mortal and supernatural identities, or else to strengthen their bond to their humanity so as to maintain the balance needed to live such a life with their morals and sanity intact. Eventually the most notable members manage to collect trinkets and items of power from their fellow Co-Op members, and even learn to activate those items with their own internal powers as they internalize some of the diversity of their group.%0a%0aPurpose%0aThe Co-op is a group dedicated to aiding one another to mutual benefit. Living proof that the whole can be more than the sum of it’s parts, the Co-Op is made of members determined to use their unique talents, insights, and abilities, to aid those who have pledged themselves to do the same. In doing so, members not only excel in their own endeavors, but learn more about the other factions as well.%0a%0aRelic%0aMuch of the Co-Op focuses around a magical building in the Unaligned District. While not a relic, per se, it is a wondrous place integral to the cohesiveness and success of the Co-Op.%0a%0aDoctrine%0aThe Code of The Co-Op%0a“Now this is the Code of The Co-Op, which every member must know,%0aAnd the one who keeps it will prosper, but the one who breaks it shall go.%0aAs the Willamette flows through Portland, the code goes on without stop;%0aThe success of the Co-Op’s the members; the member’s success the Co-Op.%0aGive aid to your fellow members, for they will aid you in return%0aThrough cooperative effort and help from each other, each member can thrive and can learn.%0aThe room of the member is the member’s, and none this sanctum shall breach;%0aThe whole of the building is the Co-Op’s, however, owned and protected by each.%0aDo not inform on your neighbors, nor to mortals their secrets reveal;%0aVisitors of factions are welcome, if they don’t cause hostile zeal.%0aWithhold not your knowledge nor power, from those who share this our abode,%0aFor to do what you can to strengthen each other is the goal of the Code.”%0aMechanics%0aThe Co-Op is open to membership from full supernatural template characters only (so currently Changelings, Werewolves, Mages, and Vampires):%0a%0a• The newest members have around-the-clock access to the Co-Op’s safe house. The building is a safe haven for all members to gather and learn from one another. They gain one dot in Safe Place as a shared merit split between all of the Co-Op’s members.%0a•• As members become more integrated into life at the Co-Op, they often move into one of the numerous magically-accessed apartments. These apartments are not exactly in the building, per se, but they can only be entered and exited through the building, and customize their co-located position according to the needs and desires of their occupants. Members at this level gain one dot in a location-based merit appropriate to their faction, such as sanctum, haven, hollow, or den.%0a••• Once members have begun to live together, they have more opportunity to benefit from the knowledge and contacts of their fellow members. Oftentimes their fellow members aid them in making new contacts and friends around the city (either in the mortal world or the supernatural one) or in finding jobs where they can put their particular talents to good use. They gain 2 dots in any combination, split between Contacts, Allies, and Resources.%0a•••• As members become further embroiled in their supernatural lives, and also gain ties to the community around the Co-Op, it becomes necessary for them to work to help each other better balance their mortal and supernatural lives. They gain 3 dots in merits appropriate to helping maintain that balance or divide in their lives: Alternate Identity, Shadow Name, Many Mask, Touchstone, Blood and Bone Affinity (Bone only), and Anchored. The chosen merits must be ones available to the member’s faction.%0a••••• As a member reaches the highest level of integration within the Co-Op, the differences between his own supernatural abilities and those of his fellow Co-Op members become less meaningful and divisive. The member gains 3 dots of item merits from factions that are not his own: Enhanced Item, Imbued Item, Fetish, Token, Hedgespun, Artifact, or similar merits at ST discretion. Furthermore, a member at this level is now able to use his own power stat (gnosis, blood potency, wyrd, primal urge) and power source (mana, blood, glamour, essence) to activate supernatural devices. Any stat for which there is no equivalent for (e.g., a mage using a Fetish that references his Honor rating) is treated as a 1.%0a%0aContact%0aDrake Roberts%0a[&#8593; back to top]%0a%0a!!Heralds of the Void%0a(Open Membership)%0a%0a“You’re special, you know. So few are brought to the central chamber. So few get to touch the Black Stone. So few are truly worthy of The Void’s wisdom. At least, receiving it so directly. But they’ve been watching you. They told me you’re ready. Ready to see just what you’ve been working towards. The transcendence you’re so close to achieving.%0aJust this way. Through the hall, and into the door on the left. It’s locked, but it will open for you. Nobody else should be in there. It will be on the altar. You’ll know it. A simple touch, and you’ll hear it. Trust me when I say it will change you forever.%0aMe? No, I’m not coming with you. It’s something you have to do alone. But don’t fret. You wouldn’t be doing this if They didn’t already know you were ready for it….”%0a%0aThe Heralds of the Void are a Cult built around the Renatus Dynasty’s message of spiritual transformation and occult knowledge. With the right information, you can transcend. With the right knowledge, you’ll be capable of anything. With the right support, you can make full use of what Power you have. Of course, few know of their true benefactors behind the scene.%0a%0aUnlike the Renatus Kindred themselves, however, they usually only hear The Void in one of two ways: speaking with a member of the Dynasty (who lead the Cult, of course), or being allowed to Commune with it through the Black Stone, a relic of sorts at the center of the Cult that allows a temporary connection with The Void directly. A dangerous thing for a living mind.%0a%0aPurpose%0aThe Renatus Dynasty (a Mekhet lineage) leads the Heralds of The Void, who can be made up of other Kindred, mortals, and other supernatural individuals, towards a sort of preternatural enlightenment focused on sharpening one’s supernatural abilities in order to strengthen the soul and one’s overall potency.%0a%0aDoctrine%0aThe general goals of the Dynasty and Cult involve a sort of warped version of the Ordo Dracul’s creed, a transcendence past one’s limitations through whatever knowledge can be put to that use. Supernatural power is encouraged, through whatever means, so long as you don’t harm your own growth or that of the rest of the Cult/Dynasty.%0a%0aOverall, the Cult’s members are expected to have access to each other for assistance in developing their abilities, whatever they may be, and will often be temporarily grouped together by those in higher positions for the sake of matching those that need assistance with those most likely to be capable of providing that sort of help. Those of lower initiation are expected to follow groupings decided upon by those higher up (often members of the Dynasty itself).%0a%0aIn addition to these ‘internal’ methods of improvement, members are all expected to use whatever contacts and means they have to learn of Occult relics, artifacts, tomes, and other potential sources of knowledge or supernatural potency, provide that information to the Heralds’ leaders and to each other, and then ultimately to retrieve them in the case of physical items. The exact methods of coming into such things varies between members, but little care is generally given for the legality involved.%0a%0aFinally, all cultists are expected to keep the secrets of other members from the outside world, unless explicit permission is given to provide such information. This isn’t just supernatural secrets, like psychic capabilities or faction affiliation, it includes personal weaknesses, criminal history, and whatever else might come up.%0a%0aTies to the setting%0aThe Renatus are said to be inherently distrustful to the point of near-hatred with regards to Invictus Vampires, due to a past rivalry with a failed dynasty aligned with that covenant. They’ve since left, but the Kindred within the Heralds, and sometimes the more knowledgeable members of other factions, still tend to distrust the Invictus.%0a%0aMechanics%0aAvailability: Kindred involved in the cult (ideally most), most ghouls, and all mortals/supernaturals will use the Mystery Cult Initiation merit, with mechanics as shown below:%0a%0a• Initiates are clued in to some hidden aspect of the world, or are made to further the experience they already have. They gain an Occult specialty of their choice.%0a%0a•• Those Adepts that have taken their first significant steps towards transcending their limitations learn to apply what they’ve learned to all aspects of themselves. They gain Interdisciplinary Specialty for their Occult specialty (or another Occult specialty they already have)%0a%0a••• Those Seekers that have become notable in the cult, and have begun to be trusted with recruitment and task-setting, learn to detect the gifts of others, so they might find those who would benefit from the group’s message, learn from their capabilities, and/or inform others within. They gain Unseen Sense (Mortal Sleepwalkers) (To clarify: It triggers for those with supernatural merits and lesser templates, not all supernaturals)%0a%0a•••• Those ghouled and more powerful mortal leaders, the Speakers, that have begun to learn of the Dynasty, directing the less informed in their name and organizing its day to day affairs, learn to draw others in and make it clear just what the Void can offer, or how it can improve you. They gain the Inspiring merit.%0a%0a••••• The Enlightened. Only Kindred may have this level of initiation, though that’s not always known by those seeking it out. While all Dynasty members have a sense for The Void, only those that truly work towards its ends garner any real attention. This represents that attention. In addition to whatever information it might provide on its own (Narrator discretion), once per chapter (week) it will provide directly applicable information about any character, visible location, the current situation, or otherwise that can be asked in a yes/no fashion by the PLAYER (the character doesn’t need to be seeking it specifically, the player decides what the void is going to show them). This requires no roll or expenditure.%0a%0aNOTE: This is not to say a mortal can’t reach this peak. It just means that they won’t be mortal for long.%0aContact%0aFalco1029%0a[&#8593; back to top]%0a%0a!!The House of Roses%0a(Changeling and Fae-Touched Only)%0a%0aPurpose%0aRose House followers will normally go out of their way, even to risking themselves, to protect the innocent and serve the greater good, regardless on how they define innocent and good.%0a%0aRelic%0aThe Blue Rose Crown. True Blue Roses don’t exist in the real world, only in the Hedge. Because of this Blue Roses in literature are symbols of love, prosperity, immortality and unattainable ideals. This hedgespun circlet of Blue Roses never fades or wilts.%0a%0aDoctrine%0aThe member of the House of Roses believe that Hope is the greatest and most powerful emotion, and that it is only through promoting and encouraging it in themselves and others can the Others and their servants ever finally be overcome. They do this by protecting and serving others so that they can understand that no cause is ever truly lost as long as you believe, and that the right will always eventually prevail. Only together can we survive and grow.%0a%0aMechanics%0a• All Rose House members first learn that things don’t change overnight. As long as you never give up, you will succeed. They gain the Patient merit.%0a%0a•• As they advance, the House of the Rose teaches the mysteries of the Rose. They gain Goblin Vow (Roses).%0a%0a••• Rose House followers learn to focus their hope and belief against supernatural powers that would sway them from their goals and duties. They gain the Indomitable merit.%0a%0a•••• Lords and Ladies of the House of Roses learn to impart some of their hopes and aspirations into physical things so that they can be carried on if they pass. They gain the 3dot Master Shaper merit.%0a%0a••••• An embodiment of the ideals of the House of Roses, they gains 3 dots of Court Goodwill that they may divide any way they like among the Courts (other than their own). At the beginning of each Story, the Rose may redivide these dots as they choose.%0a%0aContact%0aTLotts%0a%0a%0a!!Portland Fight Club%0a(Members must have Brawl 1)%0a%0a“Pain is temporary. Quitting lasts forever.” - Lance Armstrong The Portland Fight Club is a fusion of eastern martial arts and traditional American values; diligence, competitiveness, individualism, and the ‘can-do’ spirit are upheld as the highest ideals, expressed through training in different sorts of martial arts. Rigorous exercise regimens culminate in bare-knuckled brawls, often leaving participants with bruises and scrapes as they return to their homes and families. Leaders foster a spirit of camaraderie in the Club and disputes are solved through duels — if you got a problem with someone, take it to the ring or keep it to yourself. Ecstatic motivational speeches serve as the Club’s sermons, instilling pride, loyalty, and feeling of unstoppable drive in those that listen.%0a%0aMechanics%0a• Recruit The first thing expected of initiates is to learn the basics of fighting. They gain a Brawl Specialty of their choice.%0a%0a•• Member Once the basics are down, they are honed over and over again until they’re perfected. Gain the Area of Expertise merit assigned to the specialization afforded by the first dot of Cult Initiation.%0a%0a••• Fighter Although newer members are expected to participate in fights as well, it is not until this rank they are allowed to participate in any major brawls or tournaments. As such, they receive more intense training and gain a dot of Brawl.%0a%0a••••Veteran At this rank, members are accustomed to both pain and fatigue and are no longer affected much by either. Gain three dots in the Iron Stamina merit.%0a%0a•••••Master Only those who display true physical mastery in the ring rise to the highest ranks within the Club. These are the men and women responsible for training members of lower rank. Gain three dots of fighting style merits distributed as the player see fit (that is, one one-dot fighting style plus one two-dot fighting style, three one-dot fighting styles, or one three-dot fighting style). These must all use the Brawl skill. Additionally, characters at this level have unrivaled experience when it comes to understanding the nuances of different martial arts; when purchasing a Fighting Style in the future, gain two dots instead of one.%0a%0aContact%0aLugh%0a[&#8593; back to top]%0a%0a!!The Rose City Guild%0a(Mortal/+ Only)%0a%0aPurpose%0aWhen the Embassy was founded the Guild forced their way into a seat at the table- much to the consternation of the other factions. This was accomplished through the Guild’s goal of Identification- they brought with them an entire binder full of names, pseudonyms, and photos of almost every single member of the newly formed Embassy. Knowledge, not petty supernatural tricks, was the power that carried the day for them.%0a%0aSince the war, the guild has only grown and been split into chapters formed around various professions with the over goal of protecting mortals and the covert goal of continuing Identify and preferably gain leverage over other supernaturals. Each chapter actively recruits mortals, psychics, and other minor talents that don’t fall under the other factions’ aegis.%0a%0aDoctrine%0aDetect. Identify. Protect.%0a%0aThis is the Rose City Guild’s mission. Though the organization has its roots in the founding of Portland, the modern incarnation of the Guild came about during the War of the Four when professionals and businessmen came together with strategies to keep their communities safe from the supernatural menace. Through the 70s the Guild became more open to ‘Parapsychology’- psychic powers - and successfully recruited some of these people to help them protect humanity. When the war finally ended in 1980 The Rose City Guild was well established, well financed, and dedicated to keeping the city safe from the supernatural monsters of the city. They had also proven that the greatest powers one can have is organization, motivation, and knowledge.%0a%0aMechanics%0aThough the RCG is a Mystery Cult, it does not count against the MCI cap or 5 dots, and all mortals may receive 1 free dot of Rose City Guild Initiation at Character Creation.%0a%0a• Members of the Guild know one another and gossip flows freely, they gain Contacts (RCG) (•)%0a%0a•• It’s a dangerous world and established members of the Guild have safe houses to retreat to when necessary.

For levels 4 & 5 members must be a veteran of the War of Four)%0a%0a“You cannot qualify war in harsher terms than I will. War is cruelty, and you cannot refine it; and those who brought war into our country deserve all the curses and maledictions a people can pour out. I know I had no hand in making this war, and I know I will make more sacrifices to-day than any of you to secure peace. […] But these comparisons are idle. I want peace, and believe it can only be reached through union and war, and I will ever conduct war with a view to perfect an early success.” - William Sherman%0a%0aDuring the War of Four Factions, sin burned liked flame, condemning many a good person to ash and to dust. The Society of the Cinders caters to those diamonds the rough, survivors and sycophants that lasted through the flame. Officially, the Society of Cinders is a social club dedicated to advocating for the rights of Veterans of Four Factions and offering support to all Veterans. They gained a reputation from stopping a series of executions that were thinly veiled attempts to settle old grudges.%0a%0aNot all veterans, even among those who receive services, are actual members. However, the cult claims to represent all veterans regardless of their actual membership. The cult wraps itself in the narrative of the war and wears its scar like a fine suit. The Society of the Cinders takes it upon itself to deal with the lingering monstrosities from the war. They also simultaneously serve as a living, gruesome reminder for what transpired there, a reminder for why this peace is necessary, and as a gatekeeper against the worst stories.%0a%0aPurpose%0aNever forget the war and what happened there, so that it might never happen again. Never forget those who sacrificed so that it ended. Never forget that there are monsters out there who would weave the sins of the past into an atrocity for the future.%0a%0aRelic%0aA simple urn that contains ashes from those lost in the war. The urn contains the ashes from all five factions, and despite its small size is said to contain the ashes from hundreds or thousands of soldiers. Those in the cult who die, even if they were not veterans of the war, have the option of being cremated and having their ashes placed in the urn, along with a memorial that tells of their exploits.%0a%0aDoctrine%0aThe cult is a meritocracy ruled by consensus. It’s a network of social ties built on respect and shared trauma, bundled together and given direction by a few people. War stories and veteran rights are the only doctrine, though secretly the cult takes a keen ear to who should be sharing what story.%0a%0aMechanics%0a• You can tell yourself that you haven’t joined a cult—you’re just a Drinking Buddy who likes to hear stories. You’ve started to frequent places where Veterans from the War of Four Factions tend to visit, and they know you. You gain Contacts • (War of Four Veterans) representing the stories they are willing to tell you about the past and the present. All you have to do is listen and appreciate.%0a%0a•• Advocates are told the troubles that Veterans from the War of Four Factions have and are expected to respond favorably. Veterans know who has their back, and in turn they have yours.

Gain the Air of Menace or Empath merit, depending on whether you carry those scars with you or help others face them.%0a%0a•••• Correspondents graduate from responding to the needs of Veterans to anticipating when politics will turn against them and proactively mobilizing other members of the cult. Each faction gets their information from a different source. Changelings and Mages peer into dreams, gaining Dream •••. Mortals and Werewolves rely on their interpersonal connections and quid-pro-quo, gaining three dots of Contacts. Vampires read the secret signs scattered around the city and the political climate from afar, gaining Cacophony Savvy •••.%0a%0a••••• Some cults become Legends in their own time, iconic names whose stories are uttered in the same breath as the war itself. These are either people who lived and fought during the war, or have made such great strides for veterans that their name is synonymous with protecting them. They learn to cultivate a mystique of desperation and insanity, while toeing the line between “crazy” and “too crazy,” and few will harm another veteran while in their presence. All members at this level receive Fame • related to their past service or their current efforts as well as Jack-Booted Thug. Jack-Booted Thug applies applies to all Veterans of the War of Four Factions and all members of the Society of the Cinders instead of Carthians.

In its upper echelons though, there is a Vision of Sissy, an elevation of that creative prowess to the level of the divine. To be god-touched and gods themselves. Modern Muses, spreading the fire of Inspiration through the world, and the words of the gods both wicked and divine %0a%0aPurpose%0a%0aThe Muses seek to elevate their arts and talents to exceptional and even supernatural levels, pursuing them with a passion bordering on and perhaps well past what could be called madness. Through their prowess they seek to inspire the people around them with their messages, and become mediums between the human world and the realms of gods %0a%0aDoctrine%0a%0aRecruit the artists of the city with supernatural gifts to bring out their talent to the level of true divinity. All magical artists can be Muses. Do not be exclusive. Take under your wings to inspire those without such magical gifts, and perhaps awaken gifts within them %0a%0aPassion is the seed of talent is the seed of Inspiration is truth is beauty is passion. Pursue your passions and talents with every possible ferver. Sacrifice everything for your art. Nothing is a step too far in the pursuit of artistic genius and perfection. Starvation, drugs, depravity, complete madness. If it brought your talent out and brought you closer to the divine than every bit was worth it. This is true whether seeking inspiration yourself, or guiding someone else to it.%0a%0aNo art is unworthy. Whether your craft is song, poetry, painting, sculpture, street art, sex work, photography or anything else, all art is the medium through the words of gods and no art should be discounted by any member. Cultivate all artists, and seek the truth, meaning, and inspiration in any talent you find. There is truth and enlightenment everywhere%0a%0aMagic is art. Blending of art into magic, and magic into art is key to unlocking the highest potentials. Seek to find the places where they are one and the same, that is where the gods live. Likewise seek to find how your magic can heighten your art. Likewise, bring out the magic in the artists you take under your wing. This is not just acceptable it is encouraged%0a%0aTies to the setting%0a%0aThe Pantheon of Muses has ties to Portland's expansive creative people. Street performers, painters, poets, strippers, prostitutes, even graphic designers might know about the Muses as a loose community and fellowship of artists where one might find tips and tricks to develop their talents and bounce ideas for their next piece off of. Or perhaps just find their next hookup or decent drugs, their meetups might seem a little culty but they're always a good time with lots of energy and people up for whatever. %0a%0aAmong the supernatural community however, they are often drawn from and too those that Admire creative powers, influencing humanity, magical experimentation, and faith in strange gods. Vampiric Acolytes of the Crone, Silver Ladder and Free Council mages, many of the assorted fae with artistic gifts are prized members and proteges, and cahalith werewolves may find some truth in their pursuits. Many of the Gifted mortals may find a place in their community as well%0a%0aTitles and Mechanics%0a%0a• "Talents" far and wide are welcome to the Muses, almost nobody is turned away and the cult in it's lower levels is very easy to join. Usually those with peripheral membership are those with artistic talents being mentored and guided by the more experienced muses.

In its upper echelons though, there is a Vision of Sissy, an elevation of that creative prowess to the level of the divine. To be god-touched and gods themselves. Modern Muses, spreading the fire of Inspiration through the world, and the words of the gods both wicked and divine %0a%3c %0a%3c Purpose%0a%3c %0a%3c The Muses seek to elevate their arts and talents to exceptional and even supernatural levels, pursuing them with a passion bordering on and perhaps well past what could be called madness. Through their prowess they seek to inspire the people around them with their messages, and become mediums between the human world and the realms of gods %0a%3c %0a%3c Doctrine%0a%3c %0a%3c Recruit the artists of the city with supernatural gifts to bring out their talent to the level of true divinity. All magical artists can be Muses. Do not be exclusive. Take under your wings to inspire those without such magical gifts, and perhaps awaken gifts within them %0a%3c %0a%3c Passion is the seed of talent is the seed of Inspiration is truth is beauty is passion. Pursue your passions and talents with every possible ferver. Sacrifice everything for your art. Nothing is a step too far in the pursuit of artistic genius and perfection. Starvation, drugs, depravity, complete madness. If it brought your talent out and brought you closer to the divine than every bit was worth it. This is true whether seeking inspiration yourself, or guiding someone else to it.%0a%3c %0a%3c No art is unworthy. Whether your craft is song, poetry, painting, sculpture, street art, sex work, photography or anything else, all art is the medium through the words of gods and no art should be discounted by any member. Cultivate all artists, and seek the truth, meaning, and inspiration in any talent you find. There is truth and enlightenment everywhere%0a%3c %0a%3c Magic is art. Blending of art into magic, and magic into art is key to unlocking the highest potentials. Seek to find the places where they are one and the same, that is where the gods live. Likewise seek to find how your magic can heighten your art. Likewise, bring out the magic in the artists you take under your wing. This is not just acceptable it is encouraged%0a%3c %0a%3c Ties to the setting%0a%3c %0a%3c The Pantheon of Muses has ties to Portland's expansive creative people. Street performers, painters, poets, strippers, prostitutes, even graphic designers might know about the Muses as a loose community and fellowship of artists where one might find tips and tricks to develop their talents and bounce ideas for their next piece off of. Or perhaps just find their next hookup or decent drugs, their meetups might seem a little culty but they're always a good time with lots of energy and people up for whatever. %0a%3c %0a%3c Among the supernatural community however, they are often drawn from and too those that Admire creative powers, influencing humanity, magical experimentation, and faith in strange gods. Vampiric Acolytes of the Crone, Silver Ladder and Free Council mages, many of the assorted fae with artistic gifts are prized members and proteges, and cahalith werewolves may find some truth in their pursuits. Many of the Gifted mortals may find a place in their community as well%0a%3c %0a%3c Titles and Mechanics%0a%3c %0a%3c • "Talents" far and wide are welcome to the Muses, almost nobody is turned away and the cult in it's lower levels is very easy to join. Usually those with peripheral membership are those with artistic talents being mentored and guided by the more experienced muses. They have access to the rest of the membership to develop and advertise their arts, and gain a bonus specialization in either Crafts or Expression from their association %0a%3c %0a%3c •• "Patrons" find themselves just higher up, and learn not only to develop their art to its best but to immerse themselves in the artists around them. They find and learn about the other members talents, and gain a higher understanding of art as a whole. They gain the Taste merit (WoD 2e)%0a%3c %0a%3c ••• "Inspired" begin to hear the whispers of the divine within their artistic and impassioned reveries, and the true magical nature of the cult is revealed. While in the depths of their inspration, visions and whispers reveal truths to them from beyond. They gain the Dream merit at 2 dots (MtA 2e)%0a%3c %0a%3c •••• "Muses" not only hear the words of the divine, but begin to inspire sending out whispers of their own. The Muses have heightened their craft to ecstatic levels, and can infuse their art with true godly inspiration. They gain the merit "Song in their Heart" (WtF 2e)%0a%3c %0a%3c ••••• "Gods" those at the highest pinnacle of passion, talent, inspriration, and truth can use their art for truly incredible feats. The entire world is just one vast story told and sung and painted by far away gods, and new gods of this level of power may alter this story in a limited fashion, weaving into the narrative a degree of plot armor from the slings and arrows life has to offer us as they perform in the stage of life.%0a%3c %0a%3c Because of this, fortune seems to favor the Gods at every turn, little things just always seem to work out for them. They never hit traffic, they don't accidentally stub their toes, they seem to just effortlessly dance through life at every turn. When the greater slings and arrows come their way, their luck rarely fails them too, always managing a way to write themselves out of the worst threats. Twice per chapter, they can reflexively benefit from one of the following conditions. Charmed, Steadfast, Resolute, and Prepared.%0a

Quitting lasts forever.” - Lance Armstrong The Portland Fight Club is a fusion of eastern martial arts and traditional American values; diligence, competitiveness, individualism, and the ‘can-do’ spirit are upheld as the highest ideals, expressed through training in different sorts of martial arts. Rigorous exercise regimens culminate in bare-knuckled brawls, often leaving participants with bruises and scrapes as they return to their homes and families. Leaders foster a spirit of camaraderie in the Club and disputes are solved through duels — if you got a problem with someone, take it to the ring or keep it to yourself. Ecstatic motivational speeches serve as the Club’s sermons, instilling pride, loyalty, and feeling of unstoppable drive in those that listen.%0a%3c %0a%3c Mechanics%0a%3c • Recruit The first thing expected of initiates is to learn the basics of fighting.

However, once they went on the offensive in the War of the Four, the other factions learned to give the cult some respect, for their warriors were fanatical, six-armed zealots adept in striking hard and fast, leaving blood and terror behind them, both from the brutal killing style they followed, as well as the bodies that would go missing. Post-War, rather than return to being insular, the cult as remained active in vampire politics, their Hand of Preservation even going so far as to add service to the Ambassador to his list of responsibilities, while their Hand of Creation maintains her hold on Elysium.%0a> %0a> The Kalikula is organized down the three active energies of Brahman, Creation, Destruction, and Preservation. Each branch is responsible for various aspects of the Cult, and they work together as a whole very well. Broadly, the Preservation branch is responsible for defending the cult and its interests, the Destruction branch is responsible for destroying that which would threaten the cult and its interests, and the Creation branch is responsible for the creation and expanding of both the cult and its interests. Within that, is a tangled mess of responsibilities, where any task could really be given to any branch of the cult.%0a> %0a144,152c142,148%0a%3c When the Embassy was founded the Guild forced their way into a seat at the table- much to the consternation of the other factions.

As the Hippie Movement was spreading all across the country, psychics and pagan practitioners (both with and without legitimate powers) came together in Portland out of a desire for that similar sense of tribal community. Thought it was formed not long after the Rose City Guild, the Sisters existed outside the Guild. Many of them were not even aware of the Guild’s existence, not at first.%0a> %0a> The Sisters developed their Doctrine over the course of the decade as the membership grew into their powers and the national dialogue around women shifted after the publication of Friedan’s The Feminine Mystique. They became devoted to the success of their members, whatever form that success meant, and to the elimination of those who stood in the way of that success. In the public eye, the Sisters were outspoken activists at feminist protests and rallies, while in private they worked to hex the status quo. In the mid 1970s, however, the cult’s attention was diverted from the glass ceiling as the War of the Four spilled into the mortal lives of Portland.%0a> %0a> Six years ago, the cult ostensibly vanished when High Priestess Siobhan Walsh was found dead in her Crestwood home, which also served as the headquarters of the Fundament. The remaining sisters scattered to the winds, seeming to vanish off the grid overnight. Siobhan’s daughter, Juniper, has returned to Portland and begun to discover her mother’s secrets, including the Book of Shadows, the cult’s secret ritual space beneath the house, and the truth about what she thought was simply her mother’s coven. Though the cult has laid broken these past years, Juniper’s discoveries have led her to believe that it is time for a renaissance of the Fundament— especially as Portland’s nights grow more fraught with danger.%0a> %0a> Purpose%0a> By exploring the intersection of feminine power and spirituality, the Sisters of the Fundament provide a foundation of support while pushing the boundaries of the Self, achieving their Goals, and banishing Obstacles that stand in their way.%0a> %0a> Relic%0a> There is a Book of Shadows that has passed from one High Priestess to the next, containing in it the rites of the Fundament going back to its founding.%0a> %0a> Doctrine%0a> The Sisters are, first and foremost, devoted to each other’s success. Each Sister declares different Goals that they aspire to achieve and the Cult works with them to help make those Goals manifest. The Goals that each Sister declares can cover a wide variety of spheres, mundane or supernatural, physical or emotional. There are no wrong answers. One Sister’s Goal may be to bring more wealth into her life, another’s may be to expand her psychic abilities, while another may be to try and heal a psychological trauma that haunts her from the past. The Cult teaches that each Sister brings with her unique strengths and weaknesses, which should be celebrated. All of these, then, weave together to form the Fundament. As they believe that united they are stronger, the Sisterhood channels the Collective Power of the Fundament to help each Sister achieve her aspirations. When an Obstacle stands in the way of a Sister’s goal, or worse, a Sister is in danger, she can always count on the Fundament banding together to banish this threat to her success.%0a> %0a> Progression in the Sisterhood%0a> • Page of Cups. The Page of Cups, like the Pages in all the suits, represents some sort of beginning or renewal. The Page of Cups indicates the surprising and unexpected nature of inspiration that comes to us from the realm of the unconscious and the spirit. Inspiration is seen to be something which comes upon us most unexpectedly and often in a manner which we do not understand.%0a> %0a> •• Ace of Wands. In the Ace of Wands, a hand reaches out from a cloud, as if a spiritual opportunity or offering is being made, to grasp a wand that is still flowering, growing and developing. The leaves floating down with the wind signify material and spiritual progress and balance. In the distance on the left, there is a castle that represents the promise of what opportunities may come.%0a> %0a> ••• Knight of Pentacles. The Knight of Pentacles, like the Knights of the other suits, represents work, effort, and the responsibility that follows upon the dreams of the Page. The Knight of Pentacles sits upon a heavy plough horse in the midst of a field. In his hands he carries a single gold coin. His eyes reflect careful thought and consideration. The Knight is engaged in the often toilsome, routine efforts required to realise the dreams of his heart. He is building the foundations to support his dreams and his goals.%0a> %0a> •••• Queen of Swords. The Queen of Swords sits high on her throne with a stern look on her face indicating that no-one can fool her. In her right hand, she comfortably holds a sword pointed to the sky, and her left hand extends as if she has something to offer to others. Behind her is a spring sky, different from the winter settings on most other Swords cards, and this has an emergence and growth quality to it. The sky is clear, representing her clarity of mind as she considers matters of the intellect. The bird above her head symbolises the mind’s ability to soar above day-to-day issues in order to arrive at appropriate solutions.%0a> %0a> ••••• High Priestess. The High Priestess is also known as Persephone, Isis, the Corn Maiden and Artemis. She sits at the gate before the great Mystery, as indicated by the Tree of Life in the background. She sits between the darkness and the light, represented by the pillars of Solomon’s temple, which suggests it is she who is the mediator of the passage into the depth of reality. The tapestry hung between the pillars keeps the casual onlookers out and allows only those initiated to enter. The pomegranates on the tapestry are sacred to Persephone. They are a symbol of duty (because Persephone ate a pomegranate seed in the underworld which forced her to return every year). The blue robe the Priestess is wearing is a symbol of knowledge. She is wearing the crown of Isis symbolising the Triple Goddess. The solar cross on her breast is a symbol of balance between male and female.%0a> %0a> Mechanics%0a> • Page of Cups.

The building, also referred to as The Co-Op, is a stone affair, and is kept well protected by the members of the Co-Op. The group’s members are all members of the supernatural community dedicated to working together towards their individual goals as well as towards the common good of the Co-Op. Members are expected not just to tolerate or be kind to one another, but to cooperate with and help each other. The general belief of the Co-Op’s members is that there is strength to be found in unity and diversity. It is not uncommon for members to help each other with projects, research, or job searches.%0a%3c %0a%3c The building itself aids the Co-Op in it’s mission. The Co-Op benefits from its members living in a single building, thus reinforcing the close bonds formed between the members. Given the diverse needs of its membership, the Co-Op succeeds in large part due to the efforts of the mage and changeling who first struck a bargain in the creation of the building. The changeling and the Mastigos worked together to tie the building’s apartment doors to both the hedge and remote locations of the fallen world. While the actual details of the building’s creation are complex, the results are less so, although no less wondrous. The door to each member’s apartment, when opened with their key, leads to a living area best suited to their needs. For changelings this could be a hollow in the hedge, for a mage it could be a remote basement study with a small hallow, vampire’s rooms are almost universally havens away from any threat of sunlight, while some werewolves find forested dens guarding loci. Each ‘apartment’ is bounded by space magic, so that the only way in or out of the area is through the apartment door (although rarely the Hedge manages to shift a trod into the living area, such trods are almost always simply walking paths that loop back to the same living area). While not exactly common, it is neither rare for a minor spirit or an experiment-gone-awry to escape someone’s apartment and pass through the halls of the Co-Op. Usually the intruder is stopped my supernatural defenses, or else by other members. Such disruptions are minor, but keep things interesting in the day-to-day. Fortunately, the building also prevents pure mortals from noticing or remembering the odd goings-on in the main areas.%0a%3c %0a%3c As members become more well-known and earn renown among their peers for their helpfulness to the other members, they often become a bit more entrenched in supernatural affairs, and it becomes necessary to either separate their mortal and supernatural identities, or else to strengthen their bond to their humanity so as to maintain the balance needed to live such a life with their morals and sanity intact. Eventually the most notable members manage to collect trinkets and items of power from their fellow Co-Op members, and even learn to activate those items with their own internal powers as they internalize some of the diversity of their group.%0a%3c %0a%3c Purpose%0a%3c The Co-op is a group dedicated to aiding one another to mutual benefit. Living proof that the whole can be more than the sum of it’s parts, the Co-Op is made of members determined to use their unique talents, insights, and abilities, to aid those who have pledged themselves to do the same. In doing so, members not only excel in their own endeavors, but learn more about the other factions as well.%0a%3c %0a%3c Relic%0a%3c Much of the Co-Op focuses around a magical building in the Unaligned District. While not a relic, per se, it is a wondrous place integral to the cohesiveness and success of the Co-Op.%0a%3c %0a%3c Doctrine%0a%3c The Code of The Co-Op%0a%3c “Now this is the Code of The Co-Op, which every member must know,%0a%3c And the one who keeps it will prosper, but the one who breaks it shall go.%0a%3c As the Willamette flows through Portland, the code goes on without stop;%0a%3c The success of the Co-Op’s the members; the member’s success the Co-Op.%0a%3c Give aid to your fellow members, for they will aid you in return%0a%3c Through cooperative effort and help from each other, each member can thrive and can learn.%0a%3c The room of the member is the member’s, and none this sanctum shall breach;%0a%3c The whole of the building is the Co-Op’s, however, owned and protected by each.%0a%3c Do not inform on your neighbors, nor to mortals their secrets reveal;%0a%3c Visitors of factions are welcome, if they don’t cause hostile zeal.%0a%3c Withhold not your knowledge nor power, from those who share this our abode,%0a%3c For to do what you can to strengthen each other is the goal of the Code.”%0a%3c Mechanics%0a%3c The Co-Op is open to membership from full supernatural template characters only (so currently Changelings, Werewolves, Mages, and Vampires):%0a%3c %0a%3c • The newest members have around-the-clock access to the Co-Op’s safe house. The building is a safe haven for all members to gather and learn from one another. They gain one dot in Safe Place as a shared merit split between all of the Co-Op’s members.%0a%3c •• As members become more integrated into life at the Co-Op, they often move into one of the numerous magically-accessed apartments. These apartments are not exactly in the building, per se, but they can only be entered and exited through the building, and customize their co-located position according to the needs and desires of their occupants. Members at this level gain one dot in a location-based merit appropriate to their faction, such as sanctum, haven, hollow, or den.%0a%3c ••• Once members have begun to live together, they have more opportunity to benefit from the knowledge and contacts of their fellow members. Oftentimes their fellow members aid them in making new contacts and friends around the city (either in the mortal world or the supernatural one) or in finding jobs where they can put their particular talents to good use. They gain 2 dots in any combination, split between Contacts, Allies, and Resources.%0a%3c •••• As members become further embroiled in their supernatural lives, and also gain ties to the community around the Co-Op, it becomes necessary for them to work to help each other better balance their mortal and supernatural lives. They gain 3 dots in merits appropriate to helping maintain that balance or divide in their lives: Alternate Identity, Shadow Name, Many Mask, Touchstone, Blood and Bone Affinity (Bone only), and Anchored. The chosen merits must be ones available to the member’s faction.%0a%3c ••••• As a member reaches the highest level of integration within the Co-Op, the differences between his own supernatural abilities and those of his fellow Co-Op members become less meaningful and divisive. The member gains 3 dots of item merits from factions that are not his own: Enhanced Item, Imbued Item, Fetish, Token, Hedgespun, Artifact, or similar merits at ST discretion. Furthermore, a member at this level is now able to use his own power stat (gnosis, blood potency, wyrd, primal urge) and power source (mana, blood, glamour, essence) to activate supernatural devices. Any stat for which there is no equivalent for (e.g., a mage using a Fetish that references his Honor rating) is treated as a 1.%0a%3c %0a%3c Contact%0a%3c Drake Roberts%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Heralds of the Void%0a%3c (Open Membership)%0a%3c %0a%3c “You’re special, you know. So few are brought to the central chamber. So few get to touch the Black Stone. So few are truly worthy of The Void’s wisdom. At least, receiving it so directly. But they’ve been watching you. They told me you’re ready. Ready to see just what you’ve been working towards. The transcendence you’re so close to achieving.%0a%3c Just this way. Through the hall, and into the door on the left. It’s locked, but it will open for you. Nobody else should be in there. It will be on the altar. You’ll know it. A simple touch, and you’ll hear it. Trust me when I say it will change you forever.%0a%3c Me? No, I’m not coming with you. It’s something you have to do alone. But don’t fret. You wouldn’t be doing this if They didn’t already know you were ready for it….”%0a%3c %0a%3c The Heralds of the Void are a Cult built around the Renatus Dynasty’s message of spiritual transformation and occult knowledge. With the right information, you can transcend. With the right knowledge, you’ll be capable of anything. With the right support, you can make full use of what Power you have. Of course, few know of their true benefactors behind the scene.%0a%3c %0a%3c Unlike the Renatus Kindred themselves, however, they usually only hear The Void in one of two ways: speaking with a member of the Dynasty (who lead the Cult, of course), or being allowed to Commune with it through the Black Stone, a relic of sorts at the center of the Cult that allows a temporary connection with The Void directly. A dangerous thing for a living mind.%0a%3c %0a%3c Purpose%0a%3c The Renatus Dynasty (a Mekhet lineage) leads the Heralds of The Void, who can be made up of other Kindred, mortals, and other supernatural individuals, towards a sort of preternatural enlightenment focused on sharpening one’s supernatural abilities in order to strengthen the soul and one’s overall potency.%0a%3c %0a%3c Doctrine%0a%3c The general goals of the Dynasty and Cult involve a sort of warped version of the Ordo Dracul’s creed, a transcendence past one’s limitations through whatever knowledge can be put to that use. Supernatural power is encouraged, through whatever means, so long as you don’t harm your own growth or that of the rest of the Cult/Dynasty.%0a%3c %0a%3c Overall, the Cult’s members are expected to have access to each other for assistance in developing their abilities, whatever they may be, and will often be temporarily grouped together by those in higher positions for the sake of matching those that need assistance with those most likely to be capable of providing that sort of help. Those of lower initiation are expected to follow groupings decided upon by those higher up (often members of the Dynasty itself).%0a%3c %0a%3c In addition to these ‘internal’ methods of improvement, members are all expected to use whatever contacts and means they have to learn of Occult relics, artifacts, tomes, and other potential sources of knowledge or supernatural potency, provide that information to the Heralds’ leaders and to each other, and then ultimately to retrieve them in the case of physical items. The exact methods of coming into such things varies between members, but little care is generally given for the legality involved.%0a%3c %0a%3c Finally, all cultists are expected to keep the secrets of other members from the outside world, unless explicit permission is given to provide such information. This isn’t just supernatural secrets, like psychic capabilities or faction affiliation, it includes personal weaknesses, criminal history, and whatever else might come up.%0a%3c %0a%3c Ties to the setting%0a%3c The Renatus are said to be inherently distrustful to the point of near-hatred with regards to Invictus Vampires, due to a past rivalry with a failed dynasty aligned with that covenant. They’ve since left, but the Kindred within the Heralds, and sometimes the more knowledgeable members of other factions, still tend to distrust the Invictus.%0a%3c %0a%3c Mechanics%0a%3c Availability: Kindred involved in the cult (ideally most), most ghouls, and all mortals/supernaturals will use the Mystery Cult Initiation merit, with mechanics as shown below:%0a%3c %0a%3c • Initiates are clued in to some hidden aspect of the world, or are made to further the experience they already have. They gain an Occult specialty of their choice.%0a%3c %0a%3c •• Those Adepts that have taken their first significant steps towards transcending their limitations learn to apply what they’ve learned to all aspects of themselves. They gain Interdisciplinary Specialty for their Occult specialty (or another Occult specialty they already have)%0a%3c %0a%3c ••• Those Seekers that have become notable in the cult, and have begun to be trusted with recruitment and task-setting, learn to detect the gifts of others, so they might find those who would benefit from the group’s message, learn from their capabilities, and/or inform others within. They gain Unseen Sense (Mortal Sleepwalkers) (To clarify: It triggers for those with supernatural merits and lesser templates, not all supernaturals)%0a%3c %0a%3c •••• Those ghouled and more powerful mortal leaders, the Speakers, that have begun to learn of the Dynasty, directing the less informed in their name and organizing its day to day affairs, learn to draw others in and make it clear just what the Void can offer, or how it can improve you. They gain the Inspiring merit.%0a%3c %0a%3c ••••• The Enlightened. Only Kindred may have this level of initiation, though that’s not always known by those seeking it out. While all Dynasty members have a sense for The Void, only those that truly work towards its ends garner any real attention. This represents that attention. In addition to whatever information it might provide on its own (Narrator discretion), once per chapter (week) it will provide directly applicable information about any character, visible location, the current situation, or otherwise that can be asked in a yes/no fashion by the PLAYER (the character doesn’t need to be seeking it specifically, the player decides what the void is going to show them). This requires no roll or expenditure.%0a%3c %0a%3c NOTE: This is not to say a mortal can’t reach this peak. It just means that they won’t be mortal for long.%0a%3c Contact%0a%3c Falco1029%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c The House of Roses%0a%3c (Changeling and Fae-Touched Only)%0a%3c %0a%3c Purpose%0a%3c Rose House followers will normally go out of their way, even to risking themselves, to protect the innocent and serve the greater good, regardless on how they define innocent and good.%0a%3c %0a%3c Relic%0a%3c The Blue Rose Crown. True Blue Roses don’t exist in the real world, only in the Hedge. Because of this Blue Roses in literature are symbols of love, prosperity, immortality and unattainable ideals. This hedgespun circlet of Blue Roses never fades or wilts.%0a%3c %0a%3c Doctrine%0a%3c The member of the House of Roses believe that Hope is the greatest and most powerful emotion, and that it is only through promoting and encouraging it in themselves and others can the Others and their servants ever finally be overcome. They do this by protecting and serving others so that they can understand that no cause is ever truly lost as long as you believe, and that the right will always eventually prevail. Only together can we survive and grow.%0a%3c %0a%3c Mechanics%0a%3c • All Rose House members first learn that things don’t change overnight. As long as you never give up, you will succeed. They gain the Patient merit.%0a%3c %0a%3c •• As they advance, the House of the Rose teaches the mysteries of the Rose. They gain Goblin Vow (Roses).%0a%3c %0a%3c ••• Rose House followers learn to focus their hope and belief against supernatural powers that would sway them from their goals and duties. They gain the Indomitable merit.%0a%3c %0a%3c •••• Lords and Ladies of the House of Roses learn to impart some of their hopes and aspirations into physical things so that they can be carried on if they pass. They gain the 3dot Master Shaper merit.%0a%3c %0a%3c ••••• An embodiment of the ideals of the House of Roses, they gains 3 dots of Court Goodwill that they may divide any way they like among the Courts (other than their own). At the beginning of each Story, the Rose may redivide these dots as they choose.%0a%3c %0a%3c Contact%0a%3c TLotts%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c The Kalikula%0a%3c (Open Membership)%0a%3c %0a%3c The Kalikula is a family as much as it is a cult. The name itself means “The Family of Kali”, and they treat themselves as such. To the uninitiated, they’re surprisingly open to worship of any of the forms of Devi, though the official worship is focused around Kali herself.%0a%3c %0a%3c History%0a%3c That the Kalikula migrated to Portland from India is widely know. Brought over by Chandra and Indira, they remained relatively low-key until the war started to create massive casualties for most Kindred groups. However, once they went on the offensive in the War of the Four, the other factions learned to give the cult some respect, for their warriors were fanatical, six-armed zealots adept in striking hard and fast, leaving blood and terror behind them, both from the brutal killing style they followed, as well as the bodies that would go missing. Post-War, rather than return to being insular, the cult as remained active in vampire politics, their Hand of Preservation even going so far as to add service to the Ambassador to his list of responsibilities, while their Hand of Creation maintains her hold on Elysium.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Kalikula is organized down the three active energies of Brahman, Creation, Destruction, and Preservation. Each branch is responsible for various aspects of the Cult, and they work together as a whole very well. Broadly, the Preservation branch is responsible for defending the cult and its interests, the Destruction branch is responsible for destroying that which would threaten the cult and its interests, and the Creation branch is responsible for the creation and expanding of both the cult and its interests. Within that, is a tangled mess of responsibilities, where any task could really be given to any branch of the cult.%0a%3c %0a%3c Purpose%0a%3c To follow and worship Devi in her form as Kali, as well as bring glory to her by sacrificing her enemies’ blood.%0a%3c %0a%3c Doctine%0a%3c The Kalikula have no hard doctrine. Rather, fanatical worship of Devi, however one personally chooses, is the primary method. Though all dedicants are encouraged to align with one of the three Active Energies of Brahman that represent Kali: Creation, Destruction, or Preservation. This Path is chosen at the time of Initiation, and cannot be changed.%0a%3c %0a%3c Status is a loose concept in the cult. With everyone being roughly equal to each other, the only real positions within the cult are those at the top. The Three Hands, and their Speaker. Currently, Chandra is both Speaker and the Hand of Creation, with Indira holding the Hand of Destruction.%0a%3c %0a%3c Mechanics%0a%3c • Initiate At this level, you’ve freshly joined the cult. As an Initiate, you’re allowed to enter the compound for worship, and encouraged to choose a path to follow. You gain a specialty based on your Path: Those that follow Creation gain a specialty in Crafts of their choice, those that follow Destruction gain a specialty in either Brawl or Melee based on their chosen method of war, those that follow Preservation gain one dot in Trained Observer.%0a%3c %0a%3c •• Dedicant At this level, you’re formally welcomed into the Compound, and given a place to stay. You attend all the worship sessions for those as a whole, as well as those for your chosen path. Gain Safe Place (Kalikula Compound) •.%0a%3c %0a%3c ••• Adherent At this level, you’ve reached the pinnacle of the mundane side of the worship of Kalikula. At this point, a dedicant chooses their Ishta-Devi, or personal representation of Devi. Kali is always the suggested, but not required by the cult. One’s worship of Kali, and Devi through her, is personal after all. Anyone who is not a Circle of the Crone gains the Chorister merit. Those who have already formally joined the Circle of the Crone instead gain a dot of Occult.%0a%3c %0a%3c •••• Achaka At this level, you’ve been inducted into the rituals of the priesthood of Kali, and are responsible for helping to guide the mundane worship of your path. Characters at this level who do not already have Altar (Kalikula Compound) receive it. Those characters that already have the Altar merit, who follow the Path of Preservation, gain 3 dots in Temple Guardian. Those who follow the Path of Creation, gain 3 dots in the Primal Creation Cruac Style, while those who follow the Path of Destruction gain 3 dots in the Opening of the Void Cruac Style.%0a%3c %0a%3c ••••• Purohita At this level, you’re expected to guide the worship of the Cult as a whole. As one of the Chief Priests, you’re also expected to help with the cult’s Cruac. As a Kindred, to lead it, otherwise, you’re expected to participate every time without fail. However, this is not without its own blessings. When using the teamwork rules for Cruac rituals, so long as your character is leading the ritual, you do not double the time necessary to make the roll, nor do you double the time between rolls if participating members have no dots in Cruac. However, rather than using the highest Cruac rating of the group, the ritual uses your Cruac rating, as you lead the cult in the ritual. They just do what they’re told without question.%0a%3c %0a%3c Contact%0a%3c None (This is an NPC run Cult)%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Portland Fight Club%0a%3c (Members must have Brawl 1)%0a%3c %0a%3c “Pain is temporary. Quitting lasts forever.” - Lance Armstrong The Portland Fight Club is a fusion of eastern martial arts and traditional American values; diligence, competitiveness, individualism, and the ‘can-do’ spirit are upheld as the highest ideals, expressed through training in different sorts of martial arts. Rigorous exercise regimens culminate in bare-knuckled brawls, often leaving participants with bruises and scrapes as they return to their homes and families. Leaders foster a spirit of camaraderie in the Club and disputes are solved through duels — if you got a problem with someone, take it to the ring or keep it to yourself. Ecstatic motivational speeches serve as the Club’s sermons, instilling pride, loyalty, and feeling of unstoppable drive in those that listen.%0a%3c %0a%3c Mechanics%0a%3c • Recruit The first thing expected of initiates is to learn the basics of fighting. They gain a Brawl Specialty of their choice.%0a%3c %0a%3c •• Member Once the basics are down, they are honed over and over again until they’re perfected. Gain the Area of Expertise merit assigned to the specialization afforded by the first dot of Cult Initiation.%0a%3c %0a%3c ••• Fighter Although newer members are expected to participate in fights as well, it is not until this rank they are allowed to participate in any major brawls or tournaments. As such, they receive more intense training and gain a dot of Brawl.%0a%3c %0a%3c ••••Veteran At this rank, members are accustomed to both pain and fatigue and are no longer affected much by either. Gain three dots in the Iron Stamina merit.%0a%3c %0a%3c •••••Master Only those who display true physical mastery in the ring rise to the highest ranks within the Club. These are the men and women responsible for training members of lower rank. Gain three dots of fighting style merits distributed as the player see fit (that is, one one-dot fighting style plus one two-dot fighting style, three one-dot fighting styles, or one three-dot fighting style). These must all use the Brawl skill. Additionally, characters at this level have unrivaled experience when it comes to understanding the nuances of different martial arts; when purchasing a Fighting Style in the future, gain two dots instead of one.%0a%3c %0a%3c Contact%0a%3c Lugh%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c The Rose City Guild%0a%3c (Mortal/+ Only)%0a%3c %0a%3c Purpose%0a%3c When the Embassy was founded the Guild forced their way into a seat at the table- much to the consternation of the other factions. This was accomplished through the Guild’s goal of Identification- they brought with them an entire binder full of names, pseudonyms, and photos of almost every single member of the newly formed Embassy. Knowledge, not petty supernatural tricks, was the power that carried the day for them.%0a%3c %0a%3c Since the war, the guild has only grown and been split into chapters formed around various professions with the over goal of protecting mortals and the covert goal of continuing Identify and preferably gain leverage over other supernaturals. Each chapter actively recruits mortals, psychics, and other minor talents that don’t fall under the other factions’ aegis.%0a%3c %0a%3c Doctrine%0a%3c Detect. Identify. Protect.%0a%3c %0a%3c This is the Rose City Guild’s mission. Though the organization has its roots in the founding of Portland, the modern incarnation of the Guild came about during the War of the Four when professionals and businessmen came together with strategies to keep their communities safe from the supernatural menace. Through the 70s the Guild became more open to ‘Parapsychology’- psychic powers - and successfully recruited some of these people to help them protect humanity. When the war finally ended in 1980 The Rose City Guild was well established, well financed, and dedicated to keeping the city safe from the supernatural monsters of the city. They had also proven that the greatest powers one can have is organization, motivation, and knowledge.%0a%3c %0a%3c Mechanics%0a%3c Though the RCG is a Mystery Cult, it does not count against the MCI cap or 5 dots, and all mortals may receive 1 free dot of Rose City Guild Initiation at Character Creation.%0a%3c %0a%3c • Members of the Guild know one another and gossip flows freely, they gain Contacts (RCG) (•)%0a%3c %0a%3c •• It’s a dangerous world and established members of the Guild have safe houses to retreat to when necessary.

For levels 4 & 5 members must be a veteran of the War of Four)%0a%3c %0a%3c “You cannot qualify war in harsher terms than I will. War is cruelty, and you cannot refine it; and those who brought war into our country deserve all the curses and maledictions a people can pour out. I know I had no hand in making this war, and I know I will make more sacrifices to-day than any of you to secure peace. […] But these comparisons are idle. I want peace, and believe it can only be reached through union and war, and I will ever conduct war with a view to perfect an early success.” - William Sherman%0a%3c %0a%3c During the War of Four Factions, sin burned liked flame, condemning many a good person to ash and to dust. The Society of the Cinders caters to those diamonds the rough, survivors and sycophants that lasted through the flame. Officially, the Society of Cinders is a social club dedicated to advocating for the rights of Veterans of Four Factions and offering support to all Veterans. They gained a reputation from stopping a series of executions that were thinly veiled attempts to settle old grudges.%0a%3c %0a%3c Not all veterans, even among those who receive services, are actual members. However, the cult claims to represent all veterans regardless of their actual membership. The cult wraps itself in the narrative of the war and wears its scar like a fine suit. The Society of the Cinders takes it upon itself to deal with the lingering monstrosities from the war. They also simultaneously serve as a living, gruesome reminder for what transpired there, a reminder for why this peace is necessary, and as a gatekeeper against the worst stories.%0a%3c %0a%3c Purpose%0a%3c Never forget the war and what happened there, so that it might never happen again. Never forget those who sacrificed so that it ended. Never forget that there are monsters out there who would weave the sins of the past into an atrocity for the future.%0a%3c %0a%3c Relic%0a%3c A simple urn that contains ashes from those lost in the war. The urn contains the ashes from all five factions, and despite its small size is said to contain the ashes from hundreds or thousands of soldiers. Those in the cult who die, even if they were not veterans of the war, have the option of being cremated and having their ashes placed in the urn, along with a memorial that tells of their exploits.%0a%3c %0a%3c Doctrine%0a%3c The cult is a meritocracy ruled by consensus. It’s a network of social ties built on respect and shared trauma, bundled together and given direction by a few people. War stories and veteran rights are the only doctrine, though secretly the cult takes a keen ear to who should be sharing what story.%0a%3c %0a%3c Mechanics%0a%3c • You can tell yourself that you haven’t joined a cult—you’re just a Drinking Buddy who likes to hear stories. You’ve started to frequent places where Veterans from the War of Four Factions tend to visit, and they know you. You gain Contacts • (War of Four Veterans) representing the stories they are willing to tell you about the past and the present. All you have to do is listen and appreciate.%0a%3c %0a%3c •• Advocates are told the troubles that Veterans from the War of Four Factions have and are expected to respond favorably. Veterans know who has their back, and in turn they have yours. You gain Allies • (War of Four Veterans).%0a%3c %0a%3c ••• Those who delve into the secrets and atrocities of the past and wear those scars proudly are call Heroes, often in mockery of the villainy they performed. Gain the Air of Menace or Empath merit, depending on whether you carry those scars with you or help others face them.%0a%3c %0a%3c •••• Correspondents graduate from responding to the needs of Veterans to anticipating when politics will turn against them and proactively mobilizing other members of the cult. Each faction gets their information from a different source. Changelings and Mages peer into dreams, gaining Dream •••. Mortals and Werewolves rely on their interpersonal connections and quid-pro-quo, gaining three dots of Contacts. Vampires read the secret signs scattered around the city and the political climate from afar, gaining Cacophony Savvy •••.%0a%3c %0a%3c ••••• Some cults become Legends in their own time, iconic names whose stories are uttered in the same breath as the war itself. These are either people who lived and fought during the war, or have made such great strides for veterans that their name is synonymous with protecting them. They learn to cultivate a mystique of desperation and insanity, while toeing the line between “crazy” and “too crazy,” and few will harm another veteran while in their presence. All members at this level receive Fame • related to their past service or their current efforts as well as Jack-Booted Thug. Jack-Booted Thug applies applies to all Veterans of the War of Four Factions and all members of the Society of the Cinders instead of Carthians.

Knowing the right people is only the first step in joining, as only those with any real sway within the city advances beyond the lowest ranks of membership. They know the right people, leveraging personal influence to benefit other members of the Council, bartering favours during secretive meetings that are not entirely unlike a Freemasonry Lodge; esoteric symbolism and obscure rituals give legitimacy to the cult, reinforcing the internal hierarchy by adding layers of authority to each new rung of the ladder.%0a%3c %0a%3c Doctrine%0a%3c Members are not expected to follow superiors blindly, but there is an informal understanding that the Council operates under a quid pro quo system. Outsiders might have claimed the organization promotes corruption within the city, but its members know that by empowering themselves, they empower Portland.%0a%3c %0a%3c Relic%0a%3c A golden calf serves as their symbol, representing a great many things at once after all, they are Portland.%0a%3c %0a%3c Mechanics%0a%3c Availability: Status (Arts and Society) 1+%0a%3c %0a%3c • Initiate Even an initiate of the Council at the lowest rank is recognized as part of the crème de la crème of Portland.

Members are now considered part of the inner circle, the real members of the organization. Gain a dot of allies in a respectable mortal sphere (Education, Law, Politics, etc).%0a%3c %0a%3c ••• Chosen Seasoned members that rise in rank are invited to secretive meetings to discuss the future of Portland. Political bargains are stuck behind closed doors and favours are peddled for advance notice of boardroom decisions. This backroom dealing gives some experience in brokering deals, and as such members gain a dot of Persuasion.%0a%3c %0a%3c •••• Master At this level, cultists enter the ranks of leadership of the Council, and suddenly find a greater amount of the cult’s resources at their disposal. Gain a total of 3 dots divided between Contacts, Allies, and Retainers.%0a%3c %0a%3c ••••• Grand Master The rare few that navigates themselves to the very pinnacle of the Sovereign Cult will never lack in material wealth again. Not only do they have access to a treasury brimming with steep membership fees, but lower ranked members often offer gifts in hopes of advancing quicker through the ranks. This material wealth confers 3 dots of resources; additionally, a Grand Master may make a Resources ••••• purchase once per month by drawing on the cult’s coffers.%0a%3c %0a%3c Contact%0a%3c Cinn, randomim%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c The Temple of Inner Illumination%0a%3c (Open.)%0a%3c %0a%3c Purpose%0a%3c The Temple of Inner Illumination is a spiritual (but non-religious) cult that promotes inner peace and enlightenment through meditation, martial training, and service to the community. Based loosely on traditional tropes of Shao-lin and other eastern sects, the Temple is, quietly, a Silver Ladder Cryptopoly, with the goal of guiding promising students to Awakening through the practices of the temple.%0a%3c %0a%3c Cultists - Serious Martial Arts students, Wuxia fans, Scared Citizens Wanting to learn self defense, Anxious office workers needing meditation.%0a%3c %0a%3c Mechanics%0a%3c • 1 dot of Meditative Mind Merit (may be combined with purchased dots of same merit). The initiate is taught how to calm and focus their mind and how to achieve inner peace.%0a%3c %0a%3c •• 1 dot of Defensive Combat (Choose Brawl or Weaponry) Merit. The student learns how to defend himself against attackers without causing harm.%0a%3c %0a%3c ••• 1 dot in Expression Ability - At this level, the student becomes a teacher. They also learn how better to express their inner light to others through art or other media.%0a%3c %0a%3c •••• 3 dots in Biokinesis Merit. The teacher now becomes a master, able to channel his inner light to augment his physical abilities in ways beyond the mundane.%0a%3c %0a%3c ••••• 3 dots in Inspiring Merit. In addition, if the Presence + Expression roll results in an Exceptional Success, all Inspired targets also gains one WP point immediately. (This is in addition to the WP point gained when the Inspired condition is resolved) The grand-master of the temple is a truly inspirational figure, able to rouse others to great efforts or acts of belief with the revelation of his own inner light.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Temple is located in the Woodlawn neighborhood (there is a Buddhist temple there).%0a%3c %0a%3c Contact%0a%3c magus666%0a%3c The Sisters of the Fundament%0a%3c (Mortal+ Only)%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c “There shall ye assemble, ye who are fain to learn all sorcery, yet have not yet won its deepest secrets: to these will I teach things that are yet unknown. Keep pure your highest ideal; strive ever toward it; let naught stop you or turn you aside.” %0a%3c - Charge of the Goddess, Doreen Valiente%0a%3c %0a%3c History%0a%3c The Sisters of the Fundament were founded in the advent of the Witchcraft Revival of the 1960s, which came hand-in-hand with Second Wave Feminism in a messy, glorious explosion of the exploration of femininity and spiritual tribalism. As the Hippie Movement was spreading all across the country, psychics and pagan practitioners (both with and without legitimate powers) came together in Portland out of a desire for that similar sense of tribal community. Thought it was formed not long after the Rose City Guild, the Sisters existed outside the Guild. Many of them were not even aware of the Guild’s existence, not at first.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Sisters developed their Doctrine over the course of the decade as the membership grew into their powers and the national dialogue around women shifted after the publication of Friedan’s The Feminine Mystique. They became devoted to the success of their members, whatever form that success meant, and to the elimination of those who stood in the way of that success. In the public eye, the Sisters were outspoken activists at feminist protests and rallies, while in private they worked to hex the status quo. In the mid 1970s, however, the cult’s attention was diverted from the glass ceiling as the War of the Four spilled into the mortal lives of Portland.%0a%3c %0a%3c Six years ago, the cult ostensibly vanished when High Priestess Siobhan Walsh was found dead in her Crestwood home, which also served as the headquarters of the Fundament. The remaining sisters scattered to the winds, seeming to vanish off the grid overnight. Siobhan’s daughter, Juniper, has returned to Portland and begun to discover her mother’s secrets, including the Book of Shadows, the cult’s secret ritual space beneath the house, and the truth about what she thought was simply her mother’s coven. Though the cult has laid broken these past years, Juniper’s discoveries have led her to believe that it is time for a renaissance of the Fundament— especially as Portland’s nights grow more fraught with danger.%0a%3c %0a%3c Purpose%0a%3c By exploring the intersection of feminine power and spirituality, the Sisters of the Fundament provide a foundation of support while pushing the boundaries of the Self, achieving their Goals, and banishing Obstacles that stand in their way.%0a%3c %0a%3c Relic%0a%3c There is a Book of Shadows that has passed from one High Priestess to the next, containing in it the rites of the Fundament going back to its founding.%0a%3c %0a%3c Doctrine%0a%3c The Sisters are, first and foremost, devoted to each other’s success. Each Sister declares different Goals that they aspire to achieve and the Cult works with them to help make those Goals manifest. The Goals that each Sister declares can cover a wide variety of spheres, mundane or supernatural, physical or emotional. There are no wrong answers. One Sister’s Goal may be to bring more wealth into her life, another’s may be to expand her psychic abilities, while another may be to try and heal a psychological trauma that haunts her from the past. The Cult teaches that each Sister brings with her unique strengths and weaknesses, which should be celebrated. All of these, then, weave together to form the Fundament. As they believe that united they are stronger, the Sisterhood channels the Collective Power of the Fundament to help each Sister achieve her aspirations. When an Obstacle stands in the way of a Sister’s goal, or worse, a Sister is in danger, she can always count on the Fundament banding together to banish this threat to her success.%0a%3c %0a%3c Progression in the Sisterhood%0a%3c • Page of Cups. The Page of Cups, like the Pages in all the suits, represents some sort of beginning or renewal. The Page of Cups indicates the surprising and unexpected nature of inspiration that comes to us from the realm of the unconscious and the spirit. Inspiration is seen to be something which comes upon us most unexpectedly and often in a manner which we do not understand.%0a%3c %0a%3c •• Ace of Wands. In the Ace of Wands, a hand reaches out from a cloud, as if a spiritual opportunity or offering is being made, to grasp a wand that is still flowering, growing and developing. The leaves floating down with the wind signify material and spiritual progress and balance. In the distance on the left, there is a castle that represents the promise of what opportunities may come.%0a%3c %0a%3c ••• Knight of Pentacles. The Knight of Pentacles, like the Knights of the other suits, represents work, effort, and the responsibility that follows upon the dreams of the Page. The Knight of Pentacles sits upon a heavy plough horse in the midst of a field. In his hands he carries a single gold coin. His eyes reflect careful thought and consideration. The Knight is engaged in the often toilsome, routine efforts required to realise the dreams of his heart. He is building the foundations to support his dreams and his goals.%0a%3c %0a%3c •••• Queen of Swords. The Queen of Swords sits high on her throne with a stern look on her face indicating that no-one can fool her. In her right hand, she comfortably holds a sword pointed to the sky, and her left hand extends as if she has something to offer to others. Behind her is a spring sky, different from the winter settings on most other Swords cards, and this has an emergence and growth quality to it. The sky is clear, representing her clarity of mind as she considers matters of the intellect. The bird above her head symbolises the mind’s ability to soar above day-to-day issues in order to arrive at appropriate solutions.%0a%3c %0a%3c ••••• High Priestess. The High Priestess is also known as Persephone, Isis, the Corn Maiden and Artemis. She sits at the gate before the great Mystery, as indicated by the Tree of Life in the background. She sits between the darkness and the light, represented by the pillars of Solomon’s temple, which suggests it is she who is the mediator of the passage into the depth of reality. The tapestry hung between the pillars keeps the casual onlookers out and allows only those initiated to enter. The pomegranates on the tapestry are sacred to Persephone. They are a symbol of duty (because Persephone ate a pomegranate seed in the underworld which forced her to return every year). The blue robe the Priestess is wearing is a symbol of knowledge. She is wearing the crown of Isis symbolising the Triple Goddess. The solar cross on her breast is a symbol of balance between male and female.%0a%3c %0a%3c Mechanics%0a%3c • Page of Cups. Though you are not yet part of the Fundament, you have taken an interest in improving your life and understand that it is better to walk this path with others. At this point, you probably do not realize the extent of the Fundament’s supernatural abilities. You are welcome to come to the Sisterhood’s events and have a sponsor at ••• or higher that meets with you to help visualize your goals. Gain Allies (Sisters of the Fundament) •%0a%3c %0a%3c •• Ace of Wands. At this level, you have become an official Sister. You have joined the Fundament, and in doing so have declared at least one Goal that you want to make manifest in your life. Your Sisters will help you achieve that goal. Additionally, as you experiment, expand yourself, try new things, and sometimes fail, your Sisters are there to support you and give you advice. Gain Support Network •%0a%3c %0a%3c ••• Knight of Pentacles. At this level, you have achieved at least one of the Goals that you declared when you joined the Fundament and you are expected to lend the wisdom of your experiences to aid your Sisters. The support of your Sisters, and the rituals of the Fundament, have galvanized you against those who would stand in the path of your Success. Gain Supernatural Resistance ••%0a%3c %0a%3c •••• Queen of Swords. At this level, not only have you achieved some of your own Goals, you have helped your Sisters achieve theirs. You are a touchstone amongst the Fundament, serving as a point of leadership with responsibility over a number of Pages, Aces, and Knights. They are in your care and you are invested in seeing their Goals made manifest. As such, you have been trained in one of the Fundament’s techniques for removing Obstacles from a Sister’s path. Gain Curse Effigy or Telekinesis •••%0a%3c %0a%3c ••••• High Priestess. At this level, you are a beacon of support to your Sisters, blazing brightly from the fulfillment of your Goals. Your journey is not over, but you are interwoven with the Fundament and deeply familiar with each Sister’s Goals and the Obstacles she might encounter. Gain access to the Fundament (see below)%0a%3c %0a%3c Fundament: When you and your sisters gather together, you can each contribute your power to accomplish each other’s Goals. As a member of the Cult takes an Action, you can act as a point of leadership and call upon other members to support her. Sisters that are present in the scene may reflexively spend Willpower to add +3 to the roll. Characters that spend Willpower and also possess this level of MCI add +4 instead of +3. Note that this does not increase the amount of Willpower a character can spend per turn, but does allow multiple characters to spend Willpower on a roll.%0a%3c %0a%3c MCI Contact:Juniper Walsh%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
