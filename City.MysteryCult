Members must render aid to non-combatants of any ilk that request it, and it is suggested when they travel together, to at least aid the senior-most member in such healings.  They are not, however, beholden to anyone that knowingly means themselves or others in the immediate area harm.  By virtue of their work, it is also suggested that they work within their local communities, to practice their arts, and to aid those who may not simply need physical healing.  They can be denoted in full as the following:%0a#Treat the sick and heal the injured.%0a#Offer your services to any in need, so long as they mean no harm.%0a#A healer is nothing, without their community, walk amongst them, know them.%0a#A healer is never done learning.

Those who have attained the title are able to treat the most grievous wounds with relative ease, combining the teachings of the college to work veritable miracles on their patients.\\%0a-Once a Chapter: The first time treating an aggravated wound, the leaders of the College are able to treat the wound as if it were only lethal damage, for any eligible roll, or to count against any specific drawbacks.  This includes Lay on Hands requiring the normal amount of successes, and taking only lethal damage, instead of aggravated wounds, and the ability for mundane rolls to treat them as lethal for number of successes/time needed for the Doctor to heal them.

There’s always some unfinished business, some incomplete task, some person, place or thing they want to protect. Something that they feel was supposed to be done already. This isn’t a coincidence. In most cases, they were fated to do that. To finish what they started, to remain with their family, to keep an eye on something they took responsibility for. But it was taken away from them, the thread snipped, cord cut, and weave disrupted by violence or negligence or selfishness. And cutting a thread like that, well, it tends to draw undesired attention...%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Purpose''%0a%0aOne of the most common causes of a ghost, and thus the shortening of Fate’s threads, is a death caused by violence or selfish negligence. When you kill someone when trying to take their money, work someone to death, or otherwise let your own selfishness or greed lead to someone else’s end, it ruptures their Destiny and a ghost is left behind as the frayed ends of their fortune scatter improperly. %0a%0aThe Forgotten Threads, then, are about fixing those frayed edges, but more importantly, they’re about preventing them from happening in the first place. They seek out those that take part in criminal activities or selfish gains that are likely to lead to such an end, and warn them against it, or strongarm them into stopping. Because if you cause too much damage to the weave of destiny, far worse creatures than a handful of cultists will take notice, and by then it’s too late for you.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Relic''%0a%0aThe cult’s temple, an abandoned, haunted home in Coral Gables, acts as the ‘relic’ for the group. %0a %0a!!!%25center%25''Doctrine''%0a%0aThe Doctrine is fairly simple; progress the group’s purpose, and avoid the type of behavior the cult by its nature works against. Seek out those likely to cause ghosts formed of violence or negligence, and turn them away from that path. Seek out ghosts already formed of that, and help those entities that need to be directed to them find people that need to be “corrected” (or help do so yourself). Avoid murder, especially out of selfish motives. Avoid leading others to death in other ways for your own selfish ends. Avoid negligence leading towards the decay of others.%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Mechanics'':%0a%0a%25center%25Membership levels:%0a%0a%0a• Those that join the cult must inherently have some knowledge of the dead to be of use to it.

They gain Omen Sensitivity (•••) or Destiny (•••), even if not mortal.%0a%0a••••• The threads of destiny are strengthened around those at the pinnacle of the Forgotten Threads. When being targeted by a supernatural effect that would bind the character in an oath, pledge, geas or similar ability, force the character to do something they don’t want to do, or alter their luck or destiny, they become aware of it, and once per chapter can spend a point of Willpower to enact a Clash of Wills against it (roll Supernatural Potency + MCI; this counts as an indefinite power). If the cultist wins, the power fails to affect them, and they become immune to that specific power for the rest of the day.%0a%0a %0a:%25center%25 Contact: %25newwin%25 [[https://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/Players/JosephCambersten|Joseph Cambersten]]%0a%0a%0a!!%25center%25[[https://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/Players/HermeticSisterhood|'''Hermetic Sisterhood''']]%0a%25center%25(''Who can Join'')%0aWomen only.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Purpose''%0aThe Hermetic Sisterhood is a secret society of young and gifted women that exists to help each one to achieve its greatest and most profound potential.

The Muses were the Goddesses of artistic inspiration, the wellsprings from which poetry, lyricism, music, and art flowed. They inspired perfection, demanded it. But what is perfection? The idea of the Form too hails from ancient Greece, the renowned philosopher Plato postulating a theory that claims that for every idea or object that exists, so too does the Form of that idea or object — its truest essence, the perfect and unchanging representation of it. There are perfect Forms of passion, of love, of hate, of happiness, as there are perfect Forms of beauty, of melodiousness, of dance, and of landscapes. But art in the modern day is art for its own sake; everyone is their own master, and everyone is a critic. It should then be the true artists' vocation to pursue this sublime Form in their art, to find that perfection, to unveil it for the world to gape and awe at. No matter what the subject and no matter what the genre or style is, perfection is the standard to be held to. And the Muses are there to inspire it. Art is not subjective.%0a%0aBeyond what is visible at the surface, those waters of inspiration flow from supernatural origins. Esoteric rites worship the Muses as the living embodiments of creativity, encouraging words and masterful lessons interspersed with the sorcery of Contracts and other mythical powers to ensure the loyalty, or at the very least the discretion, of the Muses' supplicants.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Purpose''%0aThe purpose of the Muses is to guide and nurture talent in the city of Miami, guiding aspiring artists to perfection. But not only do they harness the raw talent and passion of up-and-coming artists, they also invite the distinguished and cultured into their ranks, recognizing that perfect art demands a platform to be seen and spread, creating ripples on the water that furthers their influence across the state and the world itself. As such, the cult is divided into two separate branches; the Artists, those with the creative gift, the makers of works miraculous and wondrous; and the Patrons, the people who recognizes art true value and purpose and are willing to propagate the cult’s influence through the upper echelons of Miami’s social ladder.%0a%0a''“We must be the shining exemplar of art and culture in Miami; it is our duty to establish standards to which aspiring artists must hold themselves to in order to gain recognition”''%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Relic''%0aA fresco of the ancient Greek muses at the very sanctum of their temple. Those of high enough rank in the cult congregate here to ask for the well-wishes of the Muses, hoping for good fortunes, inspiration, or their hearts' desires to be fulfilled. In this temple, the Muses gather their followers for mystical rites, dismantling the inhibitions and blocks that impede passion.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Doctrine''%0aThe Muses’ foremost command is to spread the idea of art as the vessel for ideas and concepts elevated to the perfection of their form; as such, all Artists no matter rank are expected to continue to hone and develop their skills. The Patrons are expected to promote and bring attention to the cult’s creations, ensuring that the Muses’ sublimity travels far and wide.

Small groups exist in many major cities throughout the world.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Purpose''%0aFounded to promote research in what are predominantly considered fringe sciences at best, members of SCIENCE delve deeply into subjects such as Psychotronics, Cryptozoology, UFOs and the like. However, in current day, subjects that once were science fiction, like Quantum Mechanics, Virtual Reality, Artificial Intelligence, Gene Modification and Cloning feature prominently in the work done by many younger members of the Council. Combining hard science with the scientific exploration of nominally “occult” subjects like psychic phenomena are the core of the Council’s research, but it is common for members of the Council and their research to branch out into Computers, Medicine, and other related fields.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Relic''%0aIn the main Laboratory of the Council sits an ancient object. Called a Baghdad Battery by some, this device of pottery and metal is the earliest known electrical generator, still capable of producing a charge if filled with a weak acid.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Doctrine''%0aIt is the goal of man to uncover the secrets of the universe, and anything is possible through science. Many things that were once called magic are now understood by science, and many things that modern science doesn't yet understand or believe, can be achieved by the efforts of the gifted scientists of the Council. But knowledge is not enough, without application. The Council expects its members to take a hands-on approach to invention and development of new technologies.%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Mechanics''%0a:%25center%25Membership levels:%0a:%25center%25(Who it effects):%0a%0a• Research Assistant - Only those who are already versed in both traditional and exotic sciences are admitted as assistants to the Council. A new research assistant is encouraged to put that knowledge to work for a more senior scientist. The research assistant gains the Investigative Aid merit in either Science or Occult (though we don't normally use the Investigation system per the book, this merit does provide an exceptional success on 3 rather than 5 successes when doing research using the specified skill, and a success may provide some additional information.)%0a%0a•• Researcher - At this level the Researcher has begun doing his own research and publishing papers, as well as reading and reviewing the research done by others. He gains one dot in the Library merit for either Science or Occult. (This may stack with normal purchase of the merit up to the three dot limit)%0a%0a••• Lead Researcher - The Lead Researcher is expected to be able to coordinate other Researchers and Research Assistants to further her projects and put her theories to use in physical form. Furthermore, she is expected to attend monthly symposia, and present her theories and experimental results. Gain the Hobbyist Clique (Crafts) merit.%0a%0a•••• Scientific Fellow - A scientist of this caliber should have his own lab by now, and be able to build his own devices, but even the best sometimes require dedicated help. The Scientific Fellow gains 3 dots of Lab Assistants (Retainers) to be divided as he chooses (3 1 dot Retainers, 1 3 dot, etc). This Retainer may be human, but just as often is the result of the Scientific Fellow’s own research into Cloning, Artificial Intelligence, Hybridization, Robotics, Dimensional Travel, or other means.%0a%0a••••• Master Scientist - Only the most gifted scientists who have completed at least one Magnum Opus project are granted a seat on the Supreme Council and given the title of Master Scientist. Most of these choose an appropriate Nom de Science, usually Doctor or Professor “something” (even if they do not actually hold a doctorate or professorship; the “something” being related to their preferred field of research). The Magnum Opus project is always something that exceeds the boundaries of modern mundane science, be it a device, serum, or other means, and each one is different and unique. This grants the effects of one Supernatural Merit of up to 3 dots, without prerequisites (if any).%0a%0a:%25center%25Contact: Solomon Reed%0a%0a%0a%0a!!%25center%25'''[[https://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/Players/TheSentinels|The Sentinels]]'''%0a%25center%25(''Subterfuge 1+; AND Supernatural, Half-template, or Mortal+'')%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Purpose''%0aTo maintain the secrecy of the supernatural world from the mundane, and to defend the shroud with vigor and zeal. Whether preventative or post-disaster mitigation, the Sentinels keep mundane mortals in the dark about the robust layer of occult happenings that occur under their noses.

Originally founded by Uratha as an extension of securing the Oath of the Moon’s laws, Kindred adherents looking to prop up the Masquerade gravitated towards the order soon after, and then more. Their devotion generally manifests as a disposition that leans away from violence, since violence draws attention, but they are by no means pacifists.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Mechanics''%0a:%25center%25Membership levels:%0a%0a• Initiate:   Initiates become well acclimated to keeping a secret.

Choose from an Investigation or Occult skill dot OR two dots in Fast Talking.%0a%0a•••• Dedicated: The Dedicated are devoted to their cause, and hypnotically suggestive in their ability to diffuse a potentially damning, and damn dangerous, situation. They can stop a vampire mid-frenzy or put a werewolf off its Death Rage. Take the 3-dot Peacemaker merit.%0a%0a••••• Warden: Wardens are unerringly strategic in their defense of the tenuous accord that shields the mundane from the supernatural, and the supernatural from the mundane.

The cult is an amalgam of the rough, wayward, and criminal, all seeking to prove themselves in wild blood and glory. They develop members into the strongest and most violent barbarians they can be, binding them together in bloody camaraderie with social rituals and shared tribulations.

Overwhelming power and chaos are the true purpose: what they do with such abilities is their own concern.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Relic''%0aThe War Path reveres the symbolism of an ominously dark and twisted horn decorated in gold and jewels, rumored to be from another realm. It looks more like the horn of a monster than any natural animal, but that also enhances its mystery (and skepticism.) Cultists at the fourth or fifth ranks may sound the horn on special occasions, particularly to start hunts and/or ceremonial combat.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Doctrine''%0aConceptually, each cultist walks their own narrow way down an archetypal "War Path," pursuing and expanding their abilties to gain insight into other ways, thus expanding their path toward its true potential (for ultraviolence.) The cult preaches continual progress and perseverance by any means possible, preferably in a spectacular and violent manner. Might makes right in the War Path, not honor or fairness, and brutal tactics are not only okay, but encouraged. The cult does not require or enforce a particular dogma or spirituality beyond bloody drama. Strength and bravado are key on the War Path: between fights, cultists engage in performative acts of resilience and prowess, whether that's smashing bricks, leaping through fire, ritual cutting, or wilder fare.%0a%0aCult-wide judgements are determined by MCI 5 cultists, with counsel from MCI 4 cultists. The War Path has no official set of ranks otherwise, but respect MCI in terms of techniques and trials (i.e. MCI benefits and rank.)  Cultists are not permitted to kill or capture each other outside of extreme circumstances (as judged by the above), nor are they permitted to fight while under threat or pursuing a shared goal (e.g. other realms, ST/PRP scenes.) They are otherwise permitted to attack each other, and Bashing damage is only rarely considered a problem.

The start of the College is the beginning of that preservation, and the start of something new altogether.%0a%3c !!!%25center%25''Relic''%0a%3c A customized, and antiqued looking measuring tool owned by Knox’s mother before him.  The simple and elegant silvered tool has notches and grooves, etched with various measurements and notations, and is covered in stains from various different chemical compounds.%0a%3c !!!%25center%25''Doctrine''%0a%3c The College of Healers conforms to a very stringent code, not unlike the Hippocratic Oath.  Members must render aid to non-combatants of any ilk that request it, and it is suggested when they travel together, to at least aid the senior-most member in such healings.  They are not, however, beholden to anyone that knowingly means themselves or others in the immediate area harm.  By virtue of their work, it is also suggested that they work within their local communities, to practice their arts, and to aid those who may not simply need physical healing.  They can be denoted in full as the following:%0a%3c #Treat the sick and heal the injured.%0a%3c #Offer your services to any in need, so long as they mean no harm.%0a%3c #A healer is nothing, without their community, walk amongst them, know them.%0a%3c #A healer is never done learning.  Knowledge leads to breakthroughs, breakthroughs save lives.%0a%3c  %0a%3c !!!%25center%25''Mechanics''%0a%3c %25center%25Membership levels%0a%3c %0a%3c • Student- All those who are willing to learn and have a basic aptitude, are students within the college.  The singular purpose of the College helps hone the skills of those who are willing to learn, teaching them better ways to deal with those things they already specialize in.\\%0a%3c -Area of Expertise granted for a specialty already known in either Medicine or Survival that is of medical relevance.%0a%3c %0a%3c •• Apprentice- Those who do well in their studies are granted more responsibility, but also more freedom.  Members at this level are encouraged to do their own studies, to work with others and to seek out knowledge wherever they can find it.  In addition, they are granted access to the College’s library to aid in their pursuits.\\%0a%3c -Library (Medicine) 1%0a%3c %0a%3c ••• Journeyman- Members at this level of understanding tend to begin to move out on their own, bringing knowledge back to the College and even teach some of the younger members things that they have found on their travels.\\%0a%3c -Gains a +1 to Medicine or Survival%0a%3c %0a%3c •••• Artisan- Members who have reached this level begin to learn the more esoteric arts to aid those who are in need of healing.  Either through faith, or self-determination, there begins to be the edge of the supernatural around them, learning how to take on the wounds and sicknesses of others onto themselves.\\%0a%3c -Lay on Hands (3 dot supernatural merit), even if not mortal%0a%3c %0a%3c ••••• Doctor- Those who have focused so much of their life, of their will, into the College itself call themselves Doctor or Doc amongst their peers in the College.  Their knowledge is only matched by their creativity and curiosity, and it shows in the way that they treat their patients and teach their students.  Those who have attained the title are able to treat the most grievous wounds with relative ease, combining the teachings of the college to work veritable miracles on their patients.\\%0a%3c -Once a Chapter: The first time treating an aggravated wound, the leaders of the College are able to treat the wound as if it were only lethal damage, for any eligible roll, or to count against any specific drawbacks.  This includes Lay on Hands requiring the normal amount of successes, and taking only lethal damage, instead of aggravated wounds, and the ability for mundane rolls to treat them as lethal for number of successes/time needed for the Doctor to heal them.  This in no way, shape or form translates further damage to be worked on into anything less than it originally was.%0a%3c %0a%3c :%25center%25Contact: Ebram (Knox)%0a%3c  %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a

There’s always some unfinished business, some incomplete task, some person, place or thing they want to protect. Something that they feel was supposed to be done already. This isn’t a coincidence. In most cases, they were fated to do that. To finish what they started, to remain with their family, to keep an eye on something they took responsibility for. But it was taken away from them, the thread snipped, cord cut, and weave disrupted by violence or negligence or selfishness. And cutting a thread like that, well, it tends to draw undesired attention...%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25''Purpose''%0a%3c %0a%3c One of the most common causes of a ghost, and thus the shortening of Fate’s threads, is a death caused by violence or selfish negligence. When you kill someone when trying to take their money, work someone to death, or otherwise let your own selfishness or greed lead to someone else’s end, it ruptures their Destiny and a ghost is left behind as the frayed ends of their fortune scatter improperly. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Forgotten Threads, then, are about fixing those frayed edges, but more importantly, they’re about preventing them from happening in the first place. They seek out those that take part in criminal activities or selfish gains that are likely to lead to such an end, and warn them against it, or strongarm them into stopping. Because if you cause too much damage to the weave of destiny, far worse creatures than a handful of cultists will take notice, and by then it’s too late for you.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25''Relic''%0a%3c %0a%3c The cult’s temple, an abandoned, haunted home in Coral Gables, acts as the ‘relic’ for the group. %0a%3c  %0a%3c !!!%25center%25''Doctrine''%0a%3c %0a%3c The Doctrine is fairly simple; progress the group’s purpose, and avoid the type of behavior the cult by its nature works against. Seek out those likely to cause ghosts formed of violence or negligence, and turn them away from that path. Seek out ghosts already formed of that, and help those entities that need to be directed to them find people that need to be “corrected” (or help do so yourself). Avoid murder, especially out of selfish motives. Avoid leading others to death in other ways for your own selfish ends. Avoid negligence leading towards the decay of others.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25''Mechanics'':%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25Membership levels:%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c • Those that join the cult must inherently have some knowledge of the dead to be of use to it. Initiates gain the Interdisciplinary Specialty (Ghosts) (•) merit.%0a%3c %0a%3c •• Once the cultists have proven themselves to the local populace of ghosts, making it clear they’re working to help them and prevent others from falling to the same fate, they end up with more talkative spectres, even if they often must communicate indirectly. They gain Contacts (Local Ghosts) (•).%0a%3c %0a%3c ••• As the cultist establishes themselves, the dead resonate more clearly with them. They gain Look Between Worlds (••) if a Beast or Herald, Ephemeral Sight (ghosts) (••) if mortal, a 2xp or less ghost-perceiving power if one’s available to other supernaturals, or a dot of Occult otherwise.%0a%3c %0a%3c •••• Working so closely with the threads of fate and destiny allows one to gain more awareness of them, or a resonance to them. They gain Omen Sensitivity (•••) or Destiny (•••), even if not mortal.%0a%3c %0a%3c ••••• The threads of destiny are strengthened around those at the pinnacle of the Forgotten Threads. When being targeted by a supernatural effect that would bind the character in an oath, pledge, geas or similar ability, force the character to do something they don’t want to do, or alter their luck or destiny, they become aware of it, and once per chapter can spend a point of Willpower to enact a Clash of Wills against it (roll Supernatural Potency + MCI; this counts as an indefinite power). If the cultist wins, the power fails to affect them, and they become immune to that specific power for the rest of the day.%0a%3c %0a%3c  %0a%3c :%25center%25Contact: [[Joseph Cambersten]]%0a%3c %0a

A new research assistant is encouraged to put that knowledge to work for a more senior scientist. The research assistant gains the Investigative Aid merit in either Science or Occult (though we don't normally use the Investigation system per the book, this merit does provide an exceptional success on 3 rather than 5 successes when doing research using the specified skill, and a success may provide some additional information.)%0a%3c %0a%3c •• Researcher - At this level the Researcher has begun doing his own research and publishing papers, as well as reading and reviewing the research done by others.

The Scientific Fellow gains 3 dots of Lab Assistants (Retainers) to be divided as he chooses (3 1 dot Retainers, 1 3 dot, etc). This Retainer may be human, but just as often is the result of the Scientific Fellow’s own research into Cloning, Artificial Intelligence, Hybridization, Robotics, Dimensional Travel, or other means.%0a%3c %0a%3c ••••• Master Scientist - Only the most gifted scientists who have completed at least one Magnum Opus project are granted a seat on the Supreme Council and given the title of Master Scientist. Most of these choose an appropriate Nom de Science, usually Doctor or Professor “something” (even if they do not actually hold a doctorate or professorship; the “something” being related to their preferred field of research). The Magnum Opus project is always something that exceeds the boundaries of modern mundane science, be it a device, serum, or other means, and each one is different and unique.

Built on concepts of Hermetic Philosophy and Alchemy its members seek to perfect themselves and transform to a higher level of success, knowledge, power, or whatever it is they seek. The society seeks to use their combined ability to even the scales of an unforgiving and unfair world, one set against young women from achieving the success and respect the members seek.

Representing determination and power, ruled by Mars, it is through Iron the Sisters begin to truly achieve their potentials. The strength of iron, once the heat and pressure has been undertaken to cast it into shape, can take a simple hunk of ore into a sword, or a beam, or any number of tools that bring society into a new Era. %0a%3c From here members undergo a transformative process at the stone, and gain the merit "Iron Stamina" at 1 dot, able to endure endless toil in their works.%0a%3c %0a%3c ••• Copper: where Iron is hard and forceful, Copper is gentle and pliable, and a far better conductor of energies.

It is the metal of mothers, shielding us from crisis, and evocative of all that provide. Silver is born of the Moon, and it is from it that we gain wealth and prosperity to imbibe our efforts with the resources they need to become fruitful. %0a%3c Once the Sister has achieved this state of enlightenment they learn practical secrets to ensure their personal prosperity.

The Muses were the Goddesses of artistic inspiration, the wellsprings from which poetry, lyricism, music, and art flowed. They inspired perfection, demanded it. But what is perfection? The idea of the Form too hails from ancient Greece, the renowned philosopher Plato postulating a theory that claims that for every idea or object that exists, so too does the Form of that idea or object — its truest essence, the perfect and unchanging representation of it. There are perfect Forms of passion, of love, of hate, of happiness, as there are perfect Forms of beauty, of melodiousness, of dance, and of landscapes. But art in the modern day is art for its own sake; everyone is their own master, and everyone is a critic. It should then be the true artists' vocation to pursue this sublime Form in their art, to find that perfection, to unveil it for the world to gape and awe at. No matter what the subject and no matter what the genre or style is, perfection is the standard to be held to. And the Muses are there to inspire it. Art is not subjective.%0a%3c %0a%3c Beyond what is visible at the surface, those waters of inspiration flow from supernatural origins. Esoteric rites worship the Muses as the living embodiments of creativity, encouraging words and masterful lessons interspersed with the sorcery of Contracts and other mythical powers to ensure the loyalty, or at the very least the discretion, of the Muses' supplicants.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25''Purpose''%0a%3c The purpose of the Muses is to guide and nurture talent in the city of Miami, guiding aspiring artists to perfection. But not only do they harness the raw talent and passion of up-and-coming artists, they also invite the distinguished and cultured into their ranks, recognizing that perfect art demands a platform to be seen and spread, creating ripples on the water that furthers their influence across the state and the world itself. As such, the cult is divided into two separate branches; the Artists, those with the creative gift, the makers of works miraculous and wondrous; and the Patrons, the people who recognizes art true value and purpose and are willing to propagate the cult’s influence through the upper echelons of Miami’s social ladder.%0a%3c %0a%3c ''“We must be the shining exemplar of art and culture in Miami; it is our duty to establish standards to which aspiring artists must hold themselves to in order to gain recognition”''%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25''Relic''%0a%3c A fresco of the ancient Greek muses at the very sanctum of their temple. Those of high enough rank in the cult congregate here to ask for the well-wishes of the Muses, hoping for good fortunes, inspiration, or their hearts' desires to be fulfilled. In this temple, the Muses gather their followers for mystical rites, dismantling the inhibitions and blocks that impede passion.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25''Doctrine''%0a%3c The Muses’ foremost command is to spread the idea of art as the vessel for ideas and concepts elevated to the perfection of their form; as such, all Artists no matter rank are expected to continue to hone and develop their skills. The Patrons are expected to promote and bring attention to the cult’s creations, ensuring that the Muses’ sublimity travels far and wide.

The building, also referred to as The Co-Op, is a stone affair, and is kept well protected by the members of the Co-Op. The group’s members are all members of the supernatural community dedicated to working together towards their individual goals as well as towards the common good of the Co-Op. Members are expected not just to tolerate or be kind to one another, but to cooperate with and help each other. The general belief of the Co-Op’s members is that there is strength to be found in unity and diversity. It is not uncommon for members to help each other with projects, research, or job searches.%0a> %0a> The building itself aids the Co-Op in it’s mission. The Co-Op benefits from its members living in a single building, thus reinforcing the close bonds formed between the members. Given the diverse needs of its membership, the Co-Op succeeds in large part due to the efforts of the mage and changeling who first struck a bargain in the creation of the building. The changeling and the Mastigos worked together to tie the building’s apartment doors to both the hedge and remote locations of the fallen world. While the actual details of the building’s creation are complex, the results are less so, although no less wondrous. The door to each member’s apartment, when opened with their key, leads to a living area best suited to their needs. For changelings this could be a hollow in the hedge, for a mage it could be a remote basement study with a small hallow, vampire’s rooms are almost universally havens away from any threat of sunlight, while some werewolves find forested dens guarding loci. Each ‘apartment’ is bounded by space magic, so that the only way in or out of the area is through the apartment door (although rarely the Hedge manages to shift a trod into the living area, such trods are almost always simply walking paths that loop back to the same living area). While not exactly common, it is neither rare for a minor spirit or an experiment-gone-awry to escape someone’s apartment and pass through the halls of the Co-Op. Usually the intruder is stopped my supernatural defenses, or else by other members. Such disruptions are minor, but keep things interesting in the day-to-day. Fortunately, the building also prevents pure mortals from noticing or remembering the odd goings-on in the main areas.%0a> %0a> As members become more well-known and earn renown among their peers for their helpfulness to the other members, they often become a bit more entrenched in supernatural affairs, and it becomes necessary to either separate their mortal and supernatural identities, or else to strengthen their bond to their humanity so as to maintain the balance needed to live such a life with their morals and sanity intact. Eventually the most notable members manage to collect trinkets and items of power from their fellow Co-Op members, and even learn to activate those items with their own internal powers as they internalize some of the diversity of their group.%0a> %0a15,16c19,20%0a%3c Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Furthermore, a member at this level is now able to use his own power stat (gnosis, blood potency, wyrd, primal urge) and power source (mana, blood, glamour, essence) to activate supernatural devices.

Supernatural power is encouraged, through whatever means, so long as you don’t harm your own growth or that of the rest of the Cult/Dynasty.%0a> %0a> Overall, the Cult’s members are expected to have access to each other for assistance in developing their abilities, whatever they may be, and will often be temporarily grouped together by those in higher positions for the sake of matching those that need assistance with those most likely to be capable of providing that sort of help. Those of lower initiation are expected to follow groupings decided upon by those higher up (often members of the Dynasty itself).%0a> %0a> In addition to these ‘internal’ methods of improvement, members are all expected to use whatever contacts and means they have to learn of Occult relics, artifacts, tomes, and other potential sources of knowledge or supernatural potency, provide that information to the Heralds’ leaders and to each other, and then ultimately to retrieve them in the case of physical items. The exact methods of coming into such things varies between members, but little care is generally given for the legality involved.%0a> %0a> Finally, all cultists are expected to keep the secrets of other members from the outside world, unless explicit permission is given to provide such information. This isn’t just supernatural secrets, like psychic capabilities or faction affiliation, it includes personal weaknesses, criminal history, and whatever else might come up.%0a> %0a> !!!%25center%25''Ties to the setting''%0a> The Renatus are said to be inherently distrustful to the point of near-hatred with regards to Invictus Vampires, due to a past rivalry with a failed dynasty aligned with that covenant.

As the Hippie Movement was spreading all across the country, psychics and pagan practitioners (both with and without legitimate powers) came together in Portland out of a desire for that similar sense of tribal community. Thought it was formed not long after the Rose City Guild, the Sisters existed outside the Guild. Many of them were not even aware of the Guild’s existence, not at first. %0a> %0a> The Sisters developed their Doctrine over the course of the decade as the membership grew into their powers and the national dialogue around women shifted after the publication of Friedan’s The Feminine Mystique. They became devoted to the success of their members, whatever form that success meant, and to the elimination of those who stood in the way of that success. In the public eye, the Sisters were outspoken activists at feminist protests and rallies, while in private they worked to hex the status quo. In the mid 1970s, however, the cult’s attention was diverted from the glass ceiling as the War of the Four spilled into the mortal lives of Portland. %0a> %0a> Six years ago, the cult ostensibly vanished when High Priestess Siobhan Walsh was found dead in her Crestwood home, which also served as the headquarters of the Fundament. The remaining sisters scattered to the winds, seeming to vanish off the grid overnight. Siobhan’s daughter, Juniper, has returned to Portland and begun to discover her mother’s secrets, including the Book of Shadows, the cult’s secret ritual space beneath the house, and the truth about what she thought was simply her mother’s coven. Though the cult has laid broken these past years, Juniper will come to believe that it is time for a renaissance of the Fundament-- especially as Portland’s nights grow more fraught with danger.%0a> %0a> !!!%25center%25''Purpose'' %0a> %0a> By exploring the intersection of feminine power and spirituality, the Sisters of the Fundament provide a foundation of support while pushing the boundaries of the Self, achieving their Goals, and banishing Obstacles that stand in their way. %0a> %0a> !!!%25center%25''Relic'' %0a> %0a> There is a Book of Shadows that has passed from one High Priestess to the next, containing in it the rites of the Fundament going back to its founding.%0a> %0a> !!!%25center%25''Doctrine'' %0a> %0a> The Sisters are, first and foremost, devoted to each other’s success. Each Sister declares different Goals that they aspire to achieve and the Cult works with them to help make those Goals manifest. The Goals that each Sister declares can cover a wide variety of spheres, mundane or supernatural, physical or emotional. There are no wrong answers. One Sister’s Goal may be to bring more wealth into her life, another’s may be to expand her psychic abilities, while another may be to try and heal a psychological trauma that haunts her from the past. The Cult teaches that each Sister brings with her unique strengths and weaknesses, which should be celebrated. All of these, then, weave together to form the Fundament. As they believe that united they are stronger, the Sisterhood channels the Collective Power of the Fundament to help each Sister achieve her aspirations. When an Obstacle stands in the way of a Sister’s goal, or worse, a Sister is in danger, she can always count on the Fundament banding together to banish this threat to her success. %0a> %0a> !!!%25center%25''Progression in the Sisterhood'' %0a> %0a> !!!!%25center%25'''Page of Cups''' %0a> %25center%25 MCI Status • \\%0a> %25center%25''The Page of Cups, like the Pages in all the suits, represents some sort of beginning or renewal.

As the Hippie Movement was spreading all across the country, psychics and pagan practitioners (both with and without legitimate powers) came together in Portland out of a desire for that similar sense of tribal community. Thought it was formed not long after the Rose City Guild, the Sisters existed outside the Guild. Many of them were not even aware of the Guild’s existence, not at first. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Sisters developed their Doctrine over the course of the decade as the membership grew into their powers and the national dialogue around women shifted after the publication of Friedan’s The Feminine Mystique. They became devoted to the success of their members, whatever form that success meant, and to the elimination of those who stood in the way of that success. In the public eye, the Sisters were outspoken activists at feminist protests and rallies, while in private they worked to hex the status quo. In the mid 1970s, however, the cult’s attention was diverted from the glass ceiling as the War of the Four spilled into the mortal lives of Portland. %0a%3c %0a%3c Six years ago, the cult ostensibly vanished when High Priestess Siobhan Walsh was found dead in her Crestwood home, which also served as the headquarters of the Fundament. The remaining sisters scattered to the winds, seeming to vanish off the grid overnight. Siobhan’s daughter, Juniper, has returned to Portland and begun to discover her mother’s secrets, including the Book of Shadows, the cult’s secret ritual space beneath the house, and the truth about what she thought was simply her mother’s coven. Though the cult has laid broken these past years, Juniper will come to believe that it is time for a renaissance of the Fundament-- especially as Portland’s nights grow more fraught with danger.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25''Purpose'' %0a%3c %0a%3c By exploring the intersection of feminine power and spirituality, the Sisters of the Fundament provide a foundation of support while pushing the boundaries of the Self, achieving their Goals, and banishing Obstacles that stand in their way. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25''Relic'' %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a Book of Shadows that has passed from one High Priestess to the next, containing in it the rites of the Fundament going back to its founding.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25''Doctrine'' %0a%3c %0a%3c The Sisters are, first and foremost, devoted to each other’s success. Each Sister declares different Goals that they aspire to achieve and the Cult works with them to help make those Goals manifest. The Goals that each Sister declares can cover a wide variety of spheres, mundane or supernatural, physical or emotional. There are no wrong answers. One Sister’s Goal may be to bring more wealth into her life, another’s may be to expand her psychic abilities, while another may be to try and heal a psychological trauma that haunts her from the past. The Cult teaches that each Sister brings with her unique strengths and weaknesses, which should be celebrated. All of these, then, weave together to form the Fundament. As they believe that united they are stronger, the Sisterhood channels the Collective Power of the Fundament to help each Sister achieve her aspirations. When an Obstacle stands in the way of a Sister’s goal, or worse, a Sister is in danger, she can always count on the Fundament banding together to banish this threat to her success. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25''Progression in the Sisterhood'' %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25center%25'''Page of Cups''' %0a%3c %25center%25 MCI Status • \\%0a%3c %25center%25''The Page of Cups, like the Pages in all the suits, represents some sort of beginning or renewal.

The tapestry hung between the pillars keeps the casual onlookers out and allows only those initiated to enter. The pomegranates on the tapestry are sacred to Persephone. They are a symbol of duty (because Persephone ate a pomegranate seed in the underworld which forced her to return every year). The blue robe the Priestess is wearing is a symbol of knowledge.

The spirit of Cooperation that lives within, ever happy to help, builds a cohesive working group for those who are willing to truly work together. Misfits, unfortunates, psychics without a place... All are welcome, and with the destruction of Maelstrom, a new beginning is forming. The people of the Undercity were originally drawn by the promises of Maelstrom, but without his hand to lead them through his manipulation of the spirits, they are back to the basics, trying to forge their own paths forward.%0a%3c %0a%3c Living in the tunnels, trying to make ends meet, the psychics of the Undercity are a hearty group that is used to struggle. Together, they hope to forge a new place for themselves.  The Undercity, above all else, is a community that feels that it doesn't quite fit anywhere else.  While some may eventually find places among the factions, most feel displaced, and just as happy to stay among the others that they have lived with and next to, since the debacle with the Lucky 7 and their fight with the Rose City Guild began.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c '''%25color=#669999%25Purpose''' \\%0a%3c %0a%3c Not the most trusting people, considering their recent learning of the fact that they were held under the sway of captive spirits, they now are willing to follow the two who brought them back to their freedom.

In its upper echelons though, there is a Vision of Sissy, an elevation of that creative prowess to the level of the divine. To be god-touched and gods themselves. Modern Muses, spreading the fire of Inspiration through the world, and the words of the gods both wicked and divine %0a%3c %0a%3c Purpose%0a%3c %0a%3c The Muses seek to elevate their arts and talents to exceptional and even supernatural levels, pursuing them with a passion bordering on and perhaps well past what could be called madness. Through their prowess they seek to inspire the people around them with their messages, and become mediums between the human world and the realms of gods %0a%3c %0a%3c Doctrine%0a%3c %0a%3c Recruit the artists of the city with supernatural gifts to bring out their talent to the level of true divinity. All magical artists can be Muses. Do not be exclusive. Take under your wings to inspire those without such magical gifts, and perhaps awaken gifts within them %0a%3c %0a%3c Passion is the seed of talent is the seed of Inspiration is truth is beauty is passion. Pursue your passions and talents with every possible ferver. Sacrifice everything for your art. Nothing is a step too far in the pursuit of artistic genius and perfection. Starvation, drugs, depravity, complete madness. If it brought your talent out and brought you closer to the divine than every bit was worth it. This is true whether seeking inspiration yourself, or guiding someone else to it.%0a%3c %0a%3c No art is unworthy. Whether your craft is song, poetry, painting, sculpture, street art, sex work, photography or anything else, all art is the medium through the words of gods and no art should be discounted by any member. Cultivate all artists, and seek the truth, meaning, and inspiration in any talent you find. There is truth and enlightenment everywhere%0a%3c %0a%3c Magic is art. Blending of art into magic, and magic into art is key to unlocking the highest potentials. Seek to find the places where they are one and the same, that is where the gods live. Likewise seek to find how your magic can heighten your art. Likewise, bring out the magic in the artists you take under your wing. This is not just acceptable it is encouraged%0a%3c %0a%3c Ties to the setting%0a%3c %0a%3c The Pantheon of Muses has ties to Portland's expansive creative people. Street performers, painters, poets, strippers, prostitutes, even graphic designers might know about the Muses as a loose community and fellowship of artists where one might find tips and tricks to develop their talents and bounce ideas for their next piece off of. Or perhaps just find their next hookup or decent drugs, their meetups might seem a little culty but they're always a good time with lots of energy and people up for whatever. %0a%3c %0a%3c Among the supernatural community however, they are often drawn from and too those that Admire creative powers, influencing humanity, magical experimentation, and faith in strange gods. Vampiric Acolytes of the Crone, Silver Ladder and Free Council mages, many of the assorted fae with artistic gifts are prized members and proteges, and cahalith werewolves may find some truth in their pursuits. Many of the Gifted mortals may find a place in their community as well%0a%3c %0a%3c Titles and Mechanics%0a%3c %0a%3c • "Talents" far and wide are welcome to the Muses, almost nobody is turned away and the cult in it's lower levels is very easy to join. Usually those with peripheral membership are those with artistic talents being mentored and guided by the more experienced muses. They have access to the rest of the membership to develop and advertise their arts, and gain a bonus specialization in either Crafts or Expression from their association %0a%3c %0a%3c •• "Patrons" find themselves just higher up, and learn not only to develop their art to its best but to immerse themselves in the artists around them. They find and learn about the other members talents, and gain a higher understanding of art as a whole. They gain the Taste merit (WoD 2e)%0a%3c %0a%3c ••• "Inspired" begin to hear the whispers of the divine within their artistic and impassioned reveries, and the true magical nature of the cult is revealed. While in the depths of their inspration, visions and whispers reveal truths to them from beyond. They gain the Dream merit at 2 dots (MtA 2e)%0a%3c %0a%3c •••• "Muses" not only hear the words of the divine, but begin to inspire sending out whispers of their own. The Muses have heightened their craft to ecstatic levels, and can infuse their art with true godly inspiration. They gain the merit "Song in their Heart" (WtF 2e)%0a%3c %0a%3c ••••• "Gods" those at the highest pinnacle of passion, talent, inspriration, and truth can use their art for truly incredible feats. The entire world is just one vast story told and sung and painted by far away gods, and new gods of this level of power may alter this story in a limited fashion, weaving into the narrative a degree of plot armor from the slings and arrows life has to offer us as they perform in the stage of life.%0a%3c %0a%3c Because of this, fortune seems to favor the Gods at every turn, little things just always seem to work out for them. They never hit traffic, they don't accidentally stub their toes, they seem to just effortlessly dance through life at every turn. When the greater slings and arrows come their way, their luck rarely fails them too, always managing a way to write themselves out of the worst threats. Twice per chapter, they can reflexively benefit from one of the following conditions. Charmed, Steadfast, Resolute, and Prepared.%0a

Quitting lasts forever.” - Lance Armstrong The Portland Fight Club is a fusion of eastern martial arts and traditional American values; diligence, competitiveness, individualism, and the ‘can-do’ spirit are upheld as the highest ideals, expressed through training in different sorts of martial arts. Rigorous exercise regimens culminate in bare-knuckled brawls, often leaving participants with bruises and scrapes as they return to their homes and families. Leaders foster a spirit of camaraderie in the Club and disputes are solved through duels — if you got a problem with someone, take it to the ring or keep it to yourself. Ecstatic motivational speeches serve as the Club’s sermons, instilling pride, loyalty, and feeling of unstoppable drive in those that listen.%0a%3c %0a%3c Mechanics%0a%3c • Recruit The first thing expected of initiates is to learn the basics of fighting.

The name itself means “The Family of Kali”, and they treat themselves as such. To the uninitiated, they’re surprisingly open to worship of any of the forms of Devi, though the official worship is focused around Kali herself.%0a> %0a> History%0a> That the Kalikula migrated to Portland from India is widely know. Brought over by Chandra and Indira, they remained relatively low-key until the war started to create massive casualties for most Kindred groups. However, once they went on the offensive in the War of the Four, the other factions learned to give the cult some respect, for their warriors were fanatical, six-armed zealots adept in striking hard and fast, leaving blood and terror behind them, both from the brutal killing style they followed, as well as the bodies that would go missing. Post-War, rather than return to being insular, the cult as remained active in vampire politics, their Hand of Preservation even going so far as to add service to the Ambassador to his list of responsibilities, while their Hand of Creation maintains her hold on Elysium.%0a> %0a> The Kalikula is organized down the three active energies of Brahman, Creation, Destruction, and Preservation. Each branch is responsible for various aspects of the Cult, and they work together as a whole very well. Broadly, the Preservation branch is responsible for defending the cult and its interests, the Destruction branch is responsible for destroying that which would threaten the cult and its interests, and the Creation branch is responsible for the creation and expanding of both the cult and its interests. Within that, is a tangled mess of responsibilities, where any task could really be given to any branch of the cult.%0a> %0a144,152c142,148%0a%3c When the Embassy was founded the Guild forced their way into a seat at the table- much to the consternation of the other factions. This was accomplished through the Guild’s goal of Identification- they brought with them an entire binder full of names, pseudonyms, and photos of almost every single member of the newly formed Embassy. Knowledge, not petty supernatural tricks, was the power that carried the day for them.%0a%3c %0a%3c Since the war, the guild has only grown and been split into chapters formed around various professions with the over goal of protecting mortals and the covert goal of continuing Identify and preferably gain leverage over other supernaturals. Each chapter actively recruits mortals, psychics, and other minor talents that don’t fall under the other factions’ aegis.%0a%3c %0a%3c Doctrine%0a%3c Detect. Identify. Protect.%0a%3c %0a%3c This is the Rose City Guild’s mission. Though the organization has its roots in the founding of Portland, the modern incarnation of the Guild came about during the War of the Four when professionals and businessmen came together with strategies to keep their communities safe from the supernatural menace. Through the 70s the Guild became more open to ‘Parapsychology’- psychic powers - and successfully recruited some of these people to help them protect humanity. When the war finally ended in 1980 The Rose City Guild was well established, well financed, and dedicated to keeping the city safe from the supernatural monsters of the city. They had also proven that the greatest powers one can have is organization, motivation, and knowledge.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> To follow and worship Devi in her form as Kali, as well as bring glory to her by sacrificing her enemies’ blood.%0a> %0a> Doctine%0a> The Kalikula have no hard doctrine. Rather, fanatical worship of Devi, however one personally chooses, is the primary method. Though all dedicants are encouraged to align with one of the three Active Energies of Brahman that represent Kali: Creation, Destruction, or Preservation. This Path is chosen at the time of Initiation, and cannot be changed.%0a> %0a> Status is a loose concept in the cult. With everyone being roughly equal to each other, the only real positions within the cult are those at the top. The Three Hands, and their Speaker. Currently, Chandra is both Speaker and the Hand of Creation, with Indira holding the Hand of Destruction.%0a> %0a154,167c150,159%0a%3c Though the RCG is a Mystery Cult, it does not count against the MCI cap or 5 dots, and all mortals may receive 1 free dot of Rose City Guild Initiation at Character Creation.%0a%3c %0a%3c • Members of the Guild know one another and gossip flows freely, they gain Contacts (RCG) (•)%0a%3c %0a%3c •• It’s a dangerous world and established members of the Guild have safe houses to retreat to when necessary.

At this point, a dedicant chooses their Ishta-Devi, or personal representation of Devi. Kali is always the suggested, but not required by the cult. One’s worship of Kali, and Devi through her, is personal after all. Anyone who is not a Circle of the Crone gains the Chorister merit. Those who have already formally joined the Circle of the Crone instead gain a dot of Occult.%0a> %0a> •••• Achaka At this level, you’ve been inducted into the rituals of the priesthood of Kali, and are responsible for helping to guide the mundane worship of your path.

As the Hippie Movement was spreading all across the country, psychics and pagan practitioners (both with and without legitimate powers) came together in Portland out of a desire for that similar sense of tribal community. Thought it was formed not long after the Rose City Guild, the Sisters existed outside the Guild. Many of them were not even aware of the Guild’s existence, not at first.%0a> %0a> The Sisters developed their Doctrine over the course of the decade as the membership grew into their powers and the national dialogue around women shifted after the publication of Friedan’s The Feminine Mystique. They became devoted to the success of their members, whatever form that success meant, and to the elimination of those who stood in the way of that success. In the public eye, the Sisters were outspoken activists at feminist protests and rallies, while in private they worked to hex the status quo. In the mid 1970s, however, the cult’s attention was diverted from the glass ceiling as the War of the Four spilled into the mortal lives of Portland.%0a> %0a> Six years ago, the cult ostensibly vanished when High Priestess Siobhan Walsh was found dead in her Crestwood home, which also served as the headquarters of the Fundament. The remaining sisters scattered to the winds, seeming to vanish off the grid overnight. Siobhan’s daughter, Juniper, has returned to Portland and begun to discover her mother’s secrets, including the Book of Shadows, the cult’s secret ritual space beneath the house, and the truth about what she thought was simply her mother’s coven. Though the cult has laid broken these past years, Juniper’s discoveries have led her to believe that it is time for a renaissance of the Fundament— especially as Portland’s nights grow more fraught with danger.%0a> %0a> Purpose%0a> By exploring the intersection of feminine power and spirituality, the Sisters of the Fundament provide a foundation of support while pushing the boundaries of the Self, achieving their Goals, and banishing Obstacles that stand in their way.%0a> %0a> Relic%0a> There is a Book of Shadows that has passed from one High Priestess to the next, containing in it the rites of the Fundament going back to its founding.%0a> %0a> Doctrine%0a> The Sisters are, first and foremost, devoted to each other’s success. Each Sister declares different Goals that they aspire to achieve and the Cult works with them to help make those Goals manifest. The Goals that each Sister declares can cover a wide variety of spheres, mundane or supernatural, physical or emotional. There are no wrong answers. One Sister’s Goal may be to bring more wealth into her life, another’s may be to expand her psychic abilities, while another may be to try and heal a psychological trauma that haunts her from the past. The Cult teaches that each Sister brings with her unique strengths and weaknesses, which should be celebrated. All of these, then, weave together to form the Fundament. As they believe that united they are stronger, the Sisterhood channels the Collective Power of the Fundament to help each Sister achieve her aspirations. When an Obstacle stands in the way of a Sister’s goal, or worse, a Sister is in danger, she can always count on the Fundament banding together to banish this threat to her success.%0a> %0a> Progression in the Sisterhood%0a> • Page of Cups. The Page of Cups, like the Pages in all the suits, represents some sort of beginning or renewal.

In the Ace of Wands, a hand reaches out from a cloud, as if a spiritual opportunity or offering is being made, to grasp a wand that is still flowering, growing and developing.

In the distance on the left, there is a castle that represents the promise of what opportunities may come.%0a> %0a> ••• Knight of Pentacles. The Knight of Pentacles, like the Knights of the other suits, represents work, effort, and the responsibility that follows upon the dreams of the Page. The Knight of Pentacles sits upon a heavy plough horse in the midst of a field. In his hands he carries a single gold coin. His eyes reflect careful thought and consideration. The Knight is engaged in the often toilsome, routine efforts required to realise the dreams of his heart. He is building the foundations to support his dreams and his goals.%0a> %0a> •••• Queen of Swords. The Queen of Swords sits high on her throne with a stern look on her face indicating that no-one can fool her. In her right hand, she comfortably holds a sword pointed to the sky, and her left hand extends as if she has something to offer to others. Behind her is a spring sky, different from the winter settings on most other Swords cards, and this has an emergence and growth quality to it. The sky is clear, representing her clarity of mind as she considers matters of the intellect. The bird above her head symbolises the mind’s ability to soar above day-to-day issues in order to arrive at appropriate solutions.%0a> %0a> ••••• High Priestess. The High Priestess is also known as Persephone, Isis, the Corn Maiden and Artemis. She sits at the gate before the great Mystery, as indicated by the Tree of Life in the background. She sits between the darkness and the light, represented by the pillars of Solomon’s temple, which suggests it is she who is the mediator of the passage into the depth of reality. The tapestry hung between the pillars keeps the casual onlookers out and allows only those initiated to enter. The pomegranates on the tapestry are sacred to Persephone. They are a symbol of duty (because Persephone ate a pomegranate seed in the underworld which forced her to return every year). The blue robe the Priestess is wearing is a symbol of knowledge. She is wearing the crown of Isis symbolising the Triple Goddess. The solar cross on her breast is a symbol of balance between male and female.%0a> %0a> Mechanics%0a> • Page of Cups.

The general belief of the Co-Op’s members is that there is strength to be found in unity and diversity. It is not uncommon for members to help each other with projects, research, or job searches.%0a%3c %0a%3c The building itself aids the Co-Op in it’s mission. The Co-Op benefits from its members living in a single building, thus reinforcing the close bonds formed between the members. Given the diverse needs of its membership, the Co-Op succeeds in large part due to the efforts of the mage and changeling who first struck a bargain in the creation of the building. The changeling and the Mastigos worked together to tie the building’s apartment doors to both the hedge and remote locations of the fallen world. While the actual details of the building’s creation are complex, the results are less so, although no less wondrous. The door to each member’s apartment, when opened with their key, leads to a living area best suited to their needs. For changelings this could be a hollow in the hedge, for a mage it could be a remote basement study with a small hallow, vampire’s rooms are almost universally havens away from any threat of sunlight, while some werewolves find forested dens guarding loci. Each ‘apartment’ is bounded by space magic, so that the only way in or out of the area is through the apartment door (although rarely the Hedge manages to shift a trod into the living area, such trods are almost always simply walking paths that loop back to the same living area). While not exactly common, it is neither rare for a minor spirit or an experiment-gone-awry to escape someone’s apartment and pass through the halls of the Co-Op. Usually the intruder is stopped my supernatural defenses, or else by other members. Such disruptions are minor, but keep things interesting in the day-to-day. Fortunately, the building also prevents pure mortals from noticing or remembering the odd goings-on in the main areas.%0a%3c %0a%3c As members become more well-known and earn renown among their peers for their helpfulness to the other members, they often become a bit more entrenched in supernatural affairs, and it becomes necessary to either separate their mortal and supernatural identities, or else to strengthen their bond to their humanity so as to maintain the balance needed to live such a life with their morals and sanity intact. Eventually the most notable members manage to collect trinkets and items of power from their fellow Co-Op members, and even learn to activate those items with their own internal powers as they internalize some of the diversity of their group.%0a%3c %0a%3c Purpose%0a%3c The Co-op is a group dedicated to aiding one another to mutual benefit. Living proof that the whole can be more than the sum of it’s parts, the Co-Op is made of members determined to use their unique talents, insights, and abilities, to aid those who have pledged themselves to do the same. In doing so, members not only excel in their own endeavors, but learn more about the other factions as well.%0a%3c %0a%3c Relic%0a%3c Much of the Co-Op focuses around a magical building in the Unaligned District. While not a relic, per se, it is a wondrous place integral to the cohesiveness and success of the Co-Op.%0a%3c %0a%3c Doctrine%0a%3c The Code of The Co-Op%0a%3c “Now this is the Code of The Co-Op, which every member must know,%0a%3c And the one who keeps it will prosper, but the one who breaks it shall go.%0a%3c As the Willamette flows through Portland, the code goes on without stop;%0a%3c The success of the Co-Op’s the members; the member’s success the Co-Op.%0a%3c Give aid to your fellow members, for they will aid you in return%0a%3c Through cooperative effort and help from each other, each member can thrive and can learn.%0a%3c The room of the member is the member’s, and none this sanctum shall breach;%0a%3c The whole of the building is the Co-Op’s, however, owned and protected by each.%0a%3c Do not inform on your neighbors, nor to mortals their secrets reveal;%0a%3c Visitors of factions are welcome, if they don’t cause hostile zeal.%0a%3c Withhold not your knowledge nor power, from those who share this our abode,%0a%3c For to do what you can to strengthen each other is the goal of the Code.”%0a%3c Mechanics%0a%3c The Co-Op is open to membership from full supernatural template characters only (so currently Changelings, Werewolves, Mages, and Vampires):%0a%3c %0a%3c • The newest members have around-the-clock access to the Co-Op’s safe house. The building is a safe haven for all members to gather and learn from one another. They gain one dot in Safe Place as a shared merit split between all of the Co-Op’s members.%0a%3c •• As members become more integrated into life at the Co-Op, they often move into one of the numerous magically-accessed apartments. These apartments are not exactly in the building, per se, but they can only be entered and exited through the building, and customize their co-located position according to the needs and desires of their occupants. Members at this level gain one dot in a location-based merit appropriate to their faction, such as sanctum, haven, hollow, or den.%0a%3c ••• Once members have begun to live together, they have more opportunity to benefit from the knowledge and contacts of their fellow members. Oftentimes their fellow members aid them in making new contacts and friends around the city (either in the mortal world or the supernatural one) or in finding jobs where they can put their particular talents to good use. They gain 2 dots in any combination, split between Contacts, Allies, and Resources.%0a%3c •••• As members become further embroiled in their supernatural lives, and also gain ties to the community around the Co-Op, it becomes necessary for them to work to help each other better balance their mortal and supernatural lives. They gain 3 dots in merits appropriate to helping maintain that balance or divide in their lives: Alternate Identity, Shadow Name, Many Mask, Touchstone, Blood and Bone Affinity (Bone only), and Anchored. The chosen merits must be ones available to the member’s faction.%0a%3c ••••• As a member reaches the highest level of integration within the Co-Op, the differences between his own supernatural abilities and those of his fellow Co-Op members become less meaningful and divisive. The member gains 3 dots of item merits from factions that are not his own: Enhanced Item, Imbued Item, Fetish, Token, Hedgespun, Artifact, or similar merits at ST discretion. Furthermore, a member at this level is now able to use his own power stat (gnosis, blood potency, wyrd, primal urge) and power source (mana, blood, glamour, essence) to activate supernatural devices. Any stat for which there is no equivalent for (e.g., a mage using a Fetish that references his Honor rating) is treated as a 1.%0a%3c %0a%3c Contact%0a%3c Drake Roberts%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Heralds of the Void%0a%3c (Open Membership)%0a%3c %0a%3c “You’re special, you know. So few are brought to the central chamber. So few get to touch the Black Stone. So few are truly worthy of The Void’s wisdom. At least, receiving it so directly. But they’ve been watching you. They told me you’re ready. Ready to see just what you’ve been working towards. The transcendence you’re so close to achieving.%0a%3c Just this way. Through the hall, and into the door on the left. It’s locked, but it will open for you. Nobody else should be in there. It will be on the altar. You’ll know it. A simple touch, and you’ll hear it. Trust me when I say it will change you forever.%0a%3c Me? No, I’m not coming with you. It’s something you have to do alone. But don’t fret. You wouldn’t be doing this if They didn’t already know you were ready for it….”%0a%3c %0a%3c The Heralds of the Void are a Cult built around the Renatus Dynasty’s message of spiritual transformation and occult knowledge. With the right information, you can transcend. With the right knowledge, you’ll be capable of anything. With the right support, you can make full use of what Power you have. Of course, few know of their true benefactors behind the scene.%0a%3c %0a%3c Unlike the Renatus Kindred themselves, however, they usually only hear The Void in one of two ways: speaking with a member of the Dynasty (who lead the Cult, of course), or being allowed to Commune with it through the Black Stone, a relic of sorts at the center of the Cult that allows a temporary connection with The Void directly. A dangerous thing for a living mind.%0a%3c %0a%3c Purpose%0a%3c The Renatus Dynasty (a Mekhet lineage) leads the Heralds of The Void, who can be made up of other Kindred, mortals, and other supernatural individuals, towards a sort of preternatural enlightenment focused on sharpening one’s supernatural abilities in order to strengthen the soul and one’s overall potency.%0a%3c %0a%3c Doctrine%0a%3c The general goals of the Dynasty and Cult involve a sort of warped version of the Ordo Dracul’s creed, a transcendence past one’s limitations through whatever knowledge can be put to that use. Supernatural power is encouraged, through whatever means, so long as you don’t harm your own growth or that of the rest of the Cult/Dynasty.%0a%3c %0a%3c Overall, the Cult’s members are expected to have access to each other for assistance in developing their abilities, whatever they may be, and will often be temporarily grouped together by those in higher positions for the sake of matching those that need assistance with those most likely to be capable of providing that sort of help. Those of lower initiation are expected to follow groupings decided upon by those higher up (often members of the Dynasty itself).%0a%3c %0a%3c In addition to these ‘internal’ methods of improvement, members are all expected to use whatever contacts and means they have to learn of Occult relics, artifacts, tomes, and other potential sources of knowledge or supernatural potency, provide that information to the Heralds’ leaders and to each other, and then ultimately to retrieve them in the case of physical items. The exact methods of coming into such things varies between members, but little care is generally given for the legality involved.%0a%3c %0a%3c Finally, all cultists are expected to keep the secrets of other members from the outside world, unless explicit permission is given to provide such information. This isn’t just supernatural secrets, like psychic capabilities or faction affiliation, it includes personal weaknesses, criminal history, and whatever else might come up.%0a%3c %0a%3c Ties to the setting%0a%3c The Renatus are said to be inherently distrustful to the point of near-hatred with regards to Invictus Vampires, due to a past rivalry with a failed dynasty aligned with that covenant. They’ve since left, but the Kindred within the Heralds, and sometimes the more knowledgeable members of other factions, still tend to distrust the Invictus.%0a%3c %0a%3c Mechanics%0a%3c Availability: Kindred involved in the cult (ideally most), most ghouls, and all mortals/supernaturals will use the Mystery Cult Initiation merit, with mechanics as shown below:%0a%3c %0a%3c • Initiates are clued in to some hidden aspect of the world, or are made to further the experience they already have. They gain an Occult specialty of their choice.%0a%3c %0a%3c •• Those Adepts that have taken their first significant steps towards transcending their limitations learn to apply what they’ve learned to all aspects of themselves.

They gain Unseen Sense (Mortal Sleepwalkers) (To clarify: It triggers for those with supernatural merits and lesser templates, not all supernaturals)%0a%3c %0a%3c •••• Those ghouled and more powerful mortal leaders, the Speakers, that have begun to learn of the Dynasty, directing the less informed in their name and organizing its day to day affairs, learn to draw others in and make it clear just what the Void can offer, or how it can improve you. They gain the Inspiring merit.%0a%3c %0a%3c ••••• The Enlightened. Only Kindred may have this level of initiation, though that’s not always known by those seeking it out. While all Dynasty members have a sense for The Void, only those that truly work towards its ends garner any real attention. This represents that attention. In addition to whatever information it might provide on its own (Narrator discretion), once per chapter (week) it will provide directly applicable information about any character, visible location, the current situation, or otherwise that can be asked in a yes/no fashion by the PLAYER (the character doesn’t need to be seeking it specifically, the player decides what the void is going to show them). This requires no roll or expenditure.%0a%3c %0a%3c NOTE: This is not to say a mortal can’t reach this peak.

The name itself means “The Family of Kali”, and they treat themselves as such. To the uninitiated, they’re surprisingly open to worship of any of the forms of Devi, though the official worship is focused around Kali herself.%0a%3c %0a%3c History%0a%3c That the Kalikula migrated to Portland from India is widely know. Brought over by Chandra and Indira, they remained relatively low-key until the war started to create massive casualties for most Kindred groups. However, once they went on the offensive in the War of the Four, the other factions learned to give the cult some respect, for their warriors were fanatical, six-armed zealots adept in striking hard and fast, leaving blood and terror behind them, both from the brutal killing style they followed, as well as the bodies that would go missing. Post-War, rather than return to being insular, the cult as remained active in vampire politics, their Hand of Preservation even going so far as to add service to the Ambassador to his list of responsibilities, while their Hand of Creation maintains her hold on Elysium.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Kalikula is organized down the three active energies of Brahman, Creation, Destruction, and Preservation. Each branch is responsible for various aspects of the Cult, and they work together as a whole very well. Broadly, the Preservation branch is responsible for defending the cult and its interests, the Destruction branch is responsible for destroying that which would threaten the cult and its interests, and the Creation branch is responsible for the creation and expanding of both the cult and its interests. Within that, is a tangled mess of responsibilities, where any task could really be given to any branch of the cult.%0a%3c %0a%3c Purpose%0a%3c To follow and worship Devi in her form as Kali, as well as bring glory to her by sacrificing her enemies’ blood.%0a%3c %0a%3c Doctine%0a%3c The Kalikula have no hard doctrine. Rather, fanatical worship of Devi, however one personally chooses, is the primary method. Though all dedicants are encouraged to align with one of the three Active Energies of Brahman that represent Kali: Creation, Destruction, or Preservation. This Path is chosen at the time of Initiation, and cannot be changed.%0a%3c %0a%3c Status is a loose concept in the cult. With everyone being roughly equal to each other, the only real positions within the cult are those at the top. The Three Hands, and their Speaker. Currently, Chandra is both Speaker and the Hand of Creation, with Indira holding the Hand of Destruction.%0a%3c %0a%3c Mechanics%0a%3c • Initiate At this level, you’ve freshly joined the cult. As an Initiate, you’re allowed to enter the compound for worship, and encouraged to choose a path to follow. You gain a specialty based on your Path: Those that follow Creation gain a specialty in Crafts of their choice, those that follow Destruction gain a specialty in either Brawl or Melee based on their chosen method of war, those that follow Preservation gain one dot in Trained Observer.%0a%3c %0a%3c •• Dedicant At this level, you’re formally welcomed into the Compound, and given a place to stay. You attend all the worship sessions for those as a whole, as well as those for your chosen path.

At this point, a dedicant chooses their Ishta-Devi, or personal representation of Devi. Kali is always the suggested, but not required by the cult. One’s worship of Kali, and Devi through her, is personal after all. Anyone who is not a Circle of the Crone gains the Chorister merit. Those who have already formally joined the Circle of the Crone instead gain a dot of Occult.%0a%3c %0a%3c •••• Achaka At this level, you’ve been inducted into the rituals of the priesthood of Kali, and are responsible for helping to guide the mundane worship of your path. Characters at this level who do not already have Altar (Kalikula Compound) receive it. Those characters that already have the Altar merit, who follow the Path of Preservation, gain 3 dots in Temple Guardian. Those who follow the Path of Creation, gain 3 dots in the Primal Creation Cruac Style, while those who follow the Path of Destruction gain 3 dots in the Opening of the Void Cruac Style.%0a%3c %0a%3c ••••• Purohita At this level, you’re expected to guide the worship of the Cult as a whole. As one of the Chief Priests, you’re also expected to help with the cult’s Cruac. As a Kindred, to lead it, otherwise, you’re expected to participate every time without fail. However, this is not without its own blessings. When using the teamwork rules for Cruac rituals, so long as your character is leading the ritual, you do not double the time necessary to make the roll, nor do you double the time between rolls if participating members have no dots in Cruac. However, rather than using the highest Cruac rating of the group, the ritual uses your Cruac rating, as you lead the cult in the ritual.

Rigorous exercise regimens culminate in bare-knuckled brawls, often leaving participants with bruises and scrapes as they return to their homes and families. Leaders foster a spirit of camaraderie in the Club and disputes are solved through duels — if you got a problem with someone, take it to the ring or keep it to yourself. Ecstatic motivational speeches serve as the Club’s sermons, instilling pride, loyalty, and feeling of unstoppable drive in those that listen.%0a%3c %0a%3c Mechanics%0a%3c • Recruit The first thing expected of initiates is to learn the basics of fighting.

Through the 70s the Guild became more open to ‘Parapsychology’- psychic powers - and successfully recruited some of these people to help them protect humanity. When the war finally ended in 1980 The Rose City Guild was well established, well financed, and dedicated to keeping the city safe from the supernatural monsters of the city.

This material wealth confers 3 dots of resources; additionally, a Grand Master may make a Resources ••••• purchase once per month by drawing on the cult’s coffers.%0a%3c %0a%3c Contact%0a%3c Cinn, randomim%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c The Temple of Inner Illumination%0a%3c (Open.)%0a%3c %0a%3c Purpose%0a%3c The Temple of Inner Illumination is a spiritual (but non-religious) cult that promotes inner peace and enlightenment through meditation, martial training, and service to the community. Based loosely on traditional tropes of Shao-lin and other eastern sects, the Temple is, quietly, a Silver Ladder Cryptopoly, with the goal of guiding promising students to Awakening through the practices of the temple.%0a%3c %0a%3c Cultists - Serious Martial Arts students, Wuxia fans, Scared Citizens Wanting to learn self defense, Anxious office workers needing meditation.%0a%3c %0a%3c Mechanics%0a%3c • 1 dot of Meditative Mind Merit (may be combined with purchased dots of same merit).

Keep pure your highest ideal; strive ever toward it; let naught stop you or turn you aside.” %0a%3c - Charge of the Goddess, Doreen Valiente%0a%3c %0a%3c History%0a%3c The Sisters of the Fundament were founded in the advent of the Witchcraft Revival of the 1960s, which came hand-in-hand with Second Wave Feminism in a messy, glorious explosion of the exploration of femininity and spiritual tribalism. As the Hippie Movement was spreading all across the country, psychics and pagan practitioners (both with and without legitimate powers) came together in Portland out of a desire for that similar sense of tribal community. Thought it was formed not long after the Rose City Guild, the Sisters existed outside the Guild. Many of them were not even aware of the Guild’s existence, not at first.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Sisters developed their Doctrine over the course of the decade as the membership grew into their powers and the national dialogue around women shifted after the publication of Friedan’s The Feminine Mystique. They became devoted to the success of their members, whatever form that success meant, and to the elimination of those who stood in the way of that success. In the public eye, the Sisters were outspoken activists at feminist protests and rallies, while in private they worked to hex the status quo. In the mid 1970s, however, the cult’s attention was diverted from the glass ceiling as the War of the Four spilled into the mortal lives of Portland.%0a%3c %0a%3c Six years ago, the cult ostensibly vanished when High Priestess Siobhan Walsh was found dead in her Crestwood home, which also served as the headquarters of the Fundament. The remaining sisters scattered to the winds, seeming to vanish off the grid overnight. Siobhan’s daughter, Juniper, has returned to Portland and begun to discover her mother’s secrets, including the Book of Shadows, the cult’s secret ritual space beneath the house, and the truth about what she thought was simply her mother’s coven. Though the cult has laid broken these past years, Juniper’s discoveries have led her to believe that it is time for a renaissance of the Fundament— especially as Portland’s nights grow more fraught with danger.%0a%3c %0a%3c Purpose%0a%3c By exploring the intersection of feminine power and spirituality, the Sisters of the Fundament provide a foundation of support while pushing the boundaries of the Self, achieving their Goals, and banishing Obstacles that stand in their way.%0a%3c %0a%3c Relic%0a%3c There is a Book of Shadows that has passed from one High Priestess to the next, containing in it the rites of the Fundament going back to its founding.%0a%3c %0a%3c Doctrine%0a%3c The Sisters are, first and foremost, devoted to each other’s success. Each Sister declares different Goals that they aspire to achieve and the Cult works with them to help make those Goals manifest. The Goals that each Sister declares can cover a wide variety of spheres, mundane or supernatural, physical or emotional. There are no wrong answers. One Sister’s Goal may be to bring more wealth into her life, another’s may be to expand her psychic abilities, while another may be to try and heal a psychological trauma that haunts her from the past. The Cult teaches that each Sister brings with her unique strengths and weaknesses, which should be celebrated. All of these, then, weave together to form the Fundament. As they believe that united they are stronger, the Sisterhood channels the Collective Power of the Fundament to help each Sister achieve her aspirations. When an Obstacle stands in the way of a Sister’s goal, or worse, a Sister is in danger, she can always count on the Fundament banding together to banish this threat to her success.%0a%3c %0a%3c Progression in the Sisterhood%0a%3c • Page of Cups. The Page of Cups, like the Pages in all the suits, represents some sort of beginning or renewal. The Page of Cups indicates the surprising and unexpected nature of inspiration that comes to us from the realm of the unconscious and the spirit. Inspiration is seen to be something which comes upon us most unexpectedly and often in a manner which we do not understand.%0a%3c %0a%3c •• Ace of Wands. In the Ace of Wands, a hand reaches out from a cloud, as if a spiritual opportunity or offering is being made, to grasp a wand that is still flowering, growing and developing. The leaves floating down with the wind signify material and spiritual progress and balance. In the distance on the left, there is a castle that represents the promise of what opportunities may come.%0a%3c %0a%3c ••• Knight of Pentacles. The Knight of Pentacles, like the Knights of the other suits, represents work, effort, and the responsibility that follows upon the dreams of the Page. The Knight of Pentacles sits upon a heavy plough horse in the midst of a field. In his hands he carries a single gold coin. His eyes reflect careful thought and consideration. The Knight is engaged in the often toilsome, routine efforts required to realise the dreams of his heart. He is building the foundations to support his dreams and his goals.%0a%3c %0a%3c •••• Queen of Swords. The Queen of Swords sits high on her throne with a stern look on her face indicating that no-one can fool her. In her right hand, she comfortably holds a sword pointed to the sky, and her left hand extends as if she has something to offer to others. Behind her is a spring sky, different from the winter settings on most other Swords cards, and this has an emergence and growth quality to it. The sky is clear, representing her clarity of mind as she considers matters of the intellect. The bird above her head symbolises the mind’s ability to soar above day-to-day issues in order to arrive at appropriate solutions.%0a%3c %0a%3c ••••• High Priestess. The High Priestess is also known as Persephone, Isis, the Corn Maiden and Artemis. She sits at the gate before the great Mystery, as indicated by the Tree of Life in the background. She sits between the darkness and the light, represented by the pillars of Solomon’s temple, which suggests it is she who is the mediator of the passage into the depth of reality. The tapestry hung between the pillars keeps the casual onlookers out and allows only those initiated to enter. The pomegranates on the tapestry are sacred to Persephone. They are a symbol of duty (because Persephone ate a pomegranate seed in the underworld which forced her to return every year). The blue robe the Priestess is wearing is a symbol of knowledge. She is wearing the crown of Isis symbolising the Triple Goddess. The solar cross on her breast is a symbol of balance between male and female.%0a%3c %0a%3c Mechanics%0a%3c • Page of Cups.
