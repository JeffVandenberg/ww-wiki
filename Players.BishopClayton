A small ridge of fur runs down his spine growing in the opposite direction and his muzzle is marred in black with bright white fangs and black, shimmering claws.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25white%25In his wolf form, Bishop maintains fiery amber eyes and his black and golden coat. The ridge of reverse growing fur remains down his spine and he stands about three and a half feet at the shoulder. His form is lean but powerful, much like his normal cousins. %0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=5px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=250px height=350px%25https://i.imgur.com/kcolGUD.jpg%0a---%0a> %25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=250px height=350px%25https://i.imgur.com/j9yZS69.jpg%0a> !%25werewolf%25 Appearance: %0a> %0a> !%25werewolf%25 History:%0a>  %0a65,71c61,67%0a%3c %25werewolf%25'''Right Tool for the Job(Werewolves):''' Bishop is an accomplished fetish-crafter, whether it's something everyone knows about or something wholly new and unexpected, there's a chance he can find, trap and bind the spirits you need.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25werewolf%25'''Coach Clayton(Everyone):''' Bishop used to call Sumpter Oregon home for many years where he was a teacher coach for their small Football and Baseball teams. Never the best, but they always played hard. Perhaps you went there, or played them in your formative years and remember the loud, aggressive coach whose players loved him.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25werewolf%25'''Eye for the Strange:(Everyone)''' This new wolf has a taste for every supernatural from the simplest Ghost to the worlds beyond where all manner of monsters live and spends a lot of time in the Occult section of libraries and bookstores. Most of it's rubbish, but just occasionally he finds something good. Wanna talk shop? You might find him.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25werewolf%25'''The Great Hunt:(Werewolves/Blood Talons)''' Bishop has a burning hatred for all things Pure including their totems and spirit allies. He describes himself in a constant state of hunting. Have any tips on the Pure or their allies, then Bishop will no doubt tag along to see them properly treated.%0a---%0a> %25werewolf%25%0a> %0a> %25werewolf%25%0a> %0a> %25werewolf%25%0a> %0a> %25werewolf%25%0a
