Her eyes are a pale green-bluish mosaic, their pigments shifting in hues that resist definement; at best, they could be likened to dewy grass in a cold spring morning. She has a pretty face with cheekbones like a model's, high and elegant, and yet there is something distant and cautious about her; her expression tends towards overly serious, and there is a desolation in her gaze that never quite goes away. Amber's figure is lean and fit, still maintaining the physique she developed in the army. A viscious, discoloured scar curves outwards from the small of her back and another one descends from just below her right shoulder blade, both of them stab wounds. An intense smattering of smaller, older scars covers the side of her right calf, faded white marks left by a violent sleet of metallic debris. Though these war wounds are forever part of her, she never feels quite as self-conscious or uneasy as when strangers can see those scars — even on the hottest days of summer she adapts her wardrobe to cover them up.%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]] %0a!!! %25mortal%25 History:%0aHistory goes here.%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]] %0a!!! %25mortal%25 Role Playing Hooks:%0aRole playing hooks goes here.%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]] %0a!!! %25mortal%25 Contacts:%0aContacts goes here.%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]] %0a!!! %25mortal%25 Quotes:%0a%0a''"Only the dead have seen the end of war."'' %25mortal%25 - Plato%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]] [[%3c%3c]] %0a(:keywords mortal, PC:)%0a(:include GameRef.Directoryplayermortal:)
