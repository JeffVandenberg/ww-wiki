She is the person the people on the street meet: the flaxen-haired girl, on her way to work, or maybe to studies. They see the plastic packaging, the flimsy wrapper, but the real me exists somewhere deep inside, beneath the polished exterior. Fuck. Why do I feel so out of place? When is it going to get better?''%0a%0aAmber is a typical Florida girl-next-door, a year-round tan caressing her skin and her blonde sunbleached hair worn in a simple side braid. Her eyes are a pale green-bluish mosaic, their pigments shifting in hues that resist definement; at best, their colour could be likened to dewy grass in a cold spring morning. She has a pretty face with cheekbones like a model's, high and elegant, and yet there is something distant and cautious about her; her expression tends towards overly serious, and there is a desolation in her gaze that never quite goes away. Amber's figure is lean and fit, still maintaining the physique she developed in the army. A viscious, discoloured scar curves outwards from the small of her back and another one descends from just below her right shoulder blade, both of them stab wounds. The outside of her right calf is covered in an intense smattering of smaller, older scars, faded white marks left by a violent sleet of metallic debris. Though these war wounds are forever part of her, she never feels quite as self-conscious or uneasy as when strangers can see them — she adapts her wardrobe to cover up her scars even on the hottest of summer days.%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]] %0a!!! %25mortal%25 History:%0a%0a''I have seen things people wouldn't believe — that '''no one''' would believe. And I don't mean the dystopian vistas of war, but stuff made of nightmares come alive. There are monsters in the night, monsters under the bed, and no one knows. No one wants to know. So I ask myself over and over: am I crazy, or do I just live in a crazy society? It terrifies me that I don't know the answer.''%0a%0aAmber is a child of the privileged white suburban middle-class, church-going, hard-working, and raised with conservative Republican values. Her father unironically wears a ''Make America Great Again'' cap even though he would have preferred Ted Cruz in the White House; after all, the division and controversies surrounding the presidential office reflects poorly on the party as a whole. Amber's childhood was nothing short of an idyllic all-American upbringing: summer barbecues, cheerleading camps, winter vacations in the Rockies, and so on.

When questioned by local authorities, she described it first as some sort of wolf-like man, and then maybe a bear, with terrible glowing eyes and fingers that ended in long, gruesome claws. Amber was in shock, her statements wildly inconsistent, and, perhaps more compelling, what she saw simply ''could not be real''; she was mistaken; her mind had been playing tricks on her; she had been hallucinating; or it was just a coping mechanism.

It terrifies me that I don't know the answer.''%0a%3c %0a%3c Amber is a child of the privileged white suburban middle-class America, church-going, hard-working, and raised with conservative Republican values. Her father unironically wears a ''Make America Great Again'' cap even though he would have preferred Mitt Romney in the White House — after all, the division and controversies surrounding the presidential office reflects poorly on the party as a whole. Her childhood was the idyllic all-American upbringing so often portrayed on television shows: summer barbecues, cheerleading camps, winter vacations in the Rockies, and so on. She was twelve years old when the unthinkable happened. The newspapers would later report it as a savage animal attack, but Amber had witnessed something else entirely. %0a%3c %0a%3c On a trip out of state with some family friends, she witnessed a terrible beast - half man and half monster - attack and kill both her aunt and her best friend. When questioned by local authorities, she described it first as some sort of wolf-like man, and then maybe a bear, with terrible glowing eyes and fingers that ended in long, gruesome claws. Amber was in shock, her statements wildly inconsistent, and, perhaps more compelling, what she saw simply ''could not be real'', and that was also what she was told; she was mistaken; her mind had been playing tricks on her; she had been hallucinating; or it was just a coping mechanism. When the whole world insisted she was wrong, when she was taken to councelling and given medication because she was wrong, she started to accept that her truth was not the real truth, and her memories of the event were eventually repressed.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> History goes here.%0a
