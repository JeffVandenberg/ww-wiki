She is the person the people on the street meet: the flaxen-haired girl, on her way to work, or maybe to studies. They see the plastic packaging, the flimsy wrapper, but the real me exists somewhere deep inside, beneath the polished exterior. Fuck. Why do I feel so out of place? When is it going to get better?''%0a%0aAmber is a typical Florida girl-next-door, a year-round tan caressing her skin and her blonde sunbleached hair worn in a simple side braid. Her eyes are a pale green-bluish mosaic, their pigments shifting in hues that resist definement; at best, their colour could be likened to dewy grass in a cold spring morning. She has a pretty face with cheekbones like a model's, high and elegant, and yet there is something distant and cautious about her; her expression tends towards overly serious and there is a desolation in her gaze that never quite goes away. Amber's figure is lean and fit, still maintaining the physique she developed in the army. A viscious, discoloured scar curves outwards from the small of her back and another one descends from just below her right shoulder blade, both of them stab wounds. The outside of her right calf is covered in an intense smattering of smaller, older scars, faded white marks left by a violent sleet of metallic debris. Though these war wounds are forever part of her, she never feels quite as self-conscious or uneasy as when strangers can see them — she adapts her wardrobe to cover up her scars even on the hottest of summer days.%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]] %0a!!! %25mortal%25 History:%0a''I have seen things people wouldn't believe — that '''no one''' would believe. And I don't mean the dystopian vistas of war, but stuff made of nightmares come alive. There are monsters in the night, monsters under the bed, and no one knows. No one wants to know. So I ask myself over and over: am I crazy, or do I just live in a crazy society? It terrifies me that I don't know the answer.''%0a%0aAmber is a child of the privileged white suburban middle-class, church-going, hard-working, and raised with conservative Republican values. Her father unironically wears a ''Make America Great Again'' cap even though he would have preferred Ted Cruz in the White House; after all, the division and controversies surrounding the presidential office reflects poorly on the party as a whole. Amber's childhood was nothing short of an idyllic all-American upbringing: summer barbecues, cheerleading camps, winter vacations in the Rockies, and so on. She was twelve years old when the unthinkable happened. The newspapers would later report it as a savage animal attack, but she had seen something else entirely. %0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=10px border='2px solid #6e68a3' width=305 margin-right=0px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=10px newwin%25 [[https://i.imgur.com/sknuY7s.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/sknuY7s.jpg]]%0a%0aOn a trip out of state with some family friends, she witnessed a terrible beast - half man and half monster - attack and kill both her aunt and her best friend. When questioned by local authorities, she described it first as some sort of wolf-like man, and then maybe a bear, with terrible glowing eyes and fingers that ended in long, gruesome claws. Amber was in shock, her statements wildly inconsistent, and, perhaps more compelling, what she saw simply ''could not be real''; she was mistaken; her mind had been playing tricks on her; she had been hallucinating; or it was just a coping mechanism. When the whole world insisted she was wrong, when she was taken to counseling and given medication because she was wrong, she started to accept that her truth was not the real truth, and her memories of the event were eventually repressed.%0a%0aIt was with both great pride and a great many complaints that Amber enlisted in the military as the first woman of the family. Serving in the armed forces was a time-honoured tradition in the family, stretching back to Korea, Vietnam, and even the World Wars; it was seen as the ultimate sacrifice to the great American nation and its people. Amber thrived in the military, enjoying the comraderie and the sense of duty and purpose it instilled in her. She spent her first tour of duty in Iraq, followed by another two in Afghanistan, experiencing firsthand the hardships of soldiery — the perpetual stress, the loss of close friends, and the exposure to turmoil and violence were the less glamorous parts of the job description.  %0a[[%3c%3c]] %0aAfter almost six years, Amber's military career came to an end in the inhospitable mountains of the Near East, her retirement prompted by another close encounter with the supernatural. Her unit was ambushed and savaged by a small group of bestial creatures - perhaps a pack, perhaps a coterie, or perhaps something else entirely - and she was the only survivor. This time, she ''knew'' she was not wrong; she ''had'' seen something terrible and monstrous, something that was truly inhuman. And once again, no one would believe her when she tried to explain that monsters are real. After a series of psychological evaluations, Amber was honourably discharged on medical grounds, sent home to Miami after her so-called episode of acute psychosis. Her reintegration into civilian life has been anything but seamless.%0a%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]] %0a!!! %25mortal%25 Role Playing Hooks:%0a''The truth is out there. The thought reverberates inside my head, insistent and relentless. I was never a fan of the X-Files, but now I understand Muller's underlying desperation in his search for answers. And even after everything that has happened, I still second-guess myself. Am I wasting my life chasing after figments of my imagination?''%0a%0a%25mortal%25 '''''Donning the tinfoil hat (anyone):''''' \\%0a%25%25 Amber spends a significant amount of her free time on conspiracy theory websites, connecting with people who also have experienced the inexplicable. She goes through the local newspapers with a fine-tooth comb, looking for anything weird or out of place, trying to piece together evidence of paranormal phenomena. Anyone that openly entertains the notion that the supernatural might exist runs the risk of being subjected to her findings.%0a%0a%25mortal%25 '''''A devout member of the faith (anyone):'''''\\%0a%25%25 The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. He makes me to lie down in green pastures: he leads me beside the still waters. He restores my soul: he leads me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for you are with me; your rod and your staff they comfort me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies: you anoint my head with oil; my cup runs over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=0px width=330 border='2px solid #6e68a3' margin-right=10px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=0px newwin%25 [[https://i.ibb.co/jD6VDHC/oie-rounded-corners.gif|https://i.ibb.co/jD6VDHC/oie-rounded-corners.gif]]%0a%25mortal%25 '''''Campus girl (anyone):'''''\\%0a%25%25 Amber has a special aptitude for languages, speaking several foreign languages and American Sign Language fluently. She is currently enrolled at the University of Miami, taking various classes that would enable her to pursue a career as a translator or interpreter. Recently, she has made an effort to involve herself more in the extracurricular activities offered by the university.%0a%0a%25mortal%25 '''''The right to bear arms (anyone):'''''\\%0a%25%25 It is the God-given right of the American people to keep and bear arms; Amber often frequents gun clubs, gun shops, and firearms expositions. While unloading a clip of bullets into a paper target at the shooting range isn't going to solve any of her problems, it certainly has a way of making her feel a bit better about them. It also is a fine way of making new acquaintances.%0a%0a%25mortal%25 '''''Looking to make a quick buck (anyone):'''''\\%0a%25%25 The list of expenditures keeps on piling high: school fees, class litteratures, rent, therapy, utilities, internet, and so on and so forth. Even with working two jobs and taking student loans, Amber is struggling to pay all her bills on time every month. Any opportunity to earn some extra money would pique her interest.%0a%0a%25mortal%25 '''''Something to soothe the nerves (medicine/crime):'''''\\%0a%25%25 Amber returned home from from her deployment overseas bearing traumas unseen, suffering from panic attacks, chronic insomnia, and other stress-related symptoms. She has been prescribed variety of drugs by different doctors from across the state, sometimes by resorting to feigning or exaggerating ailments. Benzodiazepines, opiods, sleeping pills, and anti-depressants help her through those days when life itself just feels overwhelming. Most of the times she manages to get her prescriptions refilled by licensed doctors or pyschiatrists, but in dire situations she has resorted to more illicit methods.%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]] %0a!!! %25mortal%25 Contacts:%0a%0a(:cellnr width=50%25 align=left style='padding-left: 0px;':)%0a%25lfloat text-align=center width=180 margin-top=0px border='2px solid #8666cc' margin-right=7px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=8px newwin%25 [[https://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/Players/SecondCircle|https://i.imgur.com/wqCxCUf.jpg]] %25beast newwin%25 [[https://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/Players/SecondCircle|'''Second Circle:''']]%0a%0a%25beast%25 '' "No man understands hospitality better than'' %25newwin%25 ''[[https://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/Players/JeremiahHamilton|Jeremiah]] %25beast%25 and it truly shows at the %25newwin%25 [[https://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/Players/SecondCircle|The Second Circle]]%25beast%25.

It terrifies me that I don't know the answer.''%0a%3c %0a%3c Amber is a child of the privileged white suburban middle-class America, church-going, hard-working, and raised with conservative Republican values. Her father unironically wears a ''Make America Great Again'' cap even though he would have preferred Mitt Romney in the White House — after all, the division and controversies surrounding the presidential office reflects poorly on the party as a whole. Her childhood was the idyllic all-American upbringing so often portrayed on television shows: summer barbecues, cheerleading camps, winter vacations in the Rockies, and so on. She was twelve years old when the unthinkable happened. The newspapers would later report it as a savage animal attack, but Amber had witnessed something else entirely. %0a%3c %0a%3c On a trip out of state with some family friends, she witnessed a terrible beast - half man and half monster - attack and kill both her aunt and her best friend. When questioned by local authorities, she described it first as some sort of wolf-like man, and then maybe a bear, with terrible glowing eyes and fingers that ended in long, gruesome claws. Amber was in shock, her statements wildly inconsistent, and, perhaps more compelling, what she saw simply ''could not be real'', and that was also what she was told; she was mistaken; her mind had been playing tricks on her; she had been hallucinating; or it was just a coping mechanism. When the whole world insisted she was wrong, when she was taken to councelling and given medication because she was wrong, she started to accept that her truth was not the real truth, and her memories of the event were eventually repressed.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> History goes here.%0a
