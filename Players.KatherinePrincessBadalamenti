Her dark brown hair with chocolate highlights descends to her mid-back, matching her manicured dark brows. A regular forest of dark brown freckles dusts her nose and cheekbones generously, with a gentle dimple on her left side near the corner of her mouth. She has full but not overly plush lips which tend to be left their natural color of only a few shades darker than her skin. She has a slender frame, small waist and narrow hips with a shapely backside and moderate bust. Often wearing whatever designer clothing she feels like with her custom designer high heeled boots. Often her wardrobe can be considered inconvenient for the messes she can find herself getting into. %0a%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25color=#C54FDC%25'''Hooks'''%0a%0a!!!!%25color=#C54FDC%25 ''New York (Fellow New Yorkers)'': %0aShe's from Manhattan and only recently arrived (middle of August) to Miami.%0a%0a!!!!%25color=#C54FDC%25 ''Crime Family?

Her dark brown hair with golden highlights descends to her mid-back, matching her manicured dark brows. A regular forest of dark brown freckles dusts her nose and cheekbones generously, with a gentle dimple on her left side near the corner of her mouth. She has full but not overly plush lips which tend to be left their natural color of only a few shades darker than her skin. She has a slender frame, small waist and narrow hips with a shapely backside and moderate bust. Often wearing whatever she feels like and sometimes inconvenient for the messes she can find herself getting into. %0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c (:div2end:)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Contacts'''%0a%3c %0a%3c ||! %25mortal%25Image ||! %25mortal%25Name ||! %25mortal%25Relationship ||! %25mortal%25Comment ||! %25mortal%25Ringtone ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c %0a%3c (:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Hooks'''%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25mortal%25 ''New York (Fellow New Yorkers)'': %0a%3c She's from Manhattan and only recently arrived (middle of August) to Miami.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25mortal%25 ''Crime Family?
