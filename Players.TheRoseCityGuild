This was accomplished through the Guild’s goal of Identification- they brought with them an entire binder full of names, pseudonyms, and photos of almost every single member of the newly formed Embassy. Knowledge, not petty supernatural tricks, was the power that carried the day for them.%0a%0aSince the war, the guild has only grown and been split into chapters formed around various professions with the over goal of protecting mortals and the covert goal of continuing Identify and preferably gain leverage over other supernaturals. Each chapter actively recruits mortals, psychics, and other minor talents that don’t fall under the other factions’ aegis.%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''%25color=#008080%25Doctrine''' \\%0a%0a%25center%25'''Detect. Identify. Protect.'''%0a%0aThis is the Rose City Guild’s mission. Though the organization has its roots in the founding of Portland, the modern incarnation of the Guild came about during the War of the Four when professionals and businessmen came together with strategies to keep their communities safe from the supernatural menace. Through the 70s the Guild became more open to ‘Parapsychology’- psychic powers - and successfully recruited some of these people to help them protect humanity. When the war finally ended in 1980 The Rose City Guild was well established, well financed, and dedicated to keeping the city safe from the supernatural monsters of the city. They had also proven that the greatest powers one can have is organization, motivation, and knowledge.%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25'''%25color=#008080%25Self Improvement Mentor Program''' \\%0a%0aThe [[Self Improvement Mentor Program]]('''SIM Program'''), Run by [[Siobhan Prince]], [[Frank Martin]], and [[Ebony Marshall]], is to help members of the Rose City Guild learn how to better control their powers and develop new powers. It will be only open to Rose City Guild members. The goal is to find the right Mentor to match the Mentee’s request. Members wishing to be Mentors will need to have a personality profile done to make sure they have the right social skills and mental temperament to be Mentors. %0a%0a%0a*Making a list of all RCG member’s and their powers.%0a*Making sure it is kept safe and updated with new members and as members powers grow and expand.%0a*Each member will have a file which lists their powers, their skills, and personality profile.%0a*This way when selecting a mentor, there is less of a risk of personality conflicts.%0a*Interview Mentors, and Mentees before, during and after.%0a*To make sure the mentee is getting the proper amount of lessons so that they will learn.%0a%0aThe goal of the SIM Program is to make sure all the members who wish to fine-tune their control on their current powers or learn new powers know where to go and how to get the help they need. We will be keeping tabs on every mentor and mentee pair to make sure that they learn what they ask for. So that no one slips through the cracks.%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''%25color=#008080%25Ties to the setting''' \\%0a%0aLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Knowledge, not petty supernatural tricks, was the power that carried the day for them.%0a%3c %0a%3c Since the war, the guild has only grown and been split into chapters formed around various professions with the over goal of protecting mortals and the covert goal of continuing Identify and preferably gain leverage over other supernaturals.

Though the organization has its roots in the founding of Portland, the modern incarnation of the Guild came about during the War of the Four when professionals and businessmen came together with strategies to keep their communities safe from the supernatural menace. Through the 70s the Guild became more open to ‘Parapsychology’- psychic powers - and successfully recruited some of these people to help them protect humanity. When the war finally ended in 1980 The Rose City Guild was well established, well financed, and dedicated to keeping the city safe from the supernatural monsters of the city. They had also proven that the greatest powers one can have is organization, motivation, and knowledge.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''%25color=#008080%25Ties to the setting''' \\%0a%3c %0a%3c Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
