However, we don’t want to entirely prevent ‘on the fly’ magic or Creative Thaumaturgy, so we’re implementing the following rules:%0a%0aCreative Thaumaturgy may be performed in staff-run scenes ‘on the fly’, at the staff member’s discretion. Being allowed to perform a spell in a staff-run scene without it being finalized (see below), however, does NOT guarantee that it can be used again, as the mechanics will generally be simplified and made to suit the current situation.%0aCreative Thaumaturgy spells may be submitted to the “Rules Master” group via a “Custom Item/Power” request, where it will be discussed and balanced as needed. There’s no specific time limit between submissions, but please only submit CT for spells you’re capable of casting and actively plan to use.%0a%0aOnce approved, Creative Thaumaturgy spells will be made publicly available on the wiki, and can be cast and used by anyone as if they came from an official source.%0a%0aIf no staff is present, you may only perform approved and published spells in scenes.%0a%0aNote that for now, only spells can be submitted, not custom Reach effects for published spells, to avoid difficulties cross-referencing.%0a%0a!!Exceptional Successes on Casting%0a%0aThe listed option of ignoring all Withstand ratings on an exceptional success in spellcasting is not available.%0a%0a!!Pattern Restoration%0a%0aPattern Restoration is not able to remove Conditions or Tilts that are supernatural in nature; they need to be removed with appropriate spells (or resolved normally). It can remove mundane conditions/tilts that are applied because of supernatural powers, however (but if the power’s still active, this may be a Clash of Wills or it may just be re-applied).%0a%0a!!Sleepwalkers%0a%0aTO clarify, Sleepwalkers are not mechanically considered a “half-template” for the Mage venue regardless of how involved in the Mage venue the Sleepwalker may be. Instead, Sleepwalker is a classification for characters who are immune to the Curse, cause no Dissonance, do not increase Paradox and remember what they’ve seen (as pertains to the Supernal). Additionally, characters who fall under this classification can purchase Sleepwalker Merits (defined as those with “Prerequisite: Sleepwalker”, NOT “Prerequisite: Mortal”, or “Prerequisite: Integrity”).%0a%0aCharacter types who are considered Sleepwalkers (Note: Only 1 of the following is necessary):%0a*Mortals who have purchased the Sleepwalker merit%0a*Mortals who have purchased an “internal” Supernatural merit (Chronicles of Darkness)%0a*Changelings, Vampires, Werewolves, Fae-touched, Ghouls, Wolf-blooded or any other supernatural template.%0a*Ephemeral beings and similar ‘Non-Template’ entities, like Strix and Oneroi, do not count as Sleepwalkers for the purpose of related mechanics, but nor do they count as Sleepers for the sake of paradox.%0a%0a!!Unsafe Relinquishment%0a%0aRelinquishing a spell unsafely (with a willpower point) is an act of hubris at the Understanding level without an immediate need to. An inured spell is of course not affected by this.%0a%0a!!Clarification: Boons%0a%0aFate spells that grant a boon cannot provide a Potency dice bonus to casting dice pools, even if the spell lists affecting spellcasting pools as its own Reach option. Dice Tricks (e.g 9-again) affect spellcasting normally if Reach is used.%0a%0a!!Clarification: Combined Spells%0a%0aCombined spells have the same factors (if their Primary differs, choose one), including specified targets/area, unless a Reach is spent to separate the Scale.%0a%0a!!Clarification: Nimbus Tilt%0a%0aNimbus Tilts only affect those actively witnessing them, meaning those using Mage Sight (or other supernatural powers that can perceive it), or anyone when the Nimbus is deliberately flared; this also includes the offender when the Nimbus is used defensively. However, the mage flaring the Nimbus is not affected by their own Tilt in any case.%0a%0a!!Clarification: Resistance and Withstanding%0a%0aMerits and abilities that subtract from a type of power’s resisted dice pool instead raises Withstand by 1/2 the amount (round up) when dealing with spells.%0a%0aMerits and abilities that specifically treat the trait as higher just do exactly that.%0a%0a!!Clarification: Shielding Spells%0a%0aAs listed in the Creative Thaumaturgy rules, Shielding spells will only protect against a number of supernatural effects equal to the spell’s potency for a given casting.%0a%0a!!Policy: Staff and Paradox%0a%0aReleasing Paradox always requires a staff member present to direct the paradox Reach; it’s recommended not to release paradox for downtime casting%0a%0aInternal Paradoxes require a staff member to be notified if more than 5 successes are rolled beyond what’s absorbed by Wisdom, as a new Paradox condition is likely to be needed.%0a%0a%0a%0a!!Cabal Creation%0a%0aTo create a create a request ticket or include in sanctioning request the following completed template%0a%0aTemplate Example%0a%0a:Name: Cabal Name%0a%0aMembers:%0a* -Shadow Name 1 - First Last Name%0a* -Shadow Name 2 - First Last Name%0a* -Shadow Name 3 - First Last Name%0a%0a:Theme: Theme that binds the cabal%0a%0aRites & Tenants - As per Lex Magica%0a*Rite of Acceptance%0a*Rite of Wisdom%0a*Rite of Crossing%0a*Rite of Hospitality%0a*Rite of Sanctum%0a*The Tenet of the Veil%0a*The Tenet of Hubris%0a*The Tenet of Protection%0a*The Tenet of War%0a%0aLocations%0a*Neighborhood: Location%0a*Safe Place: Location%0a*Sanctum: Location%0a*Hallow - Yes/No%0a*Demense - Yes/No%0a%0aShared Dots%0a* -Shadow Name1- First Last Name 2 Dots Safe Space, 1 Dot Sanctum, 1 Dot Hallow%0a* -Shadow Name2- First Last Name 1 Dots Safe Space, 1 Dot Sanctum, 1 Dot Hallow%0a* -Shadow Name3- First Last Name 1 Dots Safe Space, 1 Dot Sanctum, 1 Dot Hallow%0a* -Shadow Name4- First Last Name 0%0a%0a:Description: Details about the cabals goals.%0a%0a%0a!!Consilium Status%0a%0a*Status 1%0a%0aAny mage that resides in the city of Portland that has declared themself to a member of the Consilium’s Leadership Ally - Any exemplary resident of the Consilium’s domain who has served the Consilium.%0a%0a*Status 2%0a%0aLiegeman/Liegewoman - Any mage who represents a cabal to the Consilium or who has earned special recognition for services to the Consilium.%0a%0a*Status 3- Mages at rank 3+ May be appointed the following position of service:%0a%0aSentinel - The Enforcer of the Consilium’s Law, tasked with patrolling its Sanctum and its Borders.%0a%0aHerald - The Voice of the Consilium, tasked with acting as emissary amongst the Wise and distributing the edicts of the Consilium and its Leadership.%0a%0aFactotum - The Prosecutor of the Consilium’s Law and the Lex Magica, tasked with prosecuting those members of the Wise who break the Lex as it has been established.

A primary order must be declared. Players can still earn ICly ranks 3–5 in their primary status.%0a%0aStatus 3+ and their associated titles can only be earned through IC dedication to an Order or the Consilium and are granted by the Story Master/Narrator Staff at no XP cost. These ranks and titles can be stripped from a player for poor game play practices, inactivity, or failure to participate.%0a%0aOrder Status Benefits%0a*Once during a month the Mage may request 1 dot from the temporary bonus list from their order.%0a*Once during a month the Mage may request 2 dot from the temporary bonus list from their order.%0a*Once during a month the Mage may request 3 dot from the temporary bonus list from their order.

Sleepwalkers are required to prove that even though they are not mages they will and have adapted the Adamant Way. Once they have proven themselves to the Adamantine Arrow they will receive a special pin, this pin identifies the individual as someone whom has provided honorable service. The pin also grants supervised access to Arrow Hall Conference Room within the Embassy Hotel. %0aEmblem of the Banner Warden%0a%0a%0aPlayers with knowledge of the supernatural and support of the Embassy accords may take Status 0 in the Adaminte Arrow. Taking Status 0 offers no benefit or obligation in continued support the Mage Faction. After completing a story arch that includes Investigation and Combat alongside an Adamantite Arrow players may purchase status 1 with Narrator or Story Master approval. Status 1 requires the individual has sworn an oath to defend the city and must answer a call to arms if made by the Adamantine Arrow.%0aMages%0aStatus 1 - Talon%0aA mage who has been received into the Arrows may take the title Talon. It is considered an honor to be accepted into the ranks of the Adamantine Arrow. Mages from any other order can earn the first rank, Talon, without conflict with their primary order. Mages are expected to present themselves as competent, respectful, and diligent while in the service as an Arrow. Failure to do so has rather undesirable results. %0aGaining status 0 in the Adamantine Arrows is rather easy. Loyal,extended service in the defense of the city is the bare minimum for this rank. Gaining Status 1 from outside the Adamantine Arrow is a lengthy and challenging process. The mage must prove they are capable of maintaining the balance between their order and the Tenants of the Adamantine Arrow. Out of Order mages that gain status 1 in the Adamantine Arrow are granted supervised access to Diamond Securities above ground facilities and underground Labs.%0aStatus 2 - First Talon%0aFamuli (singular famulus) of the Adamantine Arrow form the backbone of the order. Rising higher in Status than First Talon requires a great deal of dedication to or ambition for the order itself, and Arrows have other concerns splitting their attention — Sleeper relations, protecting the Consilium, their cabals, their pupils, their mentors and so on. An Arrow might comfortably remain within his duties as a First Talon his entire Awakened life, and suffer no stigma from his order because of it.%0aMages from any Order can earn the rank of Talon. But they can not exceed rank 3 in their primary order should they chose to dedicate themselves more intensively to the Arrows.%0aStatus 3 - First Talon%0aPosition of Service: A member of the Adamantine Arrow who has earned the rank of first Talon. Dedicated themselves to the order, projecting themselves as the and takes a position of service like Herald or Sentinel.%0aStatus 4 - Thunderbolt Guardian%0aPreparation is the key to victory, so the order enshrines this principle in the rank of Thunderbolt Guardian. Thunderbolt Guardians are teachers and counselors, versed in several useful fields, and also personally apply their abilities to operations.%0aStatus 5 - Adamant Sage (PC)%0aThe Adamant Sage is by far the hardest rank to achieve and maintain. The Adamantine Sage is a shining example, a paragon, of all things Adamantine Arrow.%0a[&#8593; back to top]%0a%0a[[#FreeCounciltitles]]%0a!!!Free council \\%0aStatus Titles%0aStatus 0 - Unproven%0aThe mage has not be accepted as a full member of the Free Council but has expressed interest. They may attend assembly meetings but can not vote.%0aStatus 1 - Voter%0aAny mage who has been accepted fully into the Free Council. This mage may vote at Assembly meetings.%0aStatus 2 - Voter%0aMages that reach the rank of two may start down the path to a Title of Service among the Free Council.%0aStatus 3 - Voter with Title of Order Service%0aThe magi who reaches status 3 has proven they are competent in their service. They are awarded their title of service at rank 3.%0aStatus 4 - 5 Voter - Trusted with greater responsibility%0aFree Council mages that competently and consistently serve the Assembly will be entrusted in greater duties among their field of service.%0aTitles of Service%0aEmissary%0aA position of ambassadorship, emissaries are the means by which the local Assembly interacts with other magi, other supernatural groups, and/or the embassy. Low-ranking emissaries are usually emissaries to their cabals, while higher-ranked ones may be asked to act as the Assembly’s ambassador to a Caucus or Consilium.%0aMinuteman%0aThe citizen-soldiers of the Free Council, minutemen are those who have proven themselves defenders of the Council’s goals and members. They are expected to respond immediately to summons by the Council’s members, and to fight valiantly, whether in physical and magical conflict, or in the social arena. Additionally those who seek to gain status with the Adamantine Arrow must inform a ranking member of the Assembly.%0aSyndic%0aPoliticians, the ideal of the Syndic is the Greek debater - clear-eyed, making people understand the nuances of the problems a people face, and then offering wise and charismatic ways to solve those problems.%0aCitizen Agent%0aSpies, covert agents and special forces, the citizen agents of the Council are regarded with great respect as heroes. They give of themselves constantly, often sacrificing their every-day lives for the good of the Council. These agents have neither subordinates or masters, instead taking on the missions requested of them by Assembly or Strategos.%0a[&#8593; back to top]%0a%0a[[#GuardiansoftheVeiltitles]]%0a!!!Guardians of the Veil \\%0ahide%0aStatus Titles%0aStatus 0%0aCultor that has not completed their Crimson Veil. A Cultor is the lowest members in the order they are not privy to any special information about the workings of the GoV. Their job is to take and weave the lies for the masses. Completion of the Crimson Veil grants the next rank of status.%0aStatus 1 Neophyte%0aThe rank of Neophyte denotes a mage that completed their Crimson Veil and are considered a full member of the GoV.%0aStatus 2 Famulus%0aA famulus is a mage that completed their final veil. They are a firm believer in the beliefs of the GoV. This is the most common rank for members of the GoV. Some mages may never exceed the rank of Famulus because they failed some aspect of their veils. But instead of being informed they become trapped at this level. If the mage has not failed their Veil a higher ranking member may seek them out or vice versa to begin their next level of training.%0aStatus 3 - 4 title of Service%0aMages that reach these ranks have completed their veils, trained in a position of service and completed their training. Additionally they have proven their loyalty to the GoV in some profound act.Those mages that find themselves at this rank will begin a new understanding of the innermost working of the Guardians, their ultimate goals and beliefs.%0aStatus 5 Epopt or Magister%0a(At least 1 Arcana Mastered to be called a Magister) %0aEpopt perform two functions. They manage the Labyrinth, upholding the order’s network of influence and misdirection, and they recruit new members, sending them through the Veils. An epopt rarely works alone. She directs other Guardians to support conspiracies and initiate novices through the Veils. Epopts are always experienced Guardians, but they rarely rise to the highest ranks of the order. The Guardians of the Veil value the Labyrinth, but try to keep its games at a distance.%0a%0aTitles of Service%0aCulto%0aCultors create and oversee the maintenance of Labyrinths. Though they are not responsible for the ways in which the caucus will use the Labyrinths, they are responsible for seeing that the Epopt’s decisions are made manifest in the Labyrinths.%0aEmissary%0aAs many caucuses avoid revealing the identity of their Epopt - or sometimes, even the identities of their membership at all - the emissary acts as the public face of the Guardians to the local Consilium and other orders. Emissaries attend to public and private meetings, even being the one to deliver threats.%0aSusceptor%0aThe elite spies of the Order, Susceptors are the field agents of the Guardians, their identities usually known only to Epopts. They eschew long-term strategies in favor of immediate objectives and tending to goals personally.%0a[&#8593; back to top]%0a%0a[[#Mysteriumtitles]]%0a!!! Mysterium \\%0ahide%0aStatus Titles%0aStatus 0%0aExemplum: New initiated members who have yet to learn anything about the Atlantean Mystery. These members are not allowed to enter the athenaeum unescorted.%0aStatus 1 - Neokoros%0aMembers who have mastered the Mystery of the Principle. A neokoros may explore the Athenaeum in the shallows depths of the great library.%0aStatus 2 - Neokoros Superior%0aA Mysterium mage who has spent time studying the Mysteries, mastered the Mystery of the Principle, and guides other Neokoros on their own study of the Mystery of the Principle.%0aStatus 3 - Daduchos%0aA mage who has mastered the Mystery of Nightmares. Daduchos is the first level that allows the mage to take a position of service.%0aStatus 4 - Daduchos Superior%0aMuch like the Neokoros superior the Daduchos superior has studied, mastered, and is now guiding other magi along the Mystery of Nightmare. These mages have also taken a position within the order and proven themselves able to lead.%0aStatus 5 - Hierophant%0aHierophant must prove mastery of all of the great mysteries.%0aTitles of Service%0aAcquisitor%0aField agents that travel the world to unearth Supernal knowledge%0aCensor%0aSafekeepers of artifacts who protect them from abuse by unenlightened hands%0aTheoricus%0aMembers who have mastered the Mystery of the Soul%0aSavant%0aMages who train in a certain field (one supernatural, one worldly) to preserve its knowledge for the Mysterium, in case that an Athenaeum%0athat confined this knowledge is destroyed%0a%0aCurator%0aKeeper and custodian of an Athenaeum%0aPhilosophus%0aMembers who have mastered the Mystery of Misfortune%0a[&#8593; back to top]%0a%0a[[#SilverLaddertitles]]%0a!!!

Famuli is the minimum rank within the Silver Ladder needed to become a Factotum.%0aFactotum- are the lawyers of the Lex Magica. Mages of other Orders may call themselves factotum, but only among the Silver Ladder is it a rigorously-defined position of honor.%0a%0aStatus 4%0aClaviger are responsible for maintaining the Silver Ladder’s ideological purity and recruit other mages for the Order.%0aStatus 5%0aDeacon is all things to all théarchs: leader, lawgiver, priest and chief representative.%0a[&#8593; back to top]%0a%0a[[#CustomItemsandPowers]]%0aMage%0a[[#Deathct]]%0a!!!!Death Spells \\%0aLife Conversions%0aThe following Life spells can be assumed to have Death-based equivalents at the same level that affect Vampires (and other non-ephemeral, physical undead):%0a%0aMutable Mask (Life 2)%0aDegrading the Form (Life 3) (Note: This specific mirror works even on living targets)%0aHoning the Form (Life 3)%0aKnit (Life 3)%0aMany Faces (Life 3)%0aTransform Life (Life 3) requires both Death 3 and Life 3%0aAnimal Minion (Life 4)%0aMend (Life 4)%0aRegeneration (Life 4)%0aShapechanging (Life 4) requires both Death 4 and Life 4%0aSpirit Conversions%0aThe following Spirit spells can be assumed to have Death-based equivalents at the same level that affect Ghosts and similar Death-related ephemeral entities instead of Spirits:%0a%0aInvoke Bane (Spirit 1)%0aKnow Spirit (Spirit 1)%0aCommand Spirit (Spirit 2)%0aShadow Walk (Spirit 2)%0aCraft Fetish (Spirit 4)%0aShape Spirit (Spirit 4)%0aAnnihilate Spirit (Spirit 5)%0aShadow Sight (Death •)%0aPractice: Unveiling%0aPrimary Factor: Duration%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Investigation, Occult, Survival%0aFor the duration of the spell, the Mage is capable of seeing the true form of shadows, seeing their boundaries, size, shape, and everything else about them. This essentially allows the Mage to see in any amount of darkness, though if no light at all is available, he’ll only see in varying shades of textureless blackness. By default this spell only reveals mundane darkness to the user’s senses.%0a+1 Reach: The sense extends to the supernatural; anything supernaturally concealed that’s covered with shadows or darkness can still be perceived by the Mage if he wins the ensuing Clash of Wills. This will also outline ‘sentient’ creatures of darkness as separate from other shadows, including mages using Shadow Flesh, or creatures from various shadowy realms….%0a%0aInvite the Grave (Death •••)%0aPractice: Perfecting%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aWithstand: Stamina%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Medicine, Science, Intimidation%0aThis spell enhances the course of Entropy, making those that suffer from it feel the effects that much more intensely. The next time the subject suffers at least a point of damage over the Duration, increase the damage suffered by this spell’s Potency; the damage is the same type as that originally suffered. This can affect a maximum number of damaging effects equal to the spell’s Potency.%0a%0aNights Grasp (Death •••)%0aPractice: Weaving%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aCost: 1 Mana%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Occult, Academics, Science%0aNight’s Grasp enables the caster to form starry black tendrils from the very shadows themselves. These tendrils can strike, grapple, hinder, and restrict under the command of their creator acting as the mages inpromtu defender until the spell is dropped. %0aOne tendril is created per target factor; these tendrils have a brawl dice pool equal to the spell’s Potency, no defense, and health equal to the caster’s Death rating. The tendrils act on the Mage’s initiative, but being mindless, do not perform acts on their own; one tendril per turn may be given a simple command (attack X, defend Y) reflexively by the caster, or an instant action may be used to give them all the same command. They will continue to attempt the action until it can’t be done anymore or a new command is given (or the spell ends, of course).%0a+1 Reach: The caster’s Brawl rating is added to the tendrils’ dice pool.%0a+1 Reach: The tendrils can affect Death-aspected Twilight.%0a%0aOpen Avernian Gateway (Death •••)%0aPractice: Weaving%0aPrimary Factor: Duration%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Intimidation, Occult %0aThis spell targets an Avernian Gateway, opening it for the duration and allowing anyone (from either side) to travel through it until it closes again; this applies the Underworld Gate condition to the area. Any attempt to close the gateway before the spell ends provokes a Clash of Wills.%0a+2 Reach: The Gateway only opens in one direction, allowing the Mage to travel through it into the Underworld without allowing ghosts out, for instance.%0a%0aSuppress Decay (Death •••)%0aPractice: Fraying%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Medicine, Athletics, Survival%0aThe mage is capable of stifling entropic energy, causing wounds and other injuries to be rendered superficial and harmless. For the duration, 2 points of pre-existing bashing damage per point of Potency can be ignored by the subject, as if they were undamaged. The underlying wound will heal at about twice the normal speed during this time, as well, since the body needn’t deal with the actual ‘harm’ itself. If the duration ends before the wound heals, the damage for any unhealed wounds reappears (accounting for the increased healing speed).%0aThis will also prevent bleeding out and other injuries that worsen over time for the duration.%0a+1 Reach: The spell can suppress one pre-existing lethal damage per Potency instead of 2 bashing.%0a+1 Reach: The mage may suppress a pre-existing Personal Tilt caused by Damage, such as Arm Wrack, causing the damage to become entirely superficial (if disturbing).%0a+2 Reach: The effect is Lasting (but the superficial wounds still take time to heal)%0aAdvanced Shadow Crafting (Death ••••)%0aPractice: Unraveling%0aPrimary Factor: Duration%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Academics, Intimidation, Occult%0aWhile a weaker version of this spell exists that crafts items from shadows and solidifies them for use by the mage, this more potent spell creates weapons and items that inflict weakness on opponents using the disabling nature of the Underworld towards the living. Indeed, these are not merely shadows, the shadows used in this spell are forged from death and have a devastating affect of living flesh, and their potent shadow-forged weapons strike not only the flesh of corpses and dead creatures, but affect their very being. The maximum durability, damage rating, and equipment bonus from objects crafted from shadow increases to match the rating in the casters Death Arcana. Additionally, attacks from these weapons deal lethal damage, even to Undead and Ephemeral beings (related to the Death aspect of Twilight) that normally downgrade such damage.%0a+1 Reach: The shadows are potent manifestations of the decay of death, and successful attacks inflict the Sick (Grave) tilt while in combat on living targets.%0a+2 Reach and 1 Mana: The weapon does Aggravated damage as it not only attacks the body, rotting away flesh and decaying bone, but it damages the very essence of the creature as well. This deals aggravated damage against creatures that normally downgrade most forms of damage, including Vampires and ephemeral beings. While this reach is in effect, any weapon forged by the shadows is considered a 0A weapon.%0a%0aDead Man's Mask (Death 3)%0a'''Practice:''' ( Weaving )\\%0a'''Primary Factor:''' (Duration)\\%0a'''Withstand:''' (Equal to appropriate powerstat- Automatically Reflexive)\\%0a'''Cost:''' ()\\%0a'''Suggested Rote Skills:''' ( Athletics, Medicine, Survival)\\   %0aThis spell was designed to Mask undead minions from the Gaze of sleepers, though equally useful if cast upon more intelligent undead  like vampires, mummies and the like.  It makes the target dead or undead creature act as if its body was still alive.  It does not however remove any weaknesses of the body, such as sunlight vulnerability Etc. The more powerful the dead creature is, the harder it is to give it the trappings of life, it therefore has a reflexive Withstand even if the undead in question wishes to be subjected to the effect. The withstand equals the blood potency, rank, or what ever equivilent powerstat the undead possesses.  A basic corpse has zero powerstat, as well as those animated by other uses of the death arcana. The spell will only give the trappings of being alive. The subject will breath, have warm skin, a pulse, and be able to emulate the other basic functions of life, such as eating and drinking food. Corpses will not stink, bloat or otherwise decompose, and appear to be asleep. The subject will register as alive to most mundane senses and objects, and use of supernatural powers to determine the status will cause a Clash of Wills.  It will NOT prevent any of the other normal functions, requirements, or weaknesses of the subject. A vampire may eat, but gains no sustenance from the food, and does not heal like a living person. They are still vulnerable to sunlight, and require vitae to function. Conversely, they do not NEED to breath, eat, etc., still being immune to suffocation, starvation (from deprivation from normal food or drink), and still retain their resistance to injury and other factors.%0a%0aForbid Injury (Death ••••)%0aPractice: Unraveling%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Medicine, Athletics, Survival%0aAn Adept of Death is capable of not only stifling injury, but making even the most egregious wounds incapable of actually harming one’s life force, stripping away the actual danger present in any form of injury. Each level of potency causes 2 pre-existing lethal damage (i.e that were there upon casting) to be ignored by the subject, as if not present at all, although the superficial wounds remain, and become dangerous again after the duration ends. However, the underlying injury heals at twice the speed for the duration, as there’s no true harm for the body to struggle against. %0aThis will also prevent bleeding out and other injuries that worsen over time for the duration.%0a+1 Reach: The spell can suppress pre-existing aggravated damage. Cost: 1 mana%0a+1 Reach: The subject may dedicate a Potency to ignore a single pre-existing physical tilt for the duration, rendering any injury or impedance entirely superficial, barring actual removal of an appendage or other body part.%0a+2 Reach: The effect is Lasting (but the superficial wounds still take time to heal).%0a[[#Fatect]]%0a!!!!Fate Spells \\%0aBetween the Lines (Fate •/Prime •)%0aPractice: Knowing%0aPrimary Factor: Duration%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Academics, Occult, Expression%0aThis spell reveals key information about the form and intent of symbols, whether these are cultural (e.g. art, status items), lingual (e.g. hobo-signs, alien glyphs), or magical (wards, curses, etc.) As examples, the subject may interpret a painting as reflective of melancholy over social issues, a ring or scar as denoting accomplishment or status in a public or secret society, a series of hobo-signs marking a dangerous passage, or arcane symbols as denoting intent to warn, curse, harm, disease, seal, or summon.%0aThe spell offers no information about the creator, the symbol’s origins, or the symbol/item’s veracity (e.g. if a piece is fake or truly gilded). Furthermore, the spell offers no information about follow-through: threatening symbols are no guarantee of violence, nor is a sealing symbol proof of supernatural power and/or its success — only its intent to seal. The spell reveals, exclusively, information about the intent of the symbol itself.%0a+1 Reach: Short visions inform the Mage about the symbol’s origins, adding Potency to rolls involving the interpretation or study of symbols.%0a+2 Reach: Spend a point of Mana. The Mage can cast this spell as a Reflexive action.%0a%0aCounting the Magic Beans (Fate •)%0aPractice: Knowing%0aPrimary Factor: Duration%0aWithstand: None%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Empathy, Streetwise, Survival%0aBy tapping into the web of narrative-as-Destiny told by the Hedge, the mage becomes keenly aware of the characters and plants native to the Hedge nearby. She feels the gravity of their narrative as it tries to draw the Mage in to their tropes. Most mages specify certain types of characters to detect, such as “Hobs and Goblin Fruit,” or “only Huntsmen.”%0aAfter successfully casting this spell, the mage can detect all the specified types of characters within the spell’s area Scale, or that enter the spell’s area while it remains in effect. The Mage also knows what the characters are under the Mask, if applicable. The Hedge’s thorns are uniquely immune to being processed by this spell.%0aAdd Mind 1: The mage can detect the presence of Oneiroi, Baubles, Cobblethought, and Dreamspun items.%0aReach +1: The Mage can detect things transformed by the Hedge, such as Hedgebeasts and Changelings.%0aReach +1: The Mage can specify characters by their role or function so long as it has been made an intrinsic part of their nature, allowing the Mage to specifically look for “Goblin Merchants” or “Poisonous Goblin Fruit.” When combined with the above Reach, the Mage can look for Changelings with specific Kiths (but not Seemings, as the Hedge is not responsible for that transformation).%0aFind the Path (Fate •)%0aPractice: Knowing%0aPrimary Factor: Duration%0aWithstand: None%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Academics, Occult, Survival%0aThis spell can detects the presence and location of Irises leading to or from the Hedge in the area of effect of the spell’s Scale. Add this spell’s Potency to rolls made by the subject to navigate to it.%0aReach +1: The subject becomes aware of one type of topographical feature within the Hedge in addition to any Iris’s, such as (but not limited to) Trods and Hollows. By adding Mind 1, this may include Dream Bastions. This Reach may be selected multiple times.%0aSupernal Targeting (Fate •, Time •, Space •)%0aPractice: Knowing%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Firearms, Athletics, Investigation%0aA mixture of knowing how the next fleeting moments will affect a subjects target’s position, intimacy with the correlation between objects spacially, and a preternatural sense of timing are molded together to allow a mage to begin preparing his actions for efficiency, well before conventional precepts with eerie fluidity. This spell makes aiming a thrown or fired weapon take less time. In lieu of spending a turn aiming, the aim action’s use-time is reduced to an Instant Action. In most cases, this allows a Mage to aim and move. Also, as long as the Mage does not change the target(s) of this accuracy, attacks do not reset the bonus received from aiming. If the target of the aim action moves outside of the Mage’s line of sight, the aim is disrupted normally. Sleeper Witnesses suffer Quiescence normally.%0a+1 Reach: The spells affected aim actions are made reflexively, though this does not allow for multiple aim actions to be taken in one turn.%0a%0aSummoning (Fate ••)%0aPractice: Ruling%0aPrimary Factor: Duration%0aWithstand: Resolve%0aCost: None%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Investigation, Expression and Persuasion%0aFated things and people are pulled together as if by gravity and with this spell the mage compells that law of Fate summoning to her side lost things and people.%0aThe mage cast this spell on her target then at anytime during it’s duration she may sense how to reach her target. She doesn’t know the whole route to take just what steps to take to find them but she does have a general sense in what direction her target lies. She may invoke this ability a number of times equal to the spells Potency.%0aIf the Object or Person is within the immediate area the target becomes apparent in someway to the caster, perhaps a soft wind blows making it rattle or a streetlight turns on highlighting it. If the optional Reach effect is taken instead the person or object makes it’s way back to the mage. Typically this takes up to 24 hours if the target is in the same city but could take longer for longer distances.%0aPeople that are being summoned have the impression their being called by the caster and have a rough idea how to find the caster but nothing concrete. Events will conspire to lead and harass the target to come to the caster of this spell. If they actively resist this spell’s call they suffer a Hex equal to this spell’s potency so long as they continue to ignore the calling (in such a case, they find it difficult to stay away, but not impossible).%0a+2 Reach: The target makes its way back to the caster, as described.%0a+3 Reach: As above but the target hurries back in half the normal time (if not resisting the call).%0a%0aFreedom (Fate •••)%0aPractice: Perfecting%0aPrimary Factor: Duration%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Larceny, Survival%0aUsing this spell, the mage’s potential is safeguarded against the mundane meddling of those seeking to control her using a more mundane methodology. Hands slip free, keys are dropped and bounce just barely into reach, the cuffs failed to lock tight enough, or the chair the mage is tied to finally decides to break after it’s years of service are through, leaving the subject surrounded with a means to cut her loosened bonds. Efforts to grapple the subject of the spell are reduced to a chance die, regardless of how easily achieved the grapple was established, though the subject suffers similar effects regarding her ability to ensnare subjects as well. Mundane binding of any form, on their own, fail automatically, and Supernatural effects that employ physical means of trapping the subject provoke a Clash of Wills (up to Potency times). This spell fails if the subject is unconscious or otherwise unable to take action%0a+1 Reach: The effect only works one way, the subject(s) of the magic being able to bind and tie their own targets are unrestricted by the magic, but the target’s own rolls are not penalized to resist these attempts (such as when doing any maneuver other than Breaking Free in a grapple).%0aAdd Time 4: One such escape attempt’s affected dice roll each turn during the spells Duration can be made as a reflexive action, as the mage applies this strain of defiance over time in the blink of an eye.%0a%0aMake It Look Easy (Fate •••)%0aPractice: Ruling%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aWithstand: Composure%0aThe subjects exceptional success threshold for mundane rolls are expanded or reduced by the spell’s Potency during the spell’s Duration (to a minimum of 1), up to a number of times equal to Potency. This spell has no control over whether or not success is actually achieved, what it does is increase or decrease the forceful effects of success, so that even meager efforts can make for a higher grade of results, or mighty efforts met with modest effects. This spell can make capable experts appear to be talented charlatans, or make up amateur taxi drivers to seem like trained Hollywood stunt devils.%0a+2 Reach: The spell affects spell-casting rolls and supernatural powers, but may not reduce the threshold below 3, no matter the potency.%0a%0aUnlocking the Secret Garden (Fate •••)%0aPractice: Weaving%0aPrimary Factor: Duration%0aWithstand: None%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Crafts, Larceny, Survival%0aThis spell allows the Mage to force an Iris leading into or out of the Hedge open or closed, regardless of its associated keys. This may require a Clash of Wills in the case of Gateways being kept open or closed by another being.%0aReach +1: The Mage may instead change one detail of the Gate’s Key or means of access per Potency. A gate that opens to red headed stepchildren that spin around backwards three times might be changed to opening for anyone, that claps their hands three times for two Potency.%0aBaleful Blade (Fate 4)%0aPractice: Patterning%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Weaponry, Firearms, Athletics%0aSometimes the knife needs a little push to find its mark, to hit those soft points and nerves, to punch between the ribs. A bat needs the oh-so slightest perfection in the swing to knock a collar bone in half, and a bullet needs that extra centimeter to the left to pierce the heart. With this spell an acanthus can urge the strings of fate to tug it in the right direction, making even the smallest pen knife an instrument of doom for its victim. The target of this spell has its weapon rating increased by +1 per potency.%0a+1 reach: The weapon also gains Armor Piercing equal to the spell’s potency.%0a%0aCharmed Life (Fate ••••)%0aPractice: Patterning%0aPrimary Factor: Duration %0a‘Withstand: Composure if resisted%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Occult, Socialize or Persuasion%0aThe subject of the spells enjoys or endures a life of extremes. A blessed life does away with minor inconvienances such as too many red lights or stubbed toes. They can also be blessed in the following ways to a maximum number of times equal to the spell’s potency. Each use is reflexive and can only be used once per turn, and not th esame turn as the same condition was expended or resolved.%0a%0aGain the Charmed Condition%0aGain the Steadfast Condition%0aGain the Resolute Condition%0aDowngrade the level of damage by one category against one attack (Can’t downgrade Aggravated damage unless Reach was spent for this effect)%0aMeanwhile a cursed subject suffers indignities at every turn, spilled coffee to running late to work. For each potency of the spell the subject suffers one of the following effects whenever it’s dramatically appropriate as determined by the Storyteller. As a charmed individual above an effect from this spell can only occur once per turn and is reflexive.%0a%0aAn exceptional success becomes a normal success%0aA failure becomes a dramatic failure%0aDamage from an attack is upgraded one level (Can’t be upgraded to Aggravated damage unless Reach was spent for this effect)%0aApply a negative condition or Tilt appropriate to the situation%0a+1 Reach: The spell can downgrade or upgrade damage from/to Aggravated%0a%0aWhat If Scenario (Fate ••••/Time •)%0aPractice: Patterning %0aPrimary Factor: Duration%0aSuggested Rote Skills: (Occult; Science, academics)%0aThe mage can look into a subject’s possible future and see what could be if certain strings of fate were manipulated. This allows the mage to divine where altering the fabric of fate may affect the future, or potentially seeing what the outcome of a particular destiny may be. Without reach, the mage can only dvine the effects of their own fate and changes they might make. This spell can see far into the future, allowing the mage to see most likely long-term consequences of their current fate. The mage may incorporate as many possible shifts to their fate as potency. Looking too far from the present increases the likelihood of the answer being superseded by the point the future becomes the present. The Storyteller must decide what the future holds, taking into account the nature of the story as well as cues from the mage’s description of the “what if scenario.”%0aWhile viewing the possible future, the mage loses all Defense and may not take any actions or cast further spells. %0a+1 Reach: The mage can specify fates external to their own in the What If Scenario.%0a+1 Reach: The mage can specify a specific date and time in the future to perceive the results of the What If scenario at that time.%0a[[#Forcesct]]%0a!!!!Forces Spells \\%0aMatter Conversions%0aThe following spells from Matter can be used with equivalent Forces on/relating to electronic/computerized devices.%0a%0aMachine Invisibility%0aDiscovery Protocol (Forces •)%0aPractice: Knowing%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Computer, Intimidate, Larceny%0aModern technology still requires a known piece of information to ask a question of a machine. The awakened Discovery Protocol circumvents this necessity of known information to extract information that is available for request by the nature of the system. This spell extracts a hybrid DHCP-ARP cache from an active system. A table of this type acts as a symbolic sympathetic yantra to each device on it, and Representational to the device from which it was extracted.%0a+1 Reach: Rather than a copy of existing data, the device produces a brand new, specialized table, increasing the primary device’s sympathetic strength from the table to material (though this fades to representational after a month, as normal).%0a+1 Reach: By providing the faintest spark of power, an unpowered device becomes a valid target.%0aAdd Spirit 1: A spiritual resident or representation of a system becomes a valid target, providing its sympathetic name as well. A spirit may withstand with its Rank.%0a%0aMagnetometer (Forces •)%0aPractice: Unveiling%0aPrimary Factor: Duration%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Science, Academics, Subterfuge%0aThe subject is able to sense metal and magnetic materials, including the size and location of the object; similar to a magnetometer at security checkpoints, but with more precision.%0a+1 Reach: The target knows the shape of the object or objects detected.%0a%0aProgrammer’s eye (Forces •)%0aPractice: Knowing%0aPrimary Factor: Duration%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Computer, Investigation, Science%0aUnder the programmer’s eye, all code remains mysterious until it unfolds, sloppy notations, personal quirks run rampant through the system. However, by undergoing a moment of epiphany under this effect, the subject gains a complete understanding of the software or the data. It’s intended purpose is obvious and available; as is its absence. Corruption, Encryption, and Mistakes that interferes with normal operations are also revealed, but not immediately understood and must be corrected through other means.%0a+1 Reach: Understanding the function of the examined code grants the subject 8-again on all actions using the studied code. Only the most recently studied object gains this benefit as the supernal clarity fades from the mind’s eye to replace it with another.%0a+2 Reach: As above, plus the spell reveals all potential uses of an object, fanned out in a vast array of Supernal symbols around the object. Focusing on a particular use might require a reflexive Wits + Composure roll for especially complex items.%0aAdd Fate •: The mage names a particular task when casting the spell (e.g. “get leverage on Carruthers,” “translate the Codex Afire”). Any data that might help with that task seem to loom larger, to be more digitally present, and are immediately obvious to the subject as soon as she lays eyes on them.%0a%0aRun Software (Forces •)%0aPractice: Compelling%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Computer, Drive, Expression%0aComputers have only begun to scratch the surface of their potential and as man reaches their imagination extends towards a new step that could not have been considered before that moment. Running a program within a computer system is among the simplest of digital magics available to those who delve into this type of magic. The affected program simply responds as the mage wishes. Any action requiring a skill roll treats the spell’s Potency as its successes.%0a+1 Reach: Scripts can be set for automation, performing their task when some value is met, however it must be within the confines of what a computer understands. This is most often its time clock.%0a+1 Reach: The caster can perform more complex tasks while controlling the object, including extended actions or maintaining continuous control of the object as long as the spell’s Duration lasts.%0a%0aAethernet (Forces ••, Space ••)%0aPractice: Ruling%0aPrimary Factor: Duration%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Computer, Larceny, Persuasion%0aFree WiFi is never truly free. It comes with its own risks and rewards and it is still, even today, not quite ubiquitous. Opening an ‘Aethernet’ connection allows a device which generates a signal (cellphone antenna, wifi adapter, RJ-45) to broadcast to a device which generates a similar signal (cell tower, wifi enabled router, ethernet cable) and receive those signals remotely using the natural sympathy of their wavelengths which is hardcoded to reality and the natural propensity for devices of these types to communicate.%0aAdd Death ••, Sprit ••, etc: By adding •• in an Arcanum whose purview includes another realm of existence (e.g. the Underworld or the Shadow), the mage may transmit data from that realm into the physical world, or vice versa.%0aAdd Time ••: By asserting that today is still yesterday, the character may access information that existed prior to entering an other worldly realm. This is most useful for accessing (deleted) digital libraries and not so much for email or news feeds.%0a%0aInhibit Ignition (Forces ••)%0aPractice: Ruling%0aPrimary Factor: Duration%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Crafts, Science, Occult%0aWith this effect, the mage inhibits fire’s ability to spread to or to ignite new substances within it’s area of effect. While it will not extinguish existing flames, such a fire will die out naturally when its existing fuel is expended and it is unable to spread. %0aMore importantly, however, no new sources of ignition will work within the area. Matches or lighters will not light, nor will fuses. Explosives or their primers will not ignite, preventing bombs or grenades from exploding, and even bullets will not fire (note though, that projectiles NOT propelled by explosives will still work, for example Airsoft or CO2 guns). Vehicles operated by internal combustion engines will not run (but electric vehicles will!). %0aIf the source of fire or combustion is magical or supernatural in nature, this will provoke a Clash of Wills. %0a%0aMerciful Blow (Forces ••)%0aPractice: Ruling%0aPrimary Factor: Duration%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Brawl, Science%0aUseful for both training purposes and for those who wish to subdue an opponent without causing permanent damage, the mage diffuses the force of his armed or hand to hand strikes, changing any lethal damage caused, into bashing. As usual, excessive bashing damage may roll over into lethal. This spell has no effect on INCOMING blows, only ones made by the mage himself.%0a+1 Reach: The spell applies the Knocked Down Tilt%0a+1 Reach: The spell applies the Stunned Tilt%0a+2 Reach: The spell may be applied to thrown weapons. Alternately, it may be applied to Firearms, however they also automatically lose any Armor Piercing rating.%0aOverclock (Forces ••)%0aPractice: Ruling%0aPrimary Factor: Duration%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Computer, Persuasion, Science%0aAmplify the power, refine the language, complete the circuit; through subtle changes in the system, the target electronic device becomes increasingly receptive to the user’s input. The grants its user the 9-Again quality for the duration of the spell, so long as it’s a tool that can benefit from an increase in processing power.%0a+1 Reach: The tool grants the 8-Again quality instead.%0a%0aReroute (Forces ••)%0aPractice: Ruling%0aPrimary Factor: Duration%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Computer, Larceny, Subterfuge%0aData flows constantly, and with the correct nudge it can be made to flow to places other than its originally intended destination, as the case may be, packets will universally be resent to fill the void that was left when the receiving end fails to find the correct piece. A bank account number, the latest torrent streams, it all becomes accessible while in motion. Texts and emails are especially of great value as the cases may be. Only a single type of data may be affected.%0aAlternatively, the mage can repel certain forms of data from a subject in a similar fashion; not getting that call, that text, that email can greatly disrupt normal business operations.%0a+1 Reach: Additional types of data may be compelled to or from a subject, per level of reach.%0a%0aFlash Freeze (Forces •••)%0aPractice: Fraying%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Intimidation, Occult, Survival%0aThe mage frays the heat of a subject, suddenly and dramatically dropping its temperature as though exposed to a snowy winter night. The effects of this vary by subject and circumstance. For example, most liquids and vapours condense/freeze, and most solid substances become brittle (ignore 1 Durability while frozen). If used on a living being, the spell causes Bashing damage equal to Potency for those incapable; if the spell is cast with sufficient Duration on a being capable of hibernation, it may be induced with this spell instead of damage.%0aNote that this spell may cause further effects based on the being frozen, or being subjected to local temperature differences when the spell ends: sudden freezing may cause containers to burst, heated ice may crack, and condensed/frozen vapors may evaporate in high concentrations.%0a+1 Reach: The sudden chill is enough to cause Bashing damage to all subjects. Those already susceptible to Bashing damage from the spell suffer a penalty to their Athletics equal to the spell’s Potency.%0a%0aIn for a Shock (Forces 3, Life 3)%0aPractice: Fraying%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Medicine, Science, Brawl%0aWith a touch, the Mage can harness and amplify the natural electrical impulses to create an electric shock within the subject. The subject takes the spell’s Potency in bashing damage as nerves misfire and electrical impulses are interrupted.%0a+1 Reach: The sudden jolt causes the Stunned tilt due to its intensity.%0a+1 Reach: Electrical devices in the target (Such as pacemakers) or touching the target’s skin also take the damage, bypassing Durability.%0a%0aRecompile Software (Forces •••)%0aPractice: Weaving%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Computer, Drive, Streetwise%0aFrom 01000001 to 01011010, the digital sea ebbs and flows with software as it runs and performs its operations. Grasping deep within this network fueled by the genius of Tesla and Edison, born of Babbage and Turing, the mage may grasp and seize the children of Lovelace, forming them into new shapes to suit an immediate need. The Imago takes this need and realigns the 1s and 0s until they form the function that is required in that instant. What is a program: The chatbot, the firewall, the personal assistant. The MMO, the conversation, the Dialogue, the circle spins endless and takes limitless shapes. Humanity has yet to find the limit of what its software is capable of becoming. %0aThe potency of this effect reshapes the software, acting as successes to skill rolls performed by the software, if applicable. Each piece of software can only serve a single function, whether it be searching the internet, driving a car, or targetting an orbital strike.%0aTo code the software to the appropriate form, the mage must have an understanding of the code to be created, requiring a successful Intelligence + Computer check, penalized by the complexity of the new software. The ‘new’ software must still be operated by the user, which can be intensely frustrating when it no longer serves its original purpose.%0a+1 Reach: Scripts can be set for automation, performing their task when some value is met, however it must be within the confines of what a computer understands. This is most often its time clock.%0a+1 Reach: The caster can perform more complex tasks while controlling the object, including extended actions or maintaining continuous control of the object as long as the spell’s Duration lasts.%0a%0aHeat Shield (Forces •••)%0aPractice: Weaving%0aPrimary factor: Duration%0aSuggested rote skills: Athletics, Occult, Science%0aThe mage redirects electrons, letting heat and electricity pass harmlessly around her. This spell acts as a shield against direct damage from fire and electricity, granting effective armour equal to the caster’s Forces Arcanum. It cannot stack with other sources of magical shields or armour. Mage Armour explicitly suppresses this spell when active, even if the protection should be less than the effect it replaces. Magical sources of harm trigger a Clash of Wills, and the spell can Clash as many times as the spell’s Potency. %0a+1 Reach: Instead of the energy being harmlessly scattered, any damage prevented by the spell can be redirected to adjacent targets. Any targets within two meters not protected by this spell, including any attackers and the mage’s surroundings, suffer half the absorbed damage as bashing damage.%0a%0aRoll With It (Forces •••)%0aPractice: Perfecting%0aPrimary Factor: Duration%0aCost: 1 Mana%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Science, Brawl%0aThe subject gains a superlative understanding of the application of kinetic force and leverage. The subject knows how to move to dissipate and redirect the energy from physical blows to reduce damage - possibly even avoiding what would otherwise be a solid strike, potentially setting up a counter-attack. This spell grants the subject’s attempt to dodge physical attacks, including attempts to grapple, the rote quality. The subject’s player can choose which of his rolls are affected (declared before the dice are rolled). This is used a number of rolls equal to potency while the spell duration is active. The subject of the spell is still subject to other dodge restrictions. %0a+1 Reach: This spell applies to attempts to escape a grapple.%0a+1 Reach, Add Time 1: The character may attempt to dodge bullets and similar attacks.%0a%0aSound of Creation (Forces •••)%0aPractices: Perfecting%0aPrimary factor: Potency%0aCost: 1 mana%0aSuggested rote skills: Expression, Occult, Science%0aAny action that has sound quality as a key component (i.e. musical performances) is heightened to magical perfection and acquires the rote quality. The subject gains the quality for a number of appropriate mundane rolls equal to Potency. While Forces are not commonly thought of as the source of inspiration, sonic energy holds mystical sway over living beings, and a master of this spell can use it to draw the perfected power of the Aether and use it to fuel and enhance her own gifts to exploit its many secrets.%0a%0aCompile Sprite (Forces ••••)%0aPractice: Patterning%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aWithstand: Composure or Rank%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Computer, Expression, Occult%0aSingularity. The Ghost in the Machine. SkyNet. Titan and Promethean. Replicants. Artificial Intelligence. We are software operating in the medium of a machine sculpted from a billion years of evolution and we now seek to create that which is ourselves within the digital medium, cause and effect, a summation of experiences, the methods go on for shaping these nascent disembodied beings though we inevitably seek to embody them that they might live among us in our world. Each level of Potency effectively grants a dot of the Retainer merit. The Sprite’s “Field” is defined at the time of its compilation, and must make sense for an AI in the system it’s implanted.%0aAdd Death ••••, Mind ••••, or Spirit ••••: Binds a ghost, goetia, or spirit into the Sprite, which allows it to act as a vessel for that entity. The sprite still uses the Retainer dots to determine dice pools, but it can use any of the possessing entity’s powers, and the sprite’s “field” is whatever the entity is capable of.%0aAdd Mind ••••: Binding a mind into the Sprite allows it to act a vessel for that consciousness. The sprite uses the dice pools of the mind’s owner in performing its tasks. While its mind is absent, the body remains unconscious and must be sustained through other means. If the body expires, the mind remains within the sprite until the end of its duration as normal and then passes to whatever fate it would normally achieve.%0a%0aMagnetic Freak (Forces 4)%0aPractice: Patterning%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Science, Firearms By rewriting how magnetic objects react to the electromagnetic fields around them, the Mage becomes able to warp and control magnetic materials. This works with normal Scale factors , which define the number and size of the ferrous objects that can be manipulated. These targeted objects can be warped, moved through the air, mechanically reshaped, or otherwise manipulated in any manner appropriate to the strength of the electrical field; for the purposes of any related dice pools (such as attacks, jury-rigging, tearing apart an object, etc), use the spell’s Potency.%0a%0aPiercing Cold (Forces ••••)%0aPractice: Unraveling%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Intimidation, Occult, Survival%0aThis unraveling of the subject’s heat is an attack spell, inflicting lethal damage equal to its Potency. Against objects, ignore 2 points of Durability unless specifically built for such rapid temperature change. Appropriate liquids and vapours up to the affected Size/Scale are immediately frozen, often with catastrophic effects when subjected to the immediate heat around them. If cast with sufficient Scale, affected subjects already within appropriate liquids (e.g. arm in a full sink, swimming in a pool) may suffer appropriate Tilts, such as Pinned or Immobilized.%0a+1 Reach: Ice thickens over one of the subject’s appendages, freezing it to a nearby surface and causing the Pinned Tilt (HL 143).%0a+2 Reach: The cold creates an entrapping layer of ice over the subject, causing the Immobilized Tilt with Durability equal to half the caster’s Forces rating (rounded up).%0a+1 Reach: For one point of Mana, the spell inflicts aggravated damage.%0a[[#Lifect]]%0a!!!!Life Spells \\%0aThe Body Never Lies (Life •)%0aPractice: Knowing/Unveiling%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Animal Ken, Empathy, Subterfuge%0aThe human body communicates much more than words say. Gestures, natural expressions, unconscious verbal cues, muscle ticks, heartbeat, perspiration, pheromones.%0aPotency is applied as bonus toward Empathy primarily Animal ken and Subterfuge to understand emotional states, lies, and basic intents, though physiological cues and anticipate active primal social instincts, as well as to detect mixed hidden truths.%0a+1 Reach:’ Apply 9-again toward applicable understanding dice pools rolls only.%0aLesser Life Support (Life ••)%0aPractice: Shielding%0aCost: 1 Mana%0aPrimary Factor: Duration%0aThis spell is used to keep bodily fluids, individual organs, and substances made up of ‘living’ cells alive beyond normal expectancy outside of a body. For the duration the subject (which must be simple organisms, individual organs, bodily fluids of a more complex organism, or similar substances) are kept alive instead of degrading, from lack of nutrition, needed oxygen, carbon dioxide levels, and other storage factors, allowing cells to reconstitute themselves for the duration of the spell.

The Life practitioner exploits this fact, activataing glandular responses and neural impulses to force a subject to take a particular action; what Control Instincts suggests, this spell demands.%0aThe action must be able to be encapsulated in a single word, though actually speaking it is not necessary - flee, attack, sleep, sneeze. The action must also be driven by instinct and biology; the Mage could force a subject to scream but not to speak.%0aThe subject is compelled to carry out the action for the duration of the spell - in the case of sleep, the subject wakes naturally (i.e. if he is disturbed or their sleep otherwise disrupted). If the action becomes impossible to continue, though, the spell ends early (For instance, making someone vomit ends once their stomach contents are expelled). %0aBy default, this spell works only on mundane, living creatures. ‘Psychics’ and minor/half templates count as sufficiently mundane for this.%0a+1 Reach: This spells affects living supernatural creatures normally. This cannot directly provoke a state like Death Rage, however.%0a[[#Matterct]]%0a!!!! Matter Spells \\%0aX-Ray Vision (Matter ••)%0aPractice: Veiling%0aPrimary Factor: Duration%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Crafts, Investigation, Science%0aThe subject of this spell is able to look through non-living objects as if they were not there. This does not extend the subject’s senses further than normal or give the subject the ability to see in darkness (without other magial means) but instead see as if non-living objects were not in there.%0aFor example the subject could look through a wall and see people in the next room, but could not see said people if there was no lights in the next room or if there were several living trees in the way.%0aThis allows the subject to cast sensory-range spells on targets the subject might not ordinary be able to perceive.%0a+1 Reach: The subject can look partway through an object.For example: to see the face of a playing card by looking through the back of the card, or to look part way through a safe to see the tumblers, or to see that someone baked a file/bomb into a cake.%0aAdd Life 2: The subject can also see through living things.%0aAdd Forces 1: The subject can also see through forces which may block sight.%0a%0aElixer/Charm (Matter •••/Prime ••)%0aPractice: Weaving%0aPrimary Factor: Duration%0aCost: 1 Mana%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Science, Occult, Crafts%0aUse of this spell allows the caster to temporarily place another spell that he can cast into a physical medium he crafts for later use. This medium can be a potion, unguent, powder, or any small object of size 1 or less, like a small stone or piece of jewelry. The caster must cast this spell to prepare the form, immediately followed by whatever spell he wishes to store, defining all spell factors and Reaches, paying any additional costs of the stored spell, and rolling for the spell, and Paradox if necessary, as normal. Attainments can not be stored this way. If the casting of the stored spell fails, the physical form of the Elixer/Charm is destroyed and the caster must start again. If successful, the spell does not take place at this time though, being stored in the physical medium. Any spell which is intended to affect a target other than the user of the medium is automatically a touch spell, or must be used as an Aimed Spell, the physical medium thrown, squirted or sprayed at the target with a Dex+Athletics roll, who gets their defense and may attempt to Dodge. If the stored spell has an area effect, it may be targetted at a location and effect anything within its range. The caster must define the method of use of the medium at the time of casting, if it is swallowed, rubbed or sprayed on, thrown at a target,crushed underfoot, etc. Regardless of the method, it requires an instant action, and the medium is destroyed in the process. Anyone who performs the activation, even accidentally, will trigger the stored spell. If the duration of the Elixer/Charm spell ends before the stored spell is triggered, the stored spell is lost without effect, but the medium is still destroyed. Both the Elixir spell and any stored spells count towards spell control normally, but may be Combined using the normal systems. %0aIn order to use this spell, the mage must incorporate a Sacrament Yantra into the casting, which counts against the normal Yantra limit. This becomes the physical form of the Elixer or Charm. This Sacrament must have an availability rating equal to or higher than the level of the spell the mage wishes to store in the item (if he wants to store a Forces 2 spell, the Sacrament must be Availability 2+). The mage may acquire this material at the normal Availability, or make it himself with the Build Mystic Equipment action (Wits+Occult), using the availability as the penalty to the roll. If that roll is successful, the total cost of components is reduced by 2, to a minimum of 0. (The mage wants a potion capable of storing a Life 3 effect. If he wants to acquire the needed item normally, it will have an Availability of 3. If he wants to make the potion from scratch, it would require a roll of Wits+Occult-3,and if successful, components with Availability 1). In addition, the Potency of the stored spell can’t exceed the the Potency of the Elixer/Charm spell itself (if the Elixer/Charm is cast with Potency 2, the maximum Potency of any spell stored in it is also 2).%0a%0aExtraction (Matter •••)%0aPractice: Weaving%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aWithstand: Durability%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Crafts, Medicine, Science%0aThe mage can separate any non-living material from another, causing it to sublimate, evaporate, or film as it separates.%0aThis does not breakdown existing chemical compounds, but may separate free ions in a substrate such as NA from NaCl dissolved within water, but won’t actively break molecules without additional application of other separate factors such as solvent, electricity, electromagnetic energy, enzymes, acids, bases or heat. This spell alone does not cause a physical barrier, and in liquids or gasses, will recombine as a normal reaction at end of duration. Removal of liquids from solids will pool on the surface and is easier to clean off until duration expires.%0aWith some substances, recombination may be more dangerous than direct spell use itself if not safely handled.%0a+1 Reach: This spell may be able to cause speed reductions or possibly immobility upon complex devices if chemical power storage or lubricants are compromised.%0aAdd Life •••: The spell can affect living subjects to extract non supernatural poisons from a living bloodstream, so that it can be collected cohesively rather than just randomly purged from the system, or have to pass specifically though the kidneys. This could be popular with awakened smokers with tar lung, or removing poisoning that continues to harm after regular healing. This is withstood with Stamina if unwilling.%0a[[#Mindct]]%0a!!!!Mind Spells \\%0aSpirit Conversions%0aThe following Spirit spells can be assumed to have Mind-based equivalents at the same level that affect Goetia and similar Mind-related ephemeral entities instead of Spirits:%0a%0aInvoke Bane (Spirit 1)%0aKnow Spirit (Spirit 1)%0aCommand Spirit (Spirit 2)%0aShadow Walk (Spirit 2)%0aBolster Spirit (Spirit 3)%0aAnnihilate Spirit (Spirit 5)%0aState of Mind (Mind ••)%0aPractice: Ruling%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aWithstand: Composure (only if resisted)%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Persuasion, Expression, Subterfuge%0aThe mage alters the subject’s basic mental flow, changing his subconscious and conscious thoughts and emotions to reflect any mental or emotional state the mage wishes.%0aFor each level of potency target receives one non-Persistent, mundane Condition. Said Conditions must be one created from the emotional/mental/perceptional state of the target(s), so Conditions such as Notoriety or Connected are not applicable, but conditions such as Deprived, Swooning, Spooked, Steadfast, Guilty, Leveraged, etc. are possible (these are just examples, not a complete list of possible Conditions). These Conditions can be positive or negative (or both).%0aIf the target resolves all the Condition before the Duration expires, the spell ends early.%0a+2 Reach: The Conditions created can affect spell casting rolls.%0aDevil’s Charm (Mind •••)%0aPractice: Perfecting%0aPrimary factor: Potency%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Persuasion, Subterfuge, Socialize%0aMaybe it’s the way he smiles, or the slight tilt in her hips as she walks.

The extra slot is filled by one personality trait of the caster’s choosing, but the caster’s core personality (their original Virtue/Vice) cannot change. Willpower still may only be gained normally (Vice - once per scene, Virtue - twice per month), but their influence in Social Maneuvering count individually. This means it is possible for a tempting offer that satisfies both Vices makes it easier to manipulate a Mage under the Vice-Ridden merit’s effect, moving them two steps up the Social Maneuvering Impression chart OR an offer that acts in opposition to both Virtues adds two Doors to Social Maneuvering for a mage under the effects of the Virtuous merit.%0a+2 Reach: The caster may benefit from BOTH the Virtuous and the Vice-Ridden merits. The second merit gains an additional trait that is defined at casting. (Default one extra in each)%0a+1 Reach: For every level of Potency, the caster can add one Virtue/Vice (as appropriate) to a pool of traits to choose from. Each of these traits must be defined at spell-casting (and specified as a Virtue or a Vice if using the +2 Reach above). To switch from one trait to another requires a simple meditation roll (COMP+RES) taking several minutes of focused concentration. Again, core personality traits cannot be affected.%0a+2 Reach: As above, however it takes one turn of focused concentration, rather than a meditation roll to switch personality traits.%0aI’m Rubber, You’re Glue (Mind •••)%0aPractice: Weaving%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Empathy, Intimidation, Politics%0aBased on a principle similar to the old children’s rhyme “I’m Rubber, You’re Glue, Whatever you say bounces off me and sticks to you”, this spell allows the subject to “bounce” back any attempts to Socially Maneuver him, with the result “sticking” to the person making the attempt. During the duration of the spell, the subject may reverse the effects of any Social Maneuvers or merits which would open Doors, up to a number of Doors equal to the potency of the spell, with the same “Goal” effects. %0aThe character attempting to open the subject’s doors declares their goal, methods, and makes any rolls as normal, but any doors that would be opened affect the character making the attempt rather than subject. The attacker’s Doors are determined as normal based on the Goal, their own Virtues, Vices, Aspirations, etc. The big bully trying to intimidate the subject suddenly realizes that the skinny guy actually is scary as hell, or the Femme Fatale attempting to seduce him discovers that she really IS “that into him”. %0aIf the Social Maneuver or merit is either supernatural in nature, or being bolstered supernaturally, this will provoke a Clash of Wills. %0a+2 Reach: By spending 1 mana, the spell may be cast reflexively in response to a Social Maneuver or merit. %0a+1 Reach: One ADDITIONAL Door is automatically opened.

The recipient regains the lost Willpower dot, and the donor loses a dot.

By twisting the flow, the power flows not outwards but inwards, empowering or debilitating the mage as they themselves empower or debilitate the world and those around them; mechanically, the subject, who must be a mage, becomes affected by their own Nimbus Tilt. %0aThe seal placed upon the mage remains in place for the duration but the effects of the nimbus remains only for the duration it would normally last, thus a spell causing the nimbus to flare will cause the effect to impact the caster for a number of rounds equal to the potency of the effect.%0a+2 Reach: The Nimbus remains in effect for the full remaining duration of the spell after it is triggered.%0a%0aBlaze of Glory (Prime •••)%0aPractice: Perfecting%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aWithstand: Composure%0aCost: 1 Mana%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Politics, Persuasion, Intimidation%0aThis spell allows a mage to channel mana in order to enhance a supernal nimbus. For the Duration of the effect, the subjects’s Immediate Nimbus is treated as if his Gnosis has increased by the Potency of the spell. This only intensifies existing tilts (positives become more positive, negatives become more negative). If the subjects’s Immediate Nimbus normally causes multiple tilts (for example &#8722;1 Resolve, +1 Presence) the caster may choose how the additional effects are applied within the current tilts. In addition, the subject’s Immediate Nimbus is considered to be flaring for the duration of the spell, as if done purposely, and so is visible even to mundane perception. All normal effects and drawbacks of this still apply. This effect only affects subjects with a naturally occurring supernal nimbus.%0a+2 Reach: The mage may apply a new tilt, or multiple new tilts, up to the total of that granted by the increased effective Gnosis. However, the subjects normal tilts still are in effect, and may conflict with or counteract applied ones. (IE, if the subject has a &#8722;1 Resolve tilt normally, and a +2 Resolve tilt is applies with this effect, it would have the total effect of having a +1 Resolve tilt.)%0a%0aCommunion (Prime •••)%0aPractice: Weaving%0aPrimary Factor: Duration%0aWithstand: Resolve%0aCost: 1+ Mana%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Computer, Occult, Socialize%0aThe greatest works of the Wise require every possible advantage in their creation and so with this magic an apprentice may assist their master with greater works rather than being a hindrance to the process. Those mages under the effects of the Communion, up to the spell’s potency, roll their Gnosis as a pool with each success reducing the penalties to the primary caster’s spell roll. This dice pool may not be modified by Willpower, magic, or other means. This burns a single mana from each participant. %0a+2 Reach: The assisting mages may add their own Arcana to their Gnosis pool.%0a%0aConsume Passion (Prime •••/Fate ••)%0aPractice: Perfecting%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Empathy, Expression, Occult%0aThis spell taps into the idyllic properties of a sufficiently ecstatic experience, absorbing a single point of Mana into the subject.%0a%0aThese ecstatic expressions must be intense, emotionally charged, and mind-altering. Even raucous parties are not enough: only an expression iconic and powerful enough to shake the Fallen world, even for a moment, may be tapped into. Deep religious rituals, strong drug/insanity trips, live sacrifice, glossalalia, suspension, mutilation, witnessing a failed Breaking Point, and other experiences that produce an altered or disassociative mental state might apply. On the supernatural side, states of uncontrolled passion (Kuruth, frenzy, etc) can be used if the caster is daring enough to risk their time and presence. Emotionally intense supernatural acts (not casual/quick exchanges) ending with supernatural energies may also apply. For example, watching a hunt for fresh prey’s blood, glamour, or other energies that culminates in a dramatic feeding. Formal Oblations and other acts that already generate Mana may not apply, nor do states directly caused (not merely catalyzed) by magic: the energies and connections those actions tap into are already being used.%0a%0aA subject may not gain more total Mana from this spell in a day than the latest caster’s dots in Prime, and any Mana infused into a subject that cannot contain it naturally dissipates at the end of the spell’s Duration.%0a%0aCreate Tass (Prime •••)%0aPractice: Weaving%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aCost: 1+ Mana%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Crafts, Occult, Expression%0aThe mage may channel Mana into a physical form, creating a piece of tass that represents an idealized Supernal form. The object created must be a simple object or tool no greater than Size 5 (food, swords, and gemstones are allowable, while guns and cars are not), and is obviously magical. The tass may appear menacing or intricate, but cannot perform tasks significantly; even high Durability item are too brittle to really cut or drive screws, for example. Any usage as a tool is considered to be improvised, and each action doing so expends 1 Mana from the tass. In addition, the tass has no explicit energy, nor it is subject to normal laws regarding its form. For example, tass food does not spoil, but neither does it nourish the eater, and the mage is advised not to increase the Durability of food beyond 1 if they expect it to be eaten.%0aThe tass has a default Durability of 1 and consists of one point of Mana (which the mage must pay as part of the casting). Potency may be allocated to increasing the Durability or Mana capacity on a one-for-one basis. When all Mana is withdrawn from the tass, it crumbles to nothing. A mage may “refill” the tass with the Channel Mana spell or similar effects. When the spell’s Duration runs out, any unused Mana sublimates back into the world and is lost.%0aAdd Forces 3: The object is not obviously magical.%0aAdd Life 2: Tass created as food/water is nourishing at the cost of expending 1 Mana.%0a+2 Reach: The effect is Lasting (though the tass still crumbles if all its Mana is expended or absorbed.)%0a%0aFocused Aetheric Winds (Prime •••)%0aPractice: Weaving%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Expression, Occult%0aThe Mage calls forth a bare fraction of the howling fury of the Aether, blasting their subject with supernal winds. This is an attack spell, inflicting bashing damage equal to Potency.%0a+1 Reach: The winds of the spell are focused on a particular point, inflicting the Arm Wrack or Leg Wrack tilt.%0a+1 Reach: In lieu of damage, the mage may assign Potency to instead destroy the target’s Mana. One level of Potency so designed destroys one point of Mana, and Potency mzu be freely split between Mana destruction and damage.%0a%0aForge Glamour (Prime •••)%0aPractice: Perfecting%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aCost: 1+ Mana%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Larceny, Persuasion, Socialize%0aAs the Realm of Platonic Exemplars, the Supernal Realm of the Aether provides the essential nature of the worlds, this is seen most obviously in the constructs sculpted from raw mana which is the Thaumaturges right. More complicated are the esoteric ideas, the roles assumed by the Thespians, but these truths are no less than the Perfect Sword or the Perfect Hammer. Weaving a pattern of mana about their person, the Thespian draws down a piece of this perfected concept, assuming the role as it exists in its perfected state. This glamour suffuses them with props which serve their role and only their role, but these things remain insubstantial mere concepts to satisfy a need to present the correct postures. Potency may be allocated tot he following effects:%0a%0aA dice bonus akin to striking looks while engaging in the role portrayed.%0aIncrease Mana capacity by +1 (the mage may fill this Mana capacity by spending Mana as part of the casting or%0aleave the object partially empty)%0a%0a+1 Reach: The Illusion of the Glamour may improve a Persona Yantra, splitting its potency towards perfecting it to a maximum of +4.%0a+1 Reach: The Truth of the Illusion may be flared, burning a point of mana from its pattern to grant an 8-again to the dice roll.%0aAdd Forces 3: The illusion is not obviously magical.%0a%0aNot on My Watch (Prime •••)%0aPractice: Weaving%0aPrimary Factor: Duration%0aCost: 1 Mana%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Occult, Athletics, Persuasion%0aFor the duration of this spell, the Mage becomes better able to Counter certain spells, not just causing them to fizzle but launching them back at their caster. When targeted by a single-target, hostile spell, the Mage may use the Counterspell attainment with the requisite Arcana (NOT Universal Counterspell) to cause the spell to be reflected upon the caster instead of simply fizzling. The spell takes effect as if the original caster were the target, with other spell effects working normally. The spell may be dismissed normally still, but any lasting effects remain.%0a+2 Reach: The caster may invoke this as a Reflexive Action for an additional Mana, allowing them to cast it while Counterspelling.%0a%0aRaising the Pillars (Prime •••)%0aPractice: Perfecting%0aPrimary Factor: Duration%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Crafts, Persuasion, Science%0a”And the Druids turned to stone…” Libertines have a great affinity for the magic of humanity allowing them to use its practices to exemplify their own supernal magic through the presence of even sleepers. This spell allows a mage to reinforce the Supernal Truth of an Environmental Yantra composed of Sleepwalkers or a Techne Instrument composed of Sleepers increasing their collective bonus to the Potency of the spell, this remains limited by the normal rule that no Yantra may exceed a +5 bonus.

She creates from Tass (see Platonic Form) the perfect tool for a specific spell. For each potency she achieves on Eidolon the tool provides a +1 Yantra bonus (remember a single Yantra can’t grant more than a +5 bonus) for a specific spell (which can be a Rote, Praxis or a regular spell) or increase it’s Mana capacity by 1. The spell must be from one of the mages ruling Arcana. As Platonic Form spell the Tass holds by default 1 Mana and 1 mana is drained from the Yantra each time it is used. The tool created by this spell is a simple representation of size 1 or 2 max and has 1 Durability.%0aA Yantra can be made for another mage to use but it still follows all the same rules (ie: the yantra can only effect spells from the creator’s Ruling Arcana.)%0aNote: Spell stacking rules apply; only the highest Potency Supernal Eidolon can be used for a given spell as a Yantra. +1 Reach: The tool is the perfect Yantra for all spells of a specific ruling Arcana the mage possesses%0a+1 Reach: The tool encompasses an additional Ruling Arcana the mage possesses%0a%0aWitchlight (Prime •••)%0aPractice: Weaving%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Expression, Occult, Science%0aThe mage manifests a mote of the Aether’s raw revelatory energies, making light that is visible only to Active Mage Sight. It often appears as an orb of fire or electricity, but may look like anything unliving between the size of a walnut and a torch. Witchlights have substance, but are of negligible weight, able to be scooped up by hand. It provides no heat or force, and does not evoke special responses by appearance (e.g. frenzy or bans from fire); however, the appearance may still be shocking, or provoke responses related to light if it can be perceived. It may be held, positioned on a subject, or launched as an aimed spell like a flare. If a target wishes to resist a witchlight’s attachment to their Pattern, use Composure as a Withstand to make it simply slide off and continue with its natural momentum.%0aA witchlight illuminates 10 yards per point of Potency clearly enough to make rolls without penalties for darkness, and twice that range at half the darkness penalty (rounded down). The light may be willfully dimmed, enhanced, or strobed to inflict the Poor Lighting Condition within its range of clear illumination.%0a+1 Reach: Increase the witchlight to the size of a bonfire, doubling its range of illumination.%0a+1 Reach: The light may be made visible to all supernatural entities, or even revealed fully into the Fallen world.%0a+2 Reach and 1 Mana: The witchlight is Lasting, but cannot be fixed to a living target, burst, or change its level of illumination.%0a%0a!!!!Break the Defiant (Prime •••)%0a'''Practice:''' Perfecting\\%0a'''Primary Factor:''' Potency\\%0a'''Withstand:''' Resolve\\%0a'''Suggested Rote Skills:''' Politics, Athletics, Intimidate\\%0a%0aTruth is not kind.

The mage casts the spell and ties it to the target’s pattern. The spell is only half formed allowing for some flexibility to the recipient to use.%0aThe target may cast the spell at anytime the caster could and makes all the decisions for the spell. The target can spend reach and uses the dice pool of the caster. However any mana that the spell needs or might use must be spent when Imbue With Power is cast unless the target has their own Mana to spend (The mage may place Mana with the Imbued With Power spell). It should be noted that the recipient cannot use Yantra’s with this spell or benefit from Ritual casting (although they still can to avoid spending Reach to make the spell Instant.)%0aImbue With Power has a drawback. Paradox is suffered by both the caster and target of the mage of any spell unleashed by Imbued With Power. While Paradox can be dealt with normally if the recipient is a Sleepwalker without Wisdom they cannot internalize it.%0aThe gifted spell can be used a number of times equal to this spell’s potency. The target of this spell cannot gain more potency of their gifted spell than Imbue With Power’s potency.%0a+X Reach and 1 Mana - When casting Imbued With Power the mage may also include an Attainment that can be included with the spell. X is equal to the Attainment’s required Arcana level. This may only be an attainment that enhances or alters the spell directly; Temporal Sympathy could be added, for instance, but not Mage Armor.%0a%0aLamina (Prime ••••)%0aPractice: Patterning%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aWithstand: Stamina%0aCost: 1 Mana per subject%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Expression, Crafts, Occult%0aThe mage exudes and crystallizes a pelt of mana over the subject’s flesh, fusing a protective layer of tass to the mana that constitutes the subject’s pattern. Each level of Potency may be directed to 1 point of general or ballistic armor. Naturally, the subject glows like a lamp to anyone capable of sensing mana, and is unlikely to be able to explain their appearance to Sleepers.%0a+1 Reach: Mana may be invested into the lamina to make it immune to the Armor Piercing effect for a turn. This may be invested during casting and held until use, or spent directly by the subject. Unused Mana is not destroyed when the spell ends, but sublimates into the world and likely returns to the nearest Hallow.%0a+1 Reach, add Matter •••: The lamina becomes immune to the Armor Piercing effect.%0a+1 Reach, add Forces or Matter ••(+): Features of the lamina (e.g. horns, spikes, fangs, etc.) act like natural weapons, with a lethal damage bonus equal to half the added Forces or Matter rating (choose only one), rounded up.%0a%0aManipulate Pattern (Prime 4)%0aPractice: Unravelling%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aWithstand: Stamina%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Medicine, Larceny, Empathy%0aSacrifice is the most potent of magics. A mage may burn through his own life to replenish his magical reserves. Control of the Aetheric Wind allows them to go beyond the limits of their own pattern, reaching further and using those currents not as a blunt instructment but a precise tool with which they can begin to deconstruct the world into its most raw compontent part: Mana. Scouring or Restoring a pattern is the most basic practice a mage can perform, it is an essential quality to the awakened soul. This spell may restore a target’s pattern with mana or damage a pattern for mana using the normal conversion rates. Mages who possess Life’s Second Attainment: Improved Pattern Restoration may choose whether they wish to apply its effects to another living person when the spell is cast.%0aReach +1: An inanimate object (worth at least Availability 2) may be scoured or repaired. Most possess only a single point of mana but rare or priceless objects may contain more. Repairing requires a point of mana per point of structure. Scouring the last point of mana from an inanimate object causes it to crumble and dissipate into nothing.%0a%0aPower Words (Prime ••••/Fate ••••)%0aPractice: Patterning%0aPrimary Factor: Duration%0aWithstand: Resolve%0aCost: 1 Mana%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Academics, Occult, Expression%0aHigh Speech is a conduit to the Realms Above, uniquely formed by the symbols the words entwine and their contextual intent for the Imago. A mixture of Patterning between Prime and Fate apply Supernal perfection to the subject’s High Speech, imbuing succinct words of power with the same symbolic value, intent, and determination as longer and/or repetitive mantras. As long as the subject may speak, High Speech may be used as a secondary reflexive yantra (MtA 119).%0a+1 Reach: This extension of raw intent applies the subject’s unbridled articulations of magical symbolism to their High Speech. The yantra die bonus of using High Speech mantras (MtA 119) is substituted by the subject’s unaltered Occult rating (to a maximum of +5), even if this causes the character to receive a lower die bonus, or none at all. If used in this manner, High Speech may still be used as a reflexive Yantra, but loses its “secondary” quality (and thus cannot go over turn limits on yantra).%0a%0aSanctuary (Prime 4)%0aPractice: (Patterning)%0aCost: (1 Mana)%0aPrimary Factor: (Duration)%0aWithstand: (Resolve) Optional%0a%0aSuggested Rote Skills: (Academics,Occult, Empathy)%0aFor its duration, the caster may choose to grant the subject(s) of Sanctuary the effects of any Mage Armor the caster currently has in effect, at the appropriate level of effect. If the caster changes his Mage Armor, this change also effects the subjects of the Sanctuary. %0aIE, the mage casts Sanctuary, using the Scale Factor to effect two targets. He then raises his Matter 3 Mage Armor for one mana. This would also grant both of the subjects of this spell 3 General Armor which ignores Armor Piercing. If the mage then spent a mana (and a reflexive action) to change to Life 3 Mage Armor, both subjects would lose the 3 General Armor (and the hardening against Armor Piercing), but gain 2 General Armor, and +2 Defense using the higher of (their OWN) wits or dexterity. %0aIf the subject of this spell is unwilling, he may withstand with Resolve, and if the subject is another mage, they may choose, at any time, to use their own Mage Armor instead of that granted by Sanctuary, at the normal cost to change Mage Armor (1 Mana and a Reflexive Action).\\ +1 Reach: The subjects and the caster of the Sanctuary may share the protection of any Mage Armor raised by any subject. IE, the mage cast Sanctuary on another Awakened. That mage has Time 4 Mage Armor in effect. The caster, and any other subjects of the Sanctuary spell, add +4 to their Defense, may use their Defense vs firearms, and if they succeed at a Dodge Action, they can reduce the attackers Initiative by 4 for the remainder of the scene by spending a mana (if they have any). If there are multiple mages as the subject of the Sanctuary, with different Mage Armors active, a subject may choose any of the active Mage Armors (or any they themselves possess), to be activated for 1 mana and a reflexive action.%0a%0aSanctum Sanctorum (Prime ••••)%0aPractice: (Perfecting)%0aPrimary Factor: (Potency)%0aWithstand: Sanctum Rating (if any) Suggested Rote Skills: (Occult, Expression, Academics)%0aWith this spell, the caster may sanctify an area, causing it to act as a Sanctum or increasing the rating of an existing Sanctum, or defile an area or existing Sanctum, reducing it’s rating. If the area is currenly not a Sanctum, it becomes one with a rating equal to the spells potency. If it is a existing Sanctum, the rating is either raised or lowered by 1 (to a maximum of 5, or minimum of &#8722;5), withstood by the current Sanctum rating (absolute value). If an area has a negative Sanctum rating, it SUBTRACTS its value from Gnosis to determine spell control. %0a+2 Reach: For 1 Mana, the effect is Lasting%0a%0aSquaring the Circle (Prime •••• OR optionally Prime ••• Mind ••••)%0aPractice: Patterning%0aPrimary Factor: Duration%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Brawl, Expression, Occult%0aAn enhanced version of Display of Power, rather than merely providing a visible representation of a spell’s Imago, this rote projects a visible and audible representation of what the results would be if those Imagos were expressed in the Fallen World. This provides a more dynamic display that allows the mages involved to show off their personal styles, as well as makes witnessing the duel more interesting.%0aThe sensory effects provided by this spell are obviously illusory (visuals are translucent and sounds are distant and hollow), and will not fool anyone witnessing them that they are real.%0a+2 Reach: For one Mana, any attempt to Counterspell (p. 192) a spell cast within the area gains the rote action quality, as the plainly visible Imago makes the spell easy to decipher. (In many duels, seconds are appointed to stand ready to Counterspell attempts at cheating.)%0a%0aThaumaturgical Forge (Prime 4)%0aPractice: Patterning%0aPrimary Factor: Duration%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Craft, Occult, Science%0aForm follows function and when it comes to the processes of enchantment, patterns and symbols sympathetic to the nature of the enchantment provides clearer focus. Humans have known this for ages. Fire has power. Iron has power. The instruments of the awakened provide a focus to magic and with the right changes to their supernal resonance, a focus to enchantment. This spell empowers a single yantra per potency to be used during the process of Imbuing an item, providing its bonuses to the Gnosis + Prime pool of the Fourth Prime Attainment: Imbue Item. A mage remains limited in the number of yantras used by their gnosis. %0aTool Instruments must in some way be a part of the item being imbued. A cup, a coin, a staff, or some other Order style object, a material that resonates with the purpose of the spell included is another example. A sympathy included may be used to benefit from that sympathetic connection either as a bonus or as a necessary sympathetic connection in its use. An environmental yantra locks the item to that environment but a church is a church is a church, the symbols are the important part. A shadowname’s persona locks the item to the individual mage and those whose persona share a symbolism. It is common for masters and apprentices to share such symbolism.%0aReach +1: Yantras used in the creation of the object are applied as permanent bonuses to its casting total.%0a%0a!!!!Space Spells \\%0aNothing Between (Space •)%0aPractice: Unveiling%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Investigation, Science, Empathy%0aIf space is a lie, it must follow that distance is a lie. By means of this spell, the subject may see across vast distances as though she were immediately next to everything she sees. She could reading small print on the other side of the room or counting hairs on someone’s head as though they were right next to it.%0aMultiply the distance at which the subject can see before suffering penalties by this spell’s Potency. Atmospheric conditions may impact this vision, as it effectively creates a telescope.%0a+1 Reach: This spell allows the subject to see out to a number of miles equal the Mage’s dots in the Space Arcanum.%0a+1 Reach: This spell applies to hearing as well as sight.%0a+1 Reach: This spell can ignore intervening atmospheric conditions.%0aCrossroads (Space ••)%0aPractice: Ruling%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Computers, Politics, Athletics%0aHow many roads must a man walk down, before you call him a man… Roads are but the connections between two points, moving along one is as simple as taking that first step. This spell allows the mage to step upon the beginning of an unobstructed conduit, corridor, path, road, track, trail, or tunnel and reach its terminus immediately or instead to step from one crossroads, junction, or node to the next. This requires that the ‘road’ is navigable. If it is not, the spell ends immediately at an physical obstruction that would prevent further travel, whether it be a door in a hallway, thick underbrush grown over a trail, a tree fallen over a path, or rush hour traffic if one is traveling via automobile.%0a+1 Reach (Add Forces 2): The subject of the spell may use a virtual circuit, electrical conduit, or signal to define the path. This can be exceedingly difficult as many such paths travel unnavigable terrain in one form or another.%0a+1 Reach (Add Prime 2): The subject of the spell may step from one node to the next along a leyline. This can be exceedingly difficult has many such paths traverse over the globe through physical objects.%0a[[#Spiritct]]%0aSpirit Spells%0aEssence Conversion (Spirit/4)%0aPractice: Patterning%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aWithstand: None%0aCost: 1 Essence or 1 mana+Converted Essence or mana%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Occult, Science, Survival%0aBountiful but twisted super power storage of the Fallen world, Essence empowers abilities of spirits and ghosts drawn though nature and humanity in many forms. Patturning it’s energy, can be transfered to other forms of supernatural energy, but with some little efficiency loss.%0aOften best applied in combined cast with Channel Essence, Works with essence held by caster or with freely available energy within area of effect. Choose one conversion function at a time.%0aEssence can be altered and distilled to chosen singular form of Essence Resonance “flavor” or other following options that the mage has encountered previously.\\ Add Prime ••••: As a bonded familiar may do, A mage may Convert potency number of Essence to Mana, or Mana to Essence.%0aAdd Mind ••••: Essence Conversion Includes ability to Convert potency number of Essence to and From Ephemera utilized by Psychic Vampires\\ Add Fate ••••: As some Essence and Glamour share a common sources of Empatho-trophic energy. A mage may Convert potency number of Essence into Glamour, or Glamour into Essence.%0aWith Life ••••: a living fluid substance may be infused to produce a nutritionally viable substance for potent Kindred Vitae at a 1 essence to 1 vitae value. With Life •••• Matter ••••: a non living substance may be used.%0a+2 Reach: The mage may “flavor” the Essence with multiple Resonances she has previously encountered.%0a[[#Timect]]%0a!!!!Time Spells \\%0aTimekeeper (Time •)%0aPractice: Unveiling%0aPrimary Factor: Duration%0aWithstand: None%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Drive, Empathy, Politics%0aBy use of this spell, the subject becomes aware of their absolute time, as well as the relative time between events. For instance, they could measure exactly how many seconds it takes for someone to run a lap without the use of a stopwatch. The subject not only detects when time has been sped up or slowed down, but they become aware of how much time “should” have passed.%0a+1 Reach: By measuring the passage of moments, the subject may look upon a project that has been undertaken and know exactly when it’ll be complete. They could tell you exactly how long until a Kettle boils, the exact second a pregnant woman will give birth, or when a cathedral would be completed under present circumstances. Large scale projects that will be completed far in advance will return a likely range. When an Extended Action is evaluated, it returns how long it’ll take to complete on average and how long each interval is.%0aDusty Trails (Time ••)%0aPractice: Veiling%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aWithstand: Composure%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Investigation, Stealth, Subterfuge%0aThe subject appears completely distinct from one event in their past per Potency. Any mundane attempt to link them to their occluded past through physical or circumstantial evidence fails, and supernatural attempts to link the subject to their past provokes a Clash of Wills. This spell has no effect on memories. Without the aid of Temporal Sympathy, only events in the unchanged past may be occluded.%0a+1 Reach: The subject is can not be tracked as their link to their own footsteps fades.%0aFive O’Clock Shadow (Time ••)%0aPractice: Veiling%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aWithstand: None%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Politics, Survival, Subterfuge%0aThis spell allows a Mage to alter the subject’s apparent age, or to make them rapidly progress or regress through time: someone could be made to appear older or younger; a seed could become a plant, or a plant could become a seed; a plant could be made to bear fruit or wither away as though it were winter; hair and nails could be lengthened and shortened; a kettle could be made to boil or cool. The changes brought on by this spell are illusionary, and some supernatural powers (including Time Mage Sight) may see through them with a successful Clash of Wills%0a+1 Reach: This spell may cause the subject to detect as being from another time entirely, or to detect as moving faster or slower through time, or any other number of temporal anomolies with a Clash of Wills.%0aFog of Ages (Time ••)%0aPractice: Veiling%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aWithstand: Resolve%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Academics, Larceny, Subterfuge%0aBy means of this spell, an Apprentice of Time can hide the past from the subject. One consecutive Scene per Potency of the spell is obscured, meaning the subject can not remember it or acknowledge the results of it. +1 Reach: The scenes obscured by this spell no longer need to be consecutive. %0a+1 Reach: Instead of obscuring entire scenes, this spell can obscure specific events within a scene while leaving the rest of the event unchanged.%0aProcrastination (Time ••)%0aPractice: Shielding%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aWithstand: None%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Occult, Socialize, Survival%0aSure the subject might have just been hit by a truck or eaten by a grue, and yes a Disciple of Time has to deal with the fact that actually happened… but… they’ll get around to it later. This spell protects the subject’s pattern from being changed by what is going on in the present. Up to one Condition, Tilt, or instance of Damage may be suspended per point of Potency. When Damage is suspended, you only suspend a number of health levels equal to Potency. Directly supernatural changes require a Clash of Wills to suspend. When this spell’s duration wears off, all suspended events affect the subject instantly.%0a+1 Reach: Once the spell ends, suspended effects happen at a rate of one per turn.%0aWitnessed Postcognition (Time ••)%0aPractice: Ruling%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Academics, Empathy, Investigation%0aLike the spell it is based on, Shared Postcongition allows a mage to propel a willing target’s senses back in time, though this acts as a breaking point for Sleepers. %0a+1 Reach: The subject can “scrub” the vision like a video, speeding it up, slowing it down, rewinding it, pausing it, etc.%0a+1 Reach: The subject remains aware of her surroundings, and does not lose Defense.%0a%0aArcadian Hours (Time •••)%0aPractice: Fraying%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aWithstand: Target Spell’s Caster’s Arcana Rating%0a‘Suggested Rote Skills: Occult, Drive or Persuasion%0aThe mage targets a spell causing it to be expended more quickly. If successful, this spell causes the targeted spell to elapse at a rate of (1 + Potency) times faster until this spell expires. This cannot reduce the duration beyond 1 remaining turn.%0a%0aChanging the Clock Face (Time •••)%0aPractice: Weaving%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aWithstand: Composure%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Academics, Stealth, Persuasion%0aThis spell allows a mage to cause the subject to rapidly progress or regress through time up to one year per Potency. Unlike Five O’Clock Shadow, these changes are real. However, they produce no mechanical benefit or hinderance, but they may have cosmetic and some narrative impact. For instance, someone made older by this spell would look and feel different, but they would have the same traits and they would live the same length of time after this spell.%0aLong Day (Time •••)%0aPractice: Fraying%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aWithstand: Stamina%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Academics, Socialize, Survival%0aThis spell makes the subject profoundly feel every moment they’ve been awake, even if they’ve just awoken. They gain the Lethargic Condition as though they have been awake for 1 hour per point of Potency and must make an immediate roll to stay awake. At the ST’s discretion, subjects who don’t feel fatigue may be immune to this spell.%0a+1 Reach: The subject takes 1 Bashing Damage per point of Potency which can not be healed so long as the subject has the Lethargic condition.%0aLost Time (Time •••)%0aPractice: Fraying%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aWithstand: Composure%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Academics, Socialize%0aPeople get lost in the moment—they are having fun, or hard at work, and suddenly it’s a few hours later and they are left wondering where the time went? This spell allows the Mage to degrade the subject’s ability to change with the progression of time, inflicting the Insensate Tilt. If they were engaged in a reasonably inane task that requires little important decision making (such as reading, playing a game, watching TV, etc) they will continue to do it.%0a+1 Reach: The subject becomes unaware of their surroundings for the duration of the spell.%0aSequel (Time •••)%0aPractice: Weaving%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aWithstand: Resolve%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Persuasion, Science, Survival%0aWith this spell, a Mage can force someone to relive past trials and victories. The subject gains one mundane, non-persistent Condition or Tilt per dot of the spell’s Potency that they have experienced in the past. The mage can select conditions they know about, or simply seek out conditions that match broad criteria (in which case the subject’s player chooses something appropriate). Without the Temporal Sympathy Attainment, this spell can only cause someone to to be affected by Conditions and Tilts experienced in the Unchanged past.%0a+2 Reach: You may add a supernatural Condition or Tilt so long as you have another Arcana related to your choice rated at ••• or higher.%0aAccelerate Metabolism (Time ••••)%0aPractice: Perfecting%0aPrimary Factor: Duration%0aWithstand: Stamina (If Resisted)%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Medicine or Science%0aThe spell accelerates the bodies natural healing process. Normally the domain of Shamans this spell still see’s use from desperate mages despite it’s drawbacks. For each potency of the spell the subject’s healing times are halved. The spell however puts enourmous strain on the subject which gains the Drained condition once they’ve been under this spell’s influence for a number of hours greater than the target’s Stamina. The condition is persistent until the spells end. Afterwards it can be cleared by eating enough food and getting some rest.%0a+1 Reach: The subject’s accelerated metabolism helps them react faster granting +1 Initiative per Potency.%0a+1 Reach: The mage spends 1 addtional Mana and subject(s) does not gain the Drained condition from this spell%0a%0aCo-Temperus (Time ••••)%0aMana Cost: 1%0aPractice: Patterning%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Larceny, Politics, Subterfuge%0aBy making the present as indeterminable as the future, this spell can allow the subject to participate in multiple ‘potential presents’ simultaneously. The subject splits into one additional version of themselves per Potency. This is not a true division of the subject, but instead is the subject existing in multiple timelines. They share a single Willpower and Mana pool, but are otherwise treated as separate. At the beginning of the subject’s turn, each version of themselves may perform their actions as normal. However, apply the results of only one version of the subject on the world around them, and each version of the subject completely ignores what the others do (sometimes even occupying the same space). For instance, if one version of the subject opens a door and goes through it, all other versions of the subject still have to open the door and walk through it. If at the end of the turn the subject chooses to apply the changes of another version of themselves who did not open the door on the world, then the door would be closed at the end of the turn (having never been opened). Any supernatural powers that affect one or more versions of the subject affects all of them. When the spell ends or is canceled, only one version of the subject sticks around, and that version suffers all of the damage, conditions and tilts suffered by all other versions of themselves, but also gains all knowledge and experiences from the discarded versions of themselves.%0aAdd Mind (••): The different versions of the subject may communicate telepathically.%0a+1 Reach: The different versions of the subject are more insulated from each other. When one or more of them is affected by a supernatural power, then they may roll a Clash of Wills to keep all other versions from themselves from being equally affected.%0a+1 Reach: The version of the subject that remains after the spell expires gains the worst damage from all versions of themselves, instead of all of it.%0aNote: A Space •••• equivalent of this spell exists, but relies on a duplication of the character’s spatial presence instead of timelines.%0a%0aEncore (Time ••••)%0aPractice: Patterning%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aWithstand: Composure%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Expression, Science%0aBy means of this spell, the Mage can cause someone to repeat the actions of the past. Without the Temporal Sympathy attainment, the Mage chooses one instant action the subject performed in the unchanged past. The subject performs that same action on their next turn. They perform the same motions and thoughts they did, without regards to their surroundings. This makes interacting with a changing world imprecise (i.e. striking an opponent who has moved would cause them to strike at the same spot).%0a+1 Reach: Instead of an instant action, the subject will repeat an entire Scene. This reach may be selected multiple times, causing the subject to repeat more than one scene’s worth of actions.%0a+1 Reach: The subject will adjust their motions to try and produce the same result as their prior actions. Someone who read a book will pick up that same book to read if it is handy. Someone who threw a punch would throw a punch at the same target if they are nearby. If the subject can’t achieve the same result with only minor adjustments, they will mime the action normally.%0a+3 Reach: As above, but the Mage may select new targets for the subject’s actions. The decision for what replaces the old target is made when the spell is cast, and that decision persists for the duration of the spell.%0aHung Action (Time ••••)%0aPractice: Patterning%0aPrimary Factor: Duration%0aWithstand: None%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Medicine, Subterfuge%0aOne mundane instant action performed by the subject while this spell is active becomes “hung” in time. Resolve the effects of the action then, but instead of performing that action the subject merely passes their turn. When this spell’s duration ends or it is canceled, the suspended action affects the world. Many mages use the the Fate •• attainment Conditional Duration on Hung Action, so it releases its action under set circumstances.%0aAdd Fate (••): Instead of suspending an action entirely, the Mage may suspend only their success. The suspended action appears to happen, yet it looks like a failure (or, at the subject’s option, a dramatic failure—this does not grant a beat). When the spell ends, it turns out the action was a success the entire time.%0a+1 Reach: The subject may hang one additional mundane action while this spell is active. This Reach may be selected multiple times.%0a+2 Reach: This spell may apply to Extended Actions as well as Instant Actions.%0aStopwatch (Time ••••)%0aPractice: Unraveling%0aPrimary Potency: Potency%0aWithstand: Resolve%0aCost: 1 Mana%0aSuggested Rote Skills: Occult, Science, Intimidation%0aThe subject’s journey through time is slowed almost to the point of stopping. They attempt to do something, only to have the actions play out in slow motion as they are witnesses to their own body. To them the world moves with sudden, great speed. The subject’s Speed and Defense are reduced to 0. They declare their action at the beginning of the round, but it only takes place at the end of the round (in the order of the Mage’s choosing in the case of multiple subjects). Everyone else’s action coints as interrupting their action.%0a+1 Reach: The subject suffers the Immobilized Tilt as the slowing of Time becomes that much more all encompassing.%0aWeave The Tapestry (Time ••••)%0aMana Cost: None%0aPractice: Patterning%0aPrimary Factor: Potency%0aWithstand: Resolve%0aA Mage may use this spell to guide the subject through multiple potential futures, ensuring that they pick what is best (or worst) for them. The Mage may cause the subject to reroll a number of mundane rolls equal to this spell’s potency. The mage chooses which rolls are rerolled, and whether to keep the old roll or use the new one. No dicepool may be rerolled more than once by this effect, even if another effect forces a reroll (in that case, you may perform a Clash of Wills to choose which roll to keep).%0a+2 Reach: This spell may affect spellcasting rolls and supernatural rolls.%0a[&#8593; back to top]%0a%0aAll Factions%0a[&#8593; back to top]%0a%0aDirectory: Mage the Awakening%0aAbout the Venue	History	Society	Locations	Player Guide%0a%0aPortland, OR %0aDistricts%0a%0aChangeling %0aPlayer Guide%0a%0aMage %0aPlayer Guide%0a%0aMortal %0aPlayer Guide%0a%0aVampire %0aPlayer Guide%0a%0aWerewolf %0aPlayer Guide%0aEdit - History - Print - Recent Changes - Search%0aPage last modified on August 07, 2017, at 05:34 PM%0aThe Storytelling System, Beast the Primordial, Changeling the Lost, Chronicles of Darkness, Demon the Descent, Mage the Awakening, Vampire the Requiem, and Werewolf the Forsaken ©2014-2016 CCP hf and published by Onyx Path Publishing.%0aProduced by Jeff Vandenberg.

It makes the target dead or undead creature act as if its body was still alive.  It does not however remove any weaknesses of the body, such as sunlight vulnerability Etc. The more powerful the dead creature is, the harder it is to give it the trappings of life, it therefore has a reflexive Withstand even if the undead in question wishes to be subjected to the effect. The withstand equals the blood potency, rank, or what ever equivilent powerstat the undead possesses.  A basic corpse has zero powerstat, as well as those animated by other uses of the death arcana. The spell will only give the trappings of being alive. The subject will breath, have warm skin, a pulse, and be able to emulate the other basic functions of life, such as eating and drinking food. Corpses will not stink, bloat or otherwise decompose, and appear to be asleep. The subject will register as alive to most mundane senses and objects, and use of supernatural powers to determine the status will cause a Clash of Wills.  It will NOT prevent any of the other normal functions, requirements, or weaknesses of the subject. A vampire may eat, but gains no sustenance from the food, and does not heal like a living person. They are still vulnerable to sunlight, and require vitae to function. Conversely, they do not NEED to breath, eat, etc., still being immune to suffocation, starvation (from deprivation from normal food or drink), and still retain their resistance to injury and other factors.%0a

However, we don’t want to entirely prevent ‘on the fly’ magic or Creative Thaumaturgy, so we’re implementing the following rules:%0a%3c %0a%3c Creative Thaumaturgy may be performed in staff-run scenes ‘on the fly’, at the staff member’s discretion. Being allowed to perform a spell in a staff-run scene without it being finalized (see below), however, does NOT guarantee that it can be used again, as the mechanics will generally be simplified and made to suit the current situation.%0a%3c Creative Thaumaturgy spells may be submitted to the “Rules Master” group via a “Custom Item/Power” request, where it will be discussed and balanced as needed. There’s no specific time limit between submissions, but please only submit CT for spells you’re capable of casting and actively plan to use.%0a%3c Once approved, Creative Thaumaturgy spells will be made publicly available on the wiki, and can be cast and used by anyone as if they came from an official source.%0a%3c If no staff is present, you may only perform approved and published spells in scenes.%0a%3c Note that for now, only spells can be submitted, not custom Reach effects for published spells, to avoid difficulties cross-referencing.%0a%3c Exceptional Successes on Casting%0a%3c The listed option of ignoring all Withstand ratings on an exceptional success in spellcasting is not available.%0a%3c Pattern Restoration%0a%3c Pattern Restoration is not able to remove Conditions or Tilts that are supernatural in nature; they need to be removed with appropriate spells (or resolved normally). It can remove mundane conditions/tilts that are applied because of supernatural powers, however (but if the power’s still active, this may be a Clash of Wills or it may just be re-applied).%0a%3c %0a%3c Sleepwalkers%0a%3c TO clarify, Sleepwalkers are not mechanically considered a “half-template” for the Mage venue regardless of how involved in the Mage venue the Sleepwalker may be. Instead, Sleepwalker is a classification for characters who are immune to the Curse, cause no Dissonance, do not increase Paradox and remember what they’ve seen (as pertains to the Supernal). Additionally, characters who fall under this classification can purchase Sleepwalker Merits (defined as those with “Prerequisite: Sleepwalker”, NOT “Prerequisite: Mortal”, or “Prerequisite: Integrity”).%0a%3c Character types who are considered Sleepwalkers (Note: Only 1 of the following is necessary):%0a%3c %0a%3c Mortals who have purchased the Sleepwalker merit%0a%3c Mortals who have purchased an “internal” Supernatural merit (Chronicles of Darkness)%0a%3c Changelings, Vampires, Werewolves, Fae-touched, Ghouls, Wolf-blooded or any other supernatural template.%0a%3c Ephemeral beings and similar ‘Non-Template’ entities, like Strix and Oneroi, do not count as Sleepwalkers for the purpose of related mechanics, but nor do they count as Sleepers for the sake of paradox.%0a%3c Unsafe Relinquishment%0a%3c Relinquishing a spell unsafely (with a willpower point) is an act of hubris at the Understanding level without an immediate need to. An inured spell is of course not affected by this.%0a%3c Clarification: Boons%0a%3c Fate spells that grant a boon cannot provide a Potency dice bonus to casting dice pools, even if the spell lists affecting spellcasting pools as its own Reach option. Dice Tricks (e.g 9-again) affect spellcasting normally if Reach is used.%0a%3c Clarification: Combined Spells%0a%3c Combined spells have the same factors (if their Primary differs, choose one), including specified targets/area, unless a Reach is spent to separate the Scale.%0a%3c Clarification: Nimbus Tilt%0a%3c Nimbus Tilts only affect those actively witnessing them, meaning those using Mage Sight (or other supernatural powers that can perceive it), or anyone when the Nimbus is deliberately flared; this also includes the offender when the Nimbus is used defensively. However, the mage flaring the Nimbus is not affected by their own Tilt in any case.%0a%3c Clarification: Resistance and Withstanding%0a%3c Merits and abilities that subtract from a type of power’s resisted dice pool instead raises Withstand by 1/2 the amount (round up) when dealing with spells.%0a%3c Merits and abilities that specifically treat the trait as higher just do exactly that.%0a%3c Clarification: Shielding Spells%0a%3c As listed in the Creative Thaumaturgy rules, Shielding spells will only protect against a number of supernatural effects equal to the spell’s potency for a given casting.%0a%3c Policy: Staff and Paradox%0a%3c Releasing Paradox always requires a staff member present to direct the paradox Reach; it’s recommended not to release paradox for downtime casting%0a%3c Internal Paradoxes require a staff member to be notified if more than 5 successes are rolled beyond what’s absorbed by Wisdom, as a new Paradox condition is likely to be needed.%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Cabal Creation%0a%3c To create a create a request ticket or include in sanctioning request the following completed template%0a%3c %0a%3c Template Example%0a%3c :Name: Cabal Name%0a%3c Members:%0a%3c * -Shadow Name 1 - First Last Name%0a%3c * -Shadow Name 2 - First Last Name%0a%3c * -Shadow Name 3 - First Last Name%0a%3c :Theme: Theme that binds the cabal%0a%3c Rites & Tenants - As per Lex Magica%0a%3c *Rite of Acceptance%0a%3c *Rite of Wisdom%0a%3c *Rite of Crossing%0a%3c *Rite of Hospitality%0a%3c *Rite of Sanctum%0a%3c *The Tenet of the Veil%0a%3c *The Tenet of Hubris%0a%3c *The Tenet of Protection%0a%3c *The Tenet of War%0a%3c Locations%0a%3c *Neighborhood: Location%0a%3c *Safe Place: Location%0a%3c *Sanctum: Location%0a%3c *Hallow - Yes/No%0a%3c *Demense - Yes/No%0a%3c Shared Dots%0a%3c * -Shadow Name1- First Last Name 2 Dots Safe Space, 1 Dot Sanctum, 1 Dot Hallow%0a%3c * -Shadow Name2- First Last Name 1 Dots Safe Space, 1 Dot Sanctum, 1 Dot Hallow%0a%3c * -Shadow Name3- First Last Name 1 Dots Safe Space, 1 Dot Sanctum, 1 Dot Hallow%0a%3c * -Shadow Name4- First Last Name 0%0a%3c :Description: Details about the cabals goals.%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Consilium Status%0a%3c Status 1%0a%3c Any mage that resides in the city of Portland that has declared themself to a member of the Consilium’s Leadership Ally - Any exemplary resident of the Consilium’s domain who has served the Consilium.%0a%3c Status 2%0a%3c Liegeman/Liegewoman - Any mage who represents a cabal to the Consilium or who has earned special recognition for services to the Consilium.%0a%3c Status 3%0a%3c Mages at rank 3+ May be appointed the following position of service:%0a%3c Sentinel - The Enforcer of the Consilium’s Law, tasked with patrolling its Sanctum and its Borders.%0a%3c Herald - The Voice of the Consilium, tasked with acting as emissary amongst the Wise and distributing the edicts of the Consilium and its Leadership.%0a%3c Factotum - The Prosecutor of the Consilium’s Law and the Lex Magica, tasked with prosecuting those members of the Wise who break the Lex as it has been established.

Sleepwalkers are required to prove that even though they are not mages they will and have adapted the Adamant Way. Once they have proven themselves to the Adamantine Arrow they will receive a special pin, this pin identifies the individual as someone whom has provided honorable service. The pin also grants supervised access to Arrow Hall Conference Room within the Embassy Hotel. %0a%3c Emblem of the Banner Warden%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Players with knowledge of the supernatural and support of the Embassy accords may take Status 0 in the Adaminte Arrow. Taking Status 0 offers no benefit or obligation in continued support the Mage Faction. After completing a story arch that includes Investigation and Combat alongside an Adamantite Arrow players may purchase status 1 with Narrator or Story Master approval. Status 1 requires the individual has sworn an oath to defend the city and must answer a call to arms if made by the Adamantine Arrow.%0a%3c Mages%0a%3c Status 1 - Talon%0a%3c A mage who has been received into the Arrows may take the title Talon. It is considered an honor to be accepted into the ranks of the Adamantine Arrow. Mages from any other order can earn the first rank, Talon, without conflict with their primary order. Mages are expected to present themselves as competent, respectful, and diligent while in the service as an Arrow. Failure to do so has rather undesirable results. %0a%3c Gaining status 0 in the Adamantine Arrows is rather easy. Loyal,extended service in the defense of the city is the bare minimum for this rank. Gaining Status 1 from outside the Adamantine Arrow is a lengthy and challenging process. The mage must prove they are capable of maintaining the balance between their order and the Tenants of the Adamantine Arrow. Out of Order mages that gain status 1 in the Adamantine Arrow are granted supervised access to Diamond Securities above ground facilities and underground Labs.%0a%3c Status 2 - First Talon%0a%3c Famuli (singular famulus) of the Adamantine Arrow form the backbone of the order. Rising higher in Status than First Talon requires a great deal of dedication to or ambition for the order itself, and Arrows have other concerns splitting their attention — Sleeper relations, protecting the Consilium, their cabals, their pupils, their mentors and so on. An Arrow might comfortably remain within his duties as a First Talon his entire Awakened life, and suffer no stigma from his order because of it.%0a%3c Mages from any Order can earn the rank of Talon. But they can not exceed rank 3 in their primary order should they chose to dedicate themselves more intensively to the Arrows.%0a%3c Status 3 - First Talon%0a%3c Position of Service: A member of the Adamantine Arrow who has earned the rank of first Talon. Dedicated themselves to the order, projecting themselves as the and takes a position of service like Herald or Sentinel.%0a%3c Status 4 - Thunderbolt Guardian%0a%3c Preparation is the key to victory, so the order enshrines this principle in the rank of Thunderbolt Guardian. Thunderbolt Guardians are teachers and counselors, versed in several useful fields, and also personally apply their abilities to operations.%0a%3c Status 5 - Adamant Sage (PC)%0a%3c The Adamant Sage is by far the hardest rank to achieve and maintain.

Low-ranking emissaries are usually emissaries to their cabals, while higher-ranked ones may be asked to act as the Assembly’s ambassador to a Caucus or Consilium.%0a%3c Minuteman%0a%3c The citizen-soldiers of the Free Council, minutemen are those who have proven themselves defenders of the Council’s goals and members. They are expected to respond immediately to summons by the Council’s members, and to fight valiantly, whether in physical and magical conflict, or in the social arena. Additionally those who seek to gain status with the Adamantine Arrow must inform a ranking member of the Assembly.%0a%3c Syndic%0a%3c Politicians, the ideal of the Syndic is the Greek debater - clear-eyed, making people understand the nuances of the problems a people face, and then offering wise and charismatic ways to solve those problems.%0a%3c Citizen Agent%0a%3c Spies, covert agents and special forces, the citizen agents of the Council are regarded with great respect as heroes.

They are a firm believer in the beliefs of the GoV. This is the most common rank for members of the GoV. Some mages may never exceed the rank of Famulus because they failed some aspect of their veils. But instead of being informed they become trapped at this level.

They manage the Labyrinth, upholding the order’s network of influence and misdirection, and they recruit new members, sending them through the Veils. An epopt rarely works alone. She directs other Guardians to support conspiracies and initiate novices through the Veils. Epopts are always experienced Guardians, but they rarely rise to the highest ranks of the order. The Guardians of the Veil value the Labyrinth, but try to keep its games at a distance.%0a%3c %0a%3c Titles of Service%0a%3c Culto%0a%3c Cultors create and oversee the maintenance of Labyrinths. Though they are not responsible for the ways in which the caucus will use the Labyrinths, they are responsible for seeing that the Epopt’s decisions are made manifest in the Labyrinths.%0a%3c Emissary%0a%3c As many caucuses avoid revealing the identity of their Epopt - or sometimes, even the identities of their membership at all - the emissary acts as the public face of the Guardians to the local Consilium and other orders. Emissaries attend to public and private meetings, even being the one to deliver threats.%0a%3c Susceptor%0a%3c The elite spies of the Order, Susceptors are the field agents of the Guardians, their identities usually known only to Epopts.

This essentially allows the Mage to see in any amount of darkness, though if no light at all is available, he’ll only see in varying shades of textureless blackness. By default this spell only reveals mundane darkness to the user’s senses.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The sense extends to the supernatural; anything supernaturally concealed that’s covered with shadows or darkness can still be perceived by the Mage if he wins the ensuing Clash of Wills. This will also outline ‘sentient’ creatures of darkness as separate from other shadows, including mages using Shadow Flesh, or creatures from various shadowy realms….%0a%3c %0a%3c Invite the Grave (Death •••)%0a%3c Practice: Perfecting%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Stamina%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Medicine, Science, Intimidation%0a%3c This spell enhances the course of Entropy, making those that suffer from it feel the effects that much more intensely. The next time the subject suffers at least a point of damage over the Duration, increase the damage suffered by this spell’s Potency; the damage is the same type as that originally suffered. This can affect a maximum number of damaging effects equal to the spell’s Potency.%0a%3c %0a%3c Nights Grasp (Death •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Cost: 1 Mana%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Occult, Academics, Science%0a%3c Night’s Grasp enables the caster to form starry black tendrils from the very shadows themselves. These tendrils can strike, grapple, hinder, and restrict under the command of their creator acting as the mages inpromtu defender until the spell is dropped. %0a%3c One tendril is created per target factor; these tendrils have a brawl dice pool equal to the spell’s Potency, no defense, and health equal to the caster’s Death rating. The tendrils act on the Mage’s initiative, but being mindless, do not perform acts on their own; one tendril per turn may be given a simple command (attack X, defend Y) reflexively by the caster, or an instant action may be used to give them all the same command. They will continue to attempt the action until it can’t be done anymore or a new command is given (or the spell ends, of course).%0a%3c +1 Reach: The caster’s Brawl rating is added to the tendrils’ dice pool.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The tendrils can affect Death-aspected Twilight.%0a%3c %0a%3c Open Avernian Gateway (Death •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Intimidation, Occult %0a%3c This spell targets an Avernian Gateway, opening it for the duration and allowing anyone (from either side) to travel through it until it closes again; this applies the Underworld Gate condition to the area. Any attempt to close the gateway before the spell ends provokes a Clash of Wills.%0a%3c +2 Reach: The Gateway only opens in one direction, allowing the Mage to travel through it into the Underworld without allowing ghosts out, for instance.%0a%3c %0a%3c Suppress Decay (Death •••)%0a%3c Practice: Fraying%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Medicine, Athletics, Survival%0a%3c The mage is capable of stifling entropic energy, causing wounds and other injuries to be rendered superficial and harmless. For the duration, 2 points of pre-existing bashing damage per point of Potency can be ignored by the subject, as if they were undamaged. The underlying wound will heal at about twice the normal speed during this time, as well, since the body needn’t deal with the actual ‘harm’ itself. If the duration ends before the wound heals, the damage for any unhealed wounds reappears (accounting for the increased healing speed).%0a%3c This will also prevent bleeding out and other injuries that worsen over time for the duration.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The spell can suppress one pre-existing lethal damage per Potency instead of 2 bashing.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The mage may suppress a pre-existing Personal Tilt caused by Damage, such as Arm Wrack, causing the damage to become entirely superficial (if disturbing).%0a%3c +2 Reach: The effect is Lasting (but the superficial wounds still take time to heal)%0a%3c Advanced Shadow Crafting (Death ••••)%0a%3c Practice: Unraveling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Academics, Intimidation, Occult%0a%3c While a weaker version of this spell exists that crafts items from shadows and solidifies them for use by the mage, this more potent spell creates weapons and items that inflict weakness on opponents using the disabling nature of the Underworld towards the living. Indeed, these are not merely shadows, the shadows used in this spell are forged from death and have a devastating affect of living flesh, and their potent shadow-forged weapons strike not only the flesh of corpses and dead creatures, but affect their very being. The maximum durability, damage rating, and equipment bonus from objects crafted from shadow increases to match the rating in the casters Death Arcana. Additionally, attacks from these weapons deal lethal damage, even to Undead and Ephemeral beings (related to the Death aspect of Twilight) that normally downgrade such damage.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The shadows are potent manifestations of the decay of death, and successful attacks inflict the Sick (Grave) tilt while in combat on living targets.%0a%3c +2 Reach and 1 Mana: The weapon does Aggravated damage as it not only attacks the body, rotting away flesh and decaying bone, but it damages the very essence of the creature as well. This deals aggravated damage against creatures that normally downgrade most forms of damage, including Vampires and ephemeral beings. While this reach is in effect, any weapon forged by the shadows is considered a 0A weapon.%0a%3c %0a%3c Forbid Injury (Death ••••)%0a%3c Practice: Unraveling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Medicine, Athletics, Survival%0a%3c An Adept of Death is capable of not only stifling injury, but making even the most egregious wounds incapable of actually harming one’s life force, stripping away the actual danger present in any form of injury. Each level of potency causes 2 pre-existing lethal damage (i.e that were there upon casting) to be ignored by the subject, as if not present at all, although the superficial wounds remain, and become dangerous again after the duration ends. However, the underlying injury heals at twice the speed for the duration, as there’s no true harm for the body to struggle against. %0a%3c This will also prevent bleeding out and other injuries that worsen over time for the duration.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The spell can suppress pre-existing aggravated damage. Cost: 1 mana%0a%3c +1 Reach: The subject may dedicate a Potency to ignore a single pre-existing physical tilt for the duration, rendering any injury or impedance entirely superficial, barring actual removal of an appendage or other body part.%0a%3c +2 Reach: The effect is Lasting (but the superficial wounds still take time to heal).%0a%3c Fate Spells%0a%3c Between the Lines (Fate •/Prime •)%0a%3c Practice: Knowing%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Academics, Occult, Expression%0a%3c This spell reveals key information about the form and intent of symbols, whether these are cultural (e.g. art, status items), lingual (e.g. hobo-signs, alien glyphs), or magical (wards, curses, etc.) As examples, the subject may interpret a painting as reflective of melancholy over social issues, a ring or scar as denoting accomplishment or status in a public or secret society, a series of hobo-signs marking a dangerous passage, or arcane symbols as denoting intent to warn, curse, harm, disease, seal, or summon.%0a%3c The spell offers no information about the creator, the symbol’s origins, or the symbol/item’s veracity (e.g. if a piece is fake or truly gilded). Furthermore, the spell offers no information about follow-through: threatening symbols are no guarantee of violence, nor is a sealing symbol proof of supernatural power and/or its success — only its intent to seal. The spell reveals, exclusively, information about the intent of the symbol itself.%0a%3c +1 Reach: Short visions inform the Mage about the symbol’s origins, adding Potency to rolls involving the interpretation or study of symbols.%0a%3c +2 Reach: Spend a point of Mana. The Mage can cast this spell as a Reflexive action.%0a%3c %0a%3c Counting the Magic Beans (Fate •)%0a%3c Practice: Knowing%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Withstand: None%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Empathy, Streetwise, Survival%0a%3c By tapping into the web of narrative-as-Destiny told by the Hedge, the mage becomes keenly aware of the characters and plants native to the Hedge nearby. She feels the gravity of their narrative as it tries to draw the Mage in to their tropes. Most mages specify certain types of characters to detect, such as “Hobs and Goblin Fruit,” or “only Huntsmen.”%0a%3c After successfully casting this spell, the mage can detect all the specified types of characters within the spell’s area Scale, or that enter the spell’s area while it remains in effect. The Mage also knows what the characters are under the Mask, if applicable. The Hedge’s thorns are uniquely immune to being processed by this spell.%0a%3c Add Mind 1: The mage can detect the presence of Oneiroi, Baubles, Cobblethought, and Dreamspun items.%0a%3c Reach +1: The Mage can detect things transformed by the Hedge, such as Hedgebeasts and Changelings.%0a%3c Reach +1: The Mage can specify characters by their role or function so long as it has been made an intrinsic part of their nature, allowing the Mage to specifically look for “Goblin Merchants” or “Poisonous Goblin Fruit.” When combined with the above Reach, the Mage can look for Changelings with specific Kiths (but not Seemings, as the Hedge is not responsible for that transformation).%0a%3c Find the Path (Fate •)%0a%3c Practice: Knowing%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Withstand: None%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Academics, Occult, Survival%0a%3c This spell can detects the presence and location of Irises leading to or from the Hedge in the area of effect of the spell’s Scale. Add this spell’s Potency to rolls made by the subject to navigate to it.%0a%3c Reach +1: The subject becomes aware of one type of topographical feature within the Hedge in addition to any Iris’s, such as (but not limited to) Trods and Hollows. By adding Mind 1, this may include Dream Bastions. This Reach may be selected multiple times.%0a%3c Supernal Targeting (Fate •, Time •, Space •)%0a%3c Practice: Knowing%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Firearms, Athletics, Investigation%0a%3c A mixture of knowing how the next fleeting moments will affect a subjects target’s position, intimacy with the correlation between objects spacially, and a preternatural sense of timing are molded together to allow a mage to begin preparing his actions for efficiency, well before conventional precepts with eerie fluidity. This spell makes aiming a thrown or fired weapon take less time. In lieu of spending a turn aiming, the aim action’s use-time is reduced to an Instant Action. In most cases, this allows a Mage to aim and move. Also, as long as the Mage does not change the target(s) of this accuracy, attacks do not reset the bonus received from aiming. If the target of the aim action moves outside of the Mage’s line of sight, the aim is disrupted normally. Sleeper Witnesses suffer Quiescence normally.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The spells affected aim actions are made reflexively, though this does not allow for multiple aim actions to be taken in one turn.%0a%3c %0a%3c Summoning (Fate ••)%0a%3c Practice: Ruling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Withstand: Resolve%0a%3c Cost: None%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Investigation, Expression and Persuasion%0a%3c Fated things and people are pulled together as if by gravity and with this spell the mage compells that law of Fate summoning to her side lost things and people.%0a%3c The mage cast this spell on her target then at anytime during it’s duration she may sense how to reach her target. She doesn’t know the whole route to take just what steps to take to find them but she does have a general sense in what direction her target lies. She may invoke this ability a number of times equal to the spells Potency.%0a%3c If the Object or Person is within the immediate area the target becomes apparent in someway to the caster, perhaps a soft wind blows making it rattle or a streetlight turns on highlighting it. If the optional Reach effect is taken instead the person or object makes it’s way back to the mage. Typically this takes up to 24 hours if the target is in the same city but could take longer for longer distances.%0a%3c People that are being summoned have the impression their being called by the caster and have a rough idea how to find the caster but nothing concrete. Events will conspire to lead and harass the target to come to the caster of this spell. If they actively resist this spell’s call they suffer a Hex equal to this spell’s potency so long as they continue to ignore the calling (in such a case, they find it difficult to stay away, but not impossible).%0a%3c +2 Reach: The target makes its way back to the caster, as described.%0a%3c +3 Reach: As above but the target hurries back in half the normal time (if not resisting the call).%0a%3c %0a%3c Freedom (Fate •••)%0a%3c Practice: Perfecting%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Larceny, Survival%0a%3c Using this spell, the mage’s potential is safeguarded against the mundane meddling of those seeking to control her using a more mundane methodology. Hands slip free, keys are dropped and bounce just barely into reach, the cuffs failed to lock tight enough, or the chair the mage is tied to finally decides to break after it’s years of service are through, leaving the subject surrounded with a means to cut her loosened bonds. Efforts to grapple the subject of the spell are reduced to a chance die, regardless of how easily achieved the grapple was established, though the subject suffers similar effects regarding her ability to ensnare subjects as well. Mundane binding of any form, on their own, fail automatically, and Supernatural effects that employ physical means of trapping the subject provoke a Clash of Wills (up to Potency times). This spell fails if the subject is unconscious or otherwise unable to take action%0a%3c +1 Reach: The effect only works one way, the subject(s) of the magic being able to bind and tie their own targets are unrestricted by the magic, but the target’s own rolls are not penalized to resist these attempts (such as when doing any maneuver other than Breaking Free in a grapple).%0a%3c Add Time 4: One such escape attempt’s affected dice roll each turn during the spells Duration can be made as a reflexive action, as the mage applies this strain of defiance over time in the blink of an eye.%0a%3c %0a%3c Make It Look Easy (Fate •••)%0a%3c Practice: Ruling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Composure%0a%3c The subjects exceptional success threshold for mundane rolls are expanded or reduced by the spell’s Potency during the spell’s Duration (to a minimum of 1), up to a number of times equal to Potency. This spell has no control over whether or not success is actually achieved, what it does is increase or decrease the forceful effects of success, so that even meager efforts can make for a higher grade of results, or mighty efforts met with modest effects. This spell can make capable experts appear to be talented charlatans, or make up amateur taxi drivers to seem like trained Hollywood stunt devils.%0a%3c +2 Reach: The spell affects spell-casting rolls and supernatural powers, but may not reduce the threshold below 3, no matter the potency.%0a%3c %0a%3c Unlocking the Secret Garden (Fate •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Withstand: None%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Crafts, Larceny, Survival%0a%3c This spell allows the Mage to force an Iris leading into or out of the Hedge open or closed, regardless of its associated keys. This may require a Clash of Wills in the case of Gateways being kept open or closed by another being.%0a%3c Reach +1: The Mage may instead change one detail of the Gate’s Key or means of access per Potency. A gate that opens to red headed stepchildren that spin around backwards three times might be changed to opening for anyone, that claps their hands three times for two Potency.%0a%3c Baleful Blade (Fate 4)%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Weaponry, Firearms, Athletics%0a%3c Sometimes the knife needs a little push to find its mark, to hit those soft points and nerves, to punch between the ribs. A bat needs the oh-so slightest perfection in the swing to knock a collar bone in half, and a bullet needs that extra centimeter to the left to pierce the heart. With this spell an acanthus can urge the strings of fate to tug it in the right direction, making even the smallest pen knife an instrument of doom for its victim. The target of this spell has its weapon rating increased by +1 per potency.%0a%3c +1 reach: The weapon also gains Armor Piercing equal to the spell’s potency.%0a%3c %0a%3c Charmed Life (Fate ••••)%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration %0a%3c ‘Withstand: Composure if resisted%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Occult, Socialize or Persuasion%0a%3c The subject of the spells enjoys or endures a life of extremes. A blessed life does away with minor inconvienances such as too many red lights or stubbed toes. They can also be blessed in the following ways to a maximum number of times equal to the spell’s potency. Each use is reflexive and can only be used once per turn, and not th esame turn as the same condition was expended or resolved.%0a%3c %0a%3c Gain the Charmed Condition%0a%3c Gain the Steadfast Condition%0a%3c Gain the Resolute Condition%0a%3c Downgrade the level of damage by one category against one attack (Can’t downgrade Aggravated damage unless Reach was spent for this effect)%0a%3c Meanwhile a cursed subject suffers indignities at every turn, spilled coffee to running late to work. For each potency of the spell the subject suffers one of the following effects whenever it’s dramatically appropriate as determined by the Storyteller. As a charmed individual above an effect from this spell can only occur once per turn and is reflexive.%0a%3c %0a%3c An exceptional success becomes a normal success%0a%3c A failure becomes a dramatic failure%0a%3c Damage from an attack is upgraded one level (Can’t be upgraded to Aggravated damage unless Reach was spent for this effect)%0a%3c Apply a negative condition or Tilt appropriate to the situation%0a%3c +1 Reach: The spell can downgrade or upgrade damage from/to Aggravated%0a%3c %0a%3c What If Scenario (Fate ••••/Time •)%0a%3c Practice: Patterning %0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: (Occult; Science, academics)%0a%3c The mage can look into a subject’s possible future and see what could be if certain strings of fate were manipulated. This allows the mage to divine where altering the fabric of fate may affect the future, or potentially seeing what the outcome of a particular destiny may be. Without reach, the mage can only dvine the effects of their own fate and changes they might make. This spell can see far into the future, allowing the mage to see most likely long-term consequences of their current fate. The mage may incorporate as many possible shifts to their fate as potency. Looking too far from the present increases the likelihood of the answer being superseded by the point the future becomes the present. The Storyteller must decide what the future holds, taking into account the nature of the story as well as cues from the mage’s description of the “what if scenario.”%0a%3c While viewing the possible future, the mage loses all Defense and may not take any actions or cast further spells. %0a%3c +1 Reach: The mage can specify fates external to their own in the What If Scenario.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The mage can specify a specific date and time in the future to perceive the results of the What If scenario at that time.%0a%3c Forces Spells%0a%3c Matter Conversions%0a%3c The following spells from Matter can be used with equivalent Forces on/relating to electronic/computerized devices.%0a%3c %0a%3c Machine Invisibility%0a%3c Discovery Protocol (Forces •)%0a%3c Practice: Knowing%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Computer, Intimidate, Larceny%0a%3c Modern technology still requires a known piece of information to ask a question of a machine. The awakened Discovery Protocol circumvents this necessity of known information to extract information that is available for request by the nature of the system. This spell extracts a hybrid DHCP-ARP cache from an active system. A table of this type acts as a symbolic sympathetic yantra to each device on it, and Representational to the device from which it was extracted.%0a%3c +1 Reach: Rather than a copy of existing data, the device produces a brand new, specialized table, increasing the primary device’s sympathetic strength from the table to material (though this fades to representational after a month, as normal).%0a%3c +1 Reach: By providing the faintest spark of power, an unpowered device becomes a valid target.%0a%3c Add Spirit 1: A spiritual resident or representation of a system becomes a valid target, providing its sympathetic name as well. A spirit may withstand with its Rank.%0a%3c %0a%3c Magnetometer (Forces •)%0a%3c Practice: Unveiling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Science, Academics, Subterfuge%0a%3c The subject is able to sense metal and magnetic materials, including the size and location of the object; similar to a magnetometer at security checkpoints, but with more precision.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The target knows the shape of the object or objects detected.%0a%3c %0a%3c Programmer’s eye (Forces •)%0a%3c Practice: Knowing%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Computer, Investigation, Science%0a%3c Under the programmer’s eye, all code remains mysterious until it unfolds, sloppy notations, personal quirks run rampant through the system. However, by undergoing a moment of epiphany under this effect, the subject gains a complete understanding of the software or the data. It’s intended purpose is obvious and available; as is its absence. Corruption, Encryption, and Mistakes that interferes with normal operations are also revealed, but not immediately understood and must be corrected through other means.%0a%3c +1 Reach: Understanding the function of the examined code grants the subject 8-again on all actions using the studied code. Only the most recently studied object gains this benefit as the supernal clarity fades from the mind’s eye to replace it with another.%0a%3c +2 Reach: As above, plus the spell reveals all potential uses of an object, fanned out in a vast array of Supernal symbols around the object. Focusing on a particular use might require a reflexive Wits + Composure roll for especially complex items.%0a%3c Add Fate •: The mage names a particular task when casting the spell (e.g. “get leverage on Carruthers,” “translate the Codex Afire”). Any data that might help with that task seem to loom larger, to be more digitally present, and are immediately obvious to the subject as soon as she lays eyes on them.%0a%3c %0a%3c Run Software (Forces •)%0a%3c Practice: Compelling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Computer, Drive, Expression%0a%3c Computers have only begun to scratch the surface of their potential and as man reaches their imagination extends towards a new step that could not have been considered before that moment. Running a program within a computer system is among the simplest of digital magics available to those who delve into this type of magic. The affected program simply responds as the mage wishes. Any action requiring a skill roll treats the spell’s Potency as its successes.%0a%3c +1 Reach: Scripts can be set for automation, performing their task when some value is met, however it must be within the confines of what a computer understands. This is most often its time clock.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The caster can perform more complex tasks while controlling the object, including extended actions or maintaining continuous control of the object as long as the spell’s Duration lasts.%0a%3c %0a%3c Aethernet (Forces ••, Space ••)%0a%3c Practice: Ruling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Computer, Larceny, Persuasion%0a%3c Free WiFi is never truly free. It comes with its own risks and rewards and it is still, even today, not quite ubiquitous. Opening an ‘Aethernet’ connection allows a device which generates a signal (cellphone antenna, wifi adapter, RJ-45) to broadcast to a device which generates a similar signal (cell tower, wifi enabled router, ethernet cable) and receive those signals remotely using the natural sympathy of their wavelengths which is hardcoded to reality and the natural propensity for devices of these types to communicate.%0a%3c Add Death ••, Sprit ••, etc: By adding •• in an Arcanum whose purview includes another realm of existence (e.g. the Underworld or the Shadow), the mage may transmit data from that realm into the physical world, or vice versa.%0a%3c Add Time ••: By asserting that today is still yesterday, the character may access information that existed prior to entering an other worldly realm. This is most useful for accessing (deleted) digital libraries and not so much for email or news feeds.%0a%3c %0a%3c Inhibit Ignition (Forces ••)%0a%3c Practice: Ruling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Crafts, Science, Occult%0a%3c With this effect, the mage inhibits fire’s ability to spread to or to ignite new substances within it’s area of effect. While it will not extinguish existing flames, such a fire will die out naturally when its existing fuel is expended and it is unable to spread. %0a%3c More importantly, however, no new sources of ignition will work within the area. Matches or lighters will not light, nor will fuses. Explosives or their primers will not ignite, preventing bombs or grenades from exploding, and even bullets will not fire (note though, that projectiles NOT propelled by explosives will still work, for example Airsoft or CO2 guns). Vehicles operated by internal combustion engines will not run (but electric vehicles will!). %0a%3c If the source of fire or combustion is magical or supernatural in nature, this will provoke a Clash of Wills. %0a%3c %0a%3c Merciful Blow (Forces ••)%0a%3c Practice: Ruling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Brawl, Science%0a%3c Useful for both training purposes and for those who wish to subdue an opponent without causing permanent damage, the mage diffuses the force of his armed or hand to hand strikes, changing any lethal damage caused, into bashing. As usual, excessive bashing damage may roll over into lethal. This spell has no effect on INCOMING blows, only ones made by the mage himself.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The spell applies the Knocked Down Tilt%0a%3c +1 Reach: The spell applies the Stunned Tilt%0a%3c +2 Reach: The spell may be applied to thrown weapons. Alternately, it may be applied to Firearms, however they also automatically lose any Armor Piercing rating.%0a%3c Overclock (Forces ••)%0a%3c Practice: Ruling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Computer, Persuasion, Science%0a%3c Amplify the power, refine the language, complete the circuit; through subtle changes in the system, the target electronic device becomes increasingly receptive to the user’s input. The grants its user the 9-Again quality for the duration of the spell, so long as it’s a tool that can benefit from an increase in processing power.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The tool grants the 8-Again quality instead.%0a%3c %0a%3c Reroute (Forces ••)%0a%3c Practice: Ruling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Computer, Larceny, Subterfuge%0a%3c Data flows constantly, and with the correct nudge it can be made to flow to places other than its originally intended destination, as the case may be, packets will universally be resent to fill the void that was left when the receiving end fails to find the correct piece. A bank account number, the latest torrent streams, it all becomes accessible while in motion. Texts and emails are especially of great value as the cases may be. Only a single type of data may be affected.%0a%3c Alternatively, the mage can repel certain forms of data from a subject in a similar fashion; not getting that call, that text, that email can greatly disrupt normal business operations.%0a%3c +1 Reach: Additional types of data may be compelled to or from a subject, per level of reach.%0a%3c %0a%3c Flash Freeze (Forces •••)%0a%3c Practice: Fraying%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Intimidation, Occult, Survival%0a%3c The mage frays the heat of a subject, suddenly and dramatically dropping its temperature as though exposed to a snowy winter night. The effects of this vary by subject and circumstance. For example, most liquids and vapours condense/freeze, and most solid substances become brittle (ignore 1 Durability while frozen). If used on a living being, the spell causes Bashing damage equal to Potency for those incapable; if the spell is cast with sufficient Duration on a being capable of hibernation, it may be induced with this spell instead of damage.%0a%3c Note that this spell may cause further effects based on the being frozen, or being subjected to local temperature differences when the spell ends: sudden freezing may cause containers to burst, heated ice may crack, and condensed/frozen vapors may evaporate in high concentrations.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The sudden chill is enough to cause Bashing damage to all subjects. Those already susceptible to Bashing damage from the spell suffer a penalty to their Athletics equal to the spell’s Potency.%0a%3c %0a%3c In for a Shock (Forces 3, Life 3)%0a%3c Practice: Fraying%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Medicine, Science, Brawl%0a%3c With a touch, the Mage can harness and amplify the natural electrical impulses to create an electric shock within the subject. The subject takes the spell’s Potency in bashing damage as nerves misfire and electrical impulses are interrupted.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The sudden jolt causes the Stunned tilt due to its intensity.%0a%3c +1 Reach: Electrical devices in the target (Such as pacemakers) or touching the target’s skin also take the damage, bypassing Durability.%0a%3c %0a%3c Recompile Software (Forces •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Computer, Drive, Streetwise%0a%3c From 01000001 to 01011010, the digital sea ebbs and flows with software as it runs and performs its operations. Grasping deep within this network fueled by the genius of Tesla and Edison, born of Babbage and Turing, the mage may grasp and seize the children of Lovelace, forming them into new shapes to suit an immediate need. The Imago takes this need and realigns the 1s and 0s until they form the function that is required in that instant. What is a program: The chatbot, the firewall, the personal assistant. The MMO, the conversation, the Dialogue, the circle spins endless and takes limitless shapes. Humanity has yet to find the limit of what its software is capable of becoming. %0a%3c The potency of this effect reshapes the software, acting as successes to skill rolls performed by the software, if applicable. Each piece of software can only serve a single function, whether it be searching the internet, driving a car, or targetting an orbital strike.%0a%3c To code the software to the appropriate form, the mage must have an understanding of the code to be created, requiring a successful Intelligence + Computer check, penalized by the complexity of the new software. The ‘new’ software must still be operated by the user, which can be intensely frustrating when it no longer serves its original purpose.%0a%3c +1 Reach: Scripts can be set for automation, performing their task when some value is met, however it must be within the confines of what a computer understands. This is most often its time clock.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The caster can perform more complex tasks while controlling the object, including extended actions or maintaining continuous control of the object as long as the spell’s Duration lasts.%0a%3c %0a%3c Heat Shield (Forces •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested rote skills: Athletics, Occult, Science%0a%3c The mage redirects electrons, letting heat and electricity pass harmlessly around her. This spell acts as a shield against direct damage from fire and electricity, granting effective armour equal to the caster’s Forces Arcanum. It cannot stack with other sources of magical shields or armour. Mage Armour explicitly suppresses this spell when active, even if the protection should be less than the effect it replaces. Magical sources of harm trigger a Clash of Wills, and the spell can Clash as many times as the spell’s Potency. %0a%3c +1 Reach: Instead of the energy being harmlessly scattered, any damage prevented by the spell can be redirected to adjacent targets. Any targets within two meters not protected by this spell, including any attackers and the mage’s surroundings, suffer half the absorbed damage as bashing damage.%0a%3c %0a%3c Roll With It (Forces •••)%0a%3c Practice: Perfecting%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Cost: 1 Mana%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Science, Brawl%0a%3c The subject gains a superlative understanding of the application of kinetic force and leverage. The subject knows how to move to dissipate and redirect the energy from physical blows to reduce damage - possibly even avoiding what would otherwise be a solid strike, potentially setting up a counter-attack. This spell grants the subject’s attempt to dodge physical attacks, including attempts to grapple, the rote quality. The subject’s player can choose which of his rolls are affected (declared before the dice are rolled). This is used a number of rolls equal to potency while the spell duration is active. The subject of the spell is still subject to other dodge restrictions. %0a%3c +1 Reach: This spell applies to attempts to escape a grapple.%0a%3c +1 Reach, Add Time 1: The character may attempt to dodge bullets and similar attacks.%0a%3c %0a%3c Sound of Creation (Forces •••)%0a%3c Practices: Perfecting%0a%3c Primary factor: Potency%0a%3c Cost: 1 mana%0a%3c Suggested rote skills: Expression, Occult, Science%0a%3c Any action that has sound quality as a key component (i.e. musical performances) is heightened to magical perfection and acquires the rote quality. The subject gains the quality for a number of appropriate mundane rolls equal to Potency. While Forces are not commonly thought of as the source of inspiration, sonic energy holds mystical sway over living beings, and a master of this spell can use it to draw the perfected power of the Aether and use it to fuel and enhance her own gifts to exploit its many secrets.%0a%3c %0a%3c Compile Sprite (Forces ••••)%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Composure or Rank%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Computer, Expression, Occult%0a%3c Singularity. The Ghost in the Machine. SkyNet. Titan and Promethean. Replicants. Artificial Intelligence. We are software operating in the medium of a machine sculpted from a billion years of evolution and we now seek to create that which is ourselves within the digital medium, cause and effect, a summation of experiences, the methods go on for shaping these nascent disembodied beings though we inevitably seek to embody them that they might live among us in our world. Each level of Potency effectively grants a dot of the Retainer merit. The Sprite’s “Field” is defined at the time of its compilation, and must make sense for an AI in the system it’s implanted.%0a%3c Add Death ••••, Mind ••••, or Spirit ••••: Binds a ghost, goetia, or spirit into the Sprite, which allows it to act as a vessel for that entity. The sprite still uses the Retainer dots to determine dice pools, but it can use any of the possessing entity’s powers, and the sprite’s “field” is whatever the entity is capable of.%0a%3c Add Mind ••••: Binding a mind into the Sprite allows it to act a vessel for that consciousness. The sprite uses the dice pools of the mind’s owner in performing its tasks. While its mind is absent, the body remains unconscious and must be sustained through other means. If the body expires, the mind remains within the sprite until the end of its duration as normal and then passes to whatever fate it would normally achieve.%0a%3c %0a%3c Magnetic Freak (Forces 4)%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Science, Firearms By rewriting how magnetic objects react to the electromagnetic fields around them, the Mage becomes able to warp and control magnetic materials. This works with normal Scale factors , which define the number and size of the ferrous objects that can be manipulated. These targeted objects can be warped, moved through the air, mechanically reshaped, or otherwise manipulated in any manner appropriate to the strength of the electrical field; for the purposes of any related dice pools (such as attacks, jury-rigging, tearing apart an object, etc), use the spell’s Potency.%0a%3c %0a%3c Piercing Cold (Forces ••••)%0a%3c Practice: Unraveling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Intimidation, Occult, Survival%0a%3c This unraveling of the subject’s heat is an attack spell, inflicting lethal damage equal to its Potency. Against objects, ignore 2 points of Durability unless specifically built for such rapid temperature change. Appropriate liquids and vapours up to the affected Size/Scale are immediately frozen, often with catastrophic effects when subjected to the immediate heat around them. If cast with sufficient Scale, affected subjects already within appropriate liquids (e.g. arm in a full sink, swimming in a pool) may suffer appropriate Tilts, such as Pinned or Immobilized.%0a%3c +1 Reach: Ice thickens over one of the subject’s appendages, freezing it to a nearby surface and causing the Pinned Tilt (HL 143).%0a%3c +2 Reach: The cold creates an entrapping layer of ice over the subject, causing the Immobilized Tilt with Durability equal to half the caster’s Forces rating (rounded up).%0a%3c +1 Reach: For one point of Mana, the spell inflicts aggravated damage.%0a%3c %0a%3c Life Spells%0a%3c The Body Never Lies (Life •)%0a%3c Practice: Knowing/Unveiling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Animal Ken, Empathy, Subterfuge%0a%3c The human body communicates much more than words say. Gestures, natural expressions, unconscious verbal cues, muscle ticks, heartbeat, perspiration, pheromones.%0a%3c Potency is applied as bonus toward Empathy primarily Animal ken and Subterfuge to understand emotional states, lies, and basic intents, though physiological cues and anticipate active primal social instincts, as well as to detect mixed hidden truths.%0a%3c +1 Reach:’ Apply 9-again toward applicable understanding dice pools rolls only.%0a%3c Lesser Life Support (Life ••)%0a%3c Practice: Shielding%0a%3c Cost: 1 Mana%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c This spell is used to keep bodily fluids, individual organs, and substances made up of ‘living’ cells alive beyond normal expectancy outside of a body. For the duration the subject (which must be simple organisms, individual organs, bodily fluids of a more complex organism, or similar substances) are kept alive instead of degrading, from lack of nutrition, needed oxygen, carbon dioxide levels, and other storage factors, allowing cells to reconstitute themselves for the duration of the spell. This does not prevent the cells from ‘aging’ and dying, nor from being killed by more blatantly hostile conditions or violent injury (i.e it prevents no actual damage).%0a%3c This does not extend to complex organisms of any kind as a whole.%0a%3c Add Time ••: The subject substance does not ‘age’, ‘heal’, or grow for the duration of the spell.%0a%3c %0a%3c Carnal Perfection (Life •••)%0a%3c Practice: Perfecting%0a%3c Primeary factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Occult Athletics , Persuasion \\ By changing and rearranging hormones, pheromones, fat and muscle mass, the mage sculpts the subject’s body into the perfect representation of their sex. Add potency to all social rolls in which the body can play a part (similar to striking looks), up to a +5.%0a%3c +1 reach: For 1 mana, allow the bonus to go above +5. Note that this tends to be very obviously supernatural.%0a%3c +1 reach: Apply 8-again to a # of rolls equal to Potency.%0a%3c %0a%3c Living Defense (Life •••)%0a%3c Practice: Perfecting %0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration %0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Medicine, Weaponry%0a%3c By increasing the speed at which the brain transfers signals to the to the muscles that control quick reaction times, the subject is able to use their Dexterity for Defense calculation even if their Wits is lower.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Body Betrays (Life •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Resolve%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Science, Persuasion, Survival%0a%3c For all the vaunted supremacy of the human mind, there are some times that will is a slave to the meat. The Life practitioner exploits this fact, activataing glandular responses and neural impulses to force a subject to take a particular action; what Control Instincts suggests, this spell demands.%0a%3c The action must be able to be encapsulated in a single word, though actually speaking it is not necessary - flee, attack, sleep, sneeze. The action must also be driven by instinct and biology; the Mage could force a subject to scream but not to speak.%0a%3c The subject is compelled to carry out the action for the duration of the spell - in the case of sleep, the subject wakes naturally (i.e. if he is disturbed or their sleep otherwise disrupted). If the action becomes impossible to continue, though, the spell ends early (For instance, making someone vomit ends once their stomach contents are expelled). %0a%3c By default, this spell works only on mundane, living creatures. ‘Psychics’ and minor/half templates count as sufficiently mundane for this.%0a%3c +1 Reach: This spells affects living supernatural creatures normally. This cannot directly provoke a state like Death Rage, however.%0a%3c %0a%3c Matter Spells%0a%3c X-Ray Vision (Matter ••)%0a%3c Practice: Veiling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Crafts, Investigation, Science%0a%3c The subject of this spell is able to look through non-living objects as if they were not there. This does not extend the subject’s senses further than normal or give the subject the ability to see in darkness (without other magial means) but instead see as if non-living objects were not in there.%0a%3c For example the subject could look through a wall and see people in the next room, but could not see said people if there was no lights in the next room or if there were several living trees in the way.%0a%3c This allows the subject to cast sensory-range spells on targets the subject might not ordinary be able to perceive.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The subject can look partway through an object.For example: to see the face of a playing card by looking through the back of the card, or to look part way through a safe to see the tumblers, or to see that someone baked a file/bomb into a cake.%0a%3c Add Life 2: The subject can also see through living things.%0a%3c Add Forces 1: The subject can also see through forces which may block sight.%0a%3c %0a%3c Elixer/Charm (Matter •••/Prime ••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Cost: 1 Mana%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Science, Occult, Crafts%0a%3c Use of this spell allows the caster to temporarily place another spell that he can cast into a physical medium he crafts for later use. This medium can be a potion, unguent, powder, or any small object of size 1 or less, like a small stone or piece of jewelry. The caster must cast this spell to prepare the form, immediately followed by whatever spell he wishes to store, defining all spell factors and Reaches, paying any additional costs of the stored spell, and rolling for the spell, and Paradox if necessary, as normal. Attainments can not be stored this way. If the casting of the stored spell fails, the physical form of the Elixer/Charm is destroyed and the caster must start again. If successful, the spell does not take place at this time though, being stored in the physical medium. Any spell which is intended to affect a target other than the user of the medium is automatically a touch spell, or must be used as an Aimed Spell, the physical medium thrown, squirted or sprayed at the target with a Dex+Athletics roll, who gets their defense and may attempt to Dodge. If the stored spell has an area effect, it may be targetted at a location and effect anything within its range. The caster must define the method of use of the medium at the time of casting, if it is swallowed, rubbed or sprayed on, thrown at a target,crushed underfoot, etc. Regardless of the method, it requires an instant action, and the medium is destroyed in the process. Anyone who performs the activation, even accidentally, will trigger the stored spell. If the duration of the Elixer/Charm spell ends before the stored spell is triggered, the stored spell is lost without effect, but the medium is still destroyed. Both the Elixir spell and any stored spells count towards spell control normally, but may be Combined using the normal systems. %0a%3c In order to use this spell, the mage must incorporate a Sacrament Yantra into the casting, which counts against the normal Yantra limit. This becomes the physical form of the Elixer or Charm. This Sacrament must have an availability rating equal to or higher than the level of the spell the mage wishes to store in the item (if he wants to store a Forces 2 spell, the Sacrament must be Availability 2+). The mage may acquire this material at the normal Availability, or make it himself with the Build Mystic Equipment action (Wits+Occult), using the availability as the penalty to the roll. If that roll is successful, the total cost of components is reduced by 2, to a minimum of 0. (The mage wants a potion capable of storing a Life 3 effect. If he wants to acquire the needed item normally, it will have an Availability of 3. If he wants to make the potion from scratch, it would require a roll of Wits+Occult-3,and if successful, components with Availability 1). In addition, the Potency of the stored spell can’t exceed the the Potency of the Elixer/Charm spell itself (if the Elixer/Charm is cast with Potency 2, the maximum Potency of any spell stored in it is also 2).%0a%3c %0a%3c Extraction (Matter •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Durability%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Crafts, Medicine, Science%0a%3c The mage can separate any non-living material from another, causing it to sublimate, evaporate, or film as it separates.%0a%3c This does not breakdown existing chemical compounds, but may separate free ions in a substrate such as NA from NaCl dissolved within water, but won’t actively break molecules without additional application of other separate factors such as solvent, electricity, electromagnetic energy, enzymes, acids, bases or heat. This spell alone does not cause a physical barrier, and in liquids or gasses, will recombine as a normal reaction at end of duration. Removal of liquids from solids will pool on the surface and is easier to clean off until duration expires.%0a%3c With some substances, recombination may be more dangerous than direct spell use itself if not safely handled.%0a%3c +1 Reach: This spell may be able to cause speed reductions or possibly immobility upon complex devices if chemical power storage or lubricants are compromised.%0a%3c Add Life •••: The spell can affect living subjects to extract non supernatural poisons from a living bloodstream, so that it can be collected cohesively rather than just randomly purged from the system, or have to pass specifically though the kidneys. This could be popular with awakened smokers with tar lung, or removing poisoning that continues to harm after regular healing. This is withstood with Stamina if unwilling.%0a%3c %0a%3c Mind Spells%0a%3c Spirit Conversions%0a%3c The following Spirit spells can be assumed to have Mind-based equivalents at the same level that affect Goetia and similar Mind-related ephemeral entities instead of Spirits:%0a%3c %0a%3c Invoke Bane (Spirit 1)%0a%3c Know Spirit (Spirit 1)%0a%3c Command Spirit (Spirit 2)%0a%3c Shadow Walk (Spirit 2)%0a%3c Bolster Spirit (Spirit 3)%0a%3c Annihilate Spirit (Spirit 5)%0a%3c State of Mind (Mind ••)%0a%3c Practice: Ruling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Composure (only if resisted)%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Persuasion, Expression, Subterfuge%0a%3c The mage alters the subject’s basic mental flow, changing his subconscious and conscious thoughts and emotions to reflect any mental or emotional state the mage wishes.%0a%3c For each level of potency target receives one non-Persistent, mundane Condition. Said Conditions must be one created from the emotional/mental/perceptional state of the target(s), so Conditions such as Notoriety or Connected are not applicable, but conditions such as Deprived, Swooning, Spooked, Steadfast, Guilty, Leveraged, etc. are possible (these are just examples, not a complete list of possible Conditions). These Conditions can be positive or negative (or both).%0a%3c If the target resolves all the Condition before the Duration expires, the spell ends early.%0a%3c +2 Reach: The Conditions created can affect spell casting rolls.%0a%3c Devil’s Charm (Mind •••)%0a%3c Practice: Perfecting%0a%3c Primary factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Persuasion, Subterfuge, Socialize%0a%3c Maybe it’s the way he smiles, or the slight tilt in her hips as she walks. Whatever it might be the Mages Illusion causes those that see the subject to perceive them as the ideal individual, they see perfection personified as the eye plays tricks on the mind enamoring the subject.%0a%3c Add potency to all social rolls in which the Magi’s charm can play a part (similar to striking looks), up to a +5.%0a%3c +1 reach: For 1 mana, allow the bonus to go above +5. Note that this tends to be very obviously supernatural.%0a%3c +1 reach: Apply 8-again to a # of affected rolls equal to Potency.%0a%3c %0a%3c Higher Angels, Darker Demons (Mind •••)%0a%3c Practice: Perfecting%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Persuasion, Expression, Occult%0a%3c This spell grants the spell-caster EITHER the merit “Virtuous” OR the merit “Vice-Ridden” (see CoD corebook) which allows for either an extra Virtue or Vice (as applicable) to be applied for the duration of the spell. The extra slot is filled by one personality trait of the caster’s choosing, but the caster’s core personality (their original Virtue/Vice) cannot change. Willpower still may only be gained normally (Vice - once per scene, Virtue - twice per month), but their influence in Social Maneuvering count individually. This means it is possible for a tempting offer that satisfies both Vices makes it easier to manipulate a Mage under the Vice-Ridden merit’s effect, moving them two steps up the Social Maneuvering Impression chart OR an offer that acts in opposition to both Virtues adds two Doors to Social Maneuvering for a mage under the effects of the Virtuous merit.%0a%3c +2 Reach: The caster may benefit from BOTH the Virtuous and the Vice-Ridden merits. The second merit gains an additional trait that is defined at casting. (Default one extra in each)%0a%3c +1 Reach: For every level of Potency, the caster can add one Virtue/Vice (as appropriate) to a pool of traits to choose from. Each of these traits must be defined at spell-casting (and specified as a Virtue or a Vice if using the +2 Reach above). To switch from one trait to another requires a simple meditation roll (COMP+RES) taking several minutes of focused concentration. Again, core personality traits cannot be affected.%0a%3c +2 Reach: As above, however it takes one turn of focused concentration, rather than a meditation roll to switch personality traits.%0a%3c I’m Rubber, You’re Glue (Mind •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Empathy, Intimidation, Politics%0a%3c Based on a principle similar to the old children’s rhyme “I’m Rubber, You’re Glue, Whatever you say bounces off me and sticks to you”, this spell allows the subject to “bounce” back any attempts to Socially Maneuver him, with the result “sticking” to the person making the attempt. During the duration of the spell, the subject may reverse the effects of any Social Maneuvers or merits which would open Doors, up to a number of Doors equal to the potency of the spell, with the same “Goal” effects. %0a%3c The character attempting to open the subject’s doors declares their goal, methods, and makes any rolls as normal, but any doors that would be opened affect the character making the attempt rather than subject. The attacker’s Doors are determined as normal based on the Goal, their own Virtues, Vices, Aspirations, etc. The big bully trying to intimidate the subject suddenly realizes that the skinny guy actually is scary as hell, or the Femme Fatale attempting to seduce him discovers that she really IS “that into him”. %0a%3c If the Social Maneuver or merit is either supernatural in nature, or being bolstered supernaturally, this will provoke a Clash of Wills. %0a%3c +2 Reach: By spending 1 mana, the spell may be cast reflexively in response to a Social Maneuver or merit. %0a%3c +1 Reach: One ADDITIONAL Door is automatically opened. This Reach can be applied up to two times.%0a%3c %0a%3c Recollect (Mind •••)%0a%3c Practice: Perfecting%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Empathy, Medicine, Persuasion%0a%3c The mage reminds the subject’s dream body of what it was like when it was first formed. The mage can heal her subject’s dream body of injuries by collecting and reforming bits of the subject’s dream essence and reassembling the dream body as when the subject’s dream body was first formed.%0a%3c Each level of Potency heals two boxes of bashing damage of Dream Health.%0a%3c +1 Reach: Potency can be spent to recover 1 Lethal instead of 2 Bashing.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The mage may heal Personal Tilts on the subject’s dream body such as Arm Wrack, forcing broken bones back into shape on his dream form.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The spell reproduces the effects of a full night’s rest in the subject, including regaining a point of Willpower if applicable.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Quick and the Dead (Mind •••)%0a%3c Practice: Perfecting %0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration %0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Empathy, Expression%0a%3c By increasing the speed at which the neural pathways transfer signals to the rest of the body, the subject is able to use their Wits for Defense calculation even if their Dexterity is lower.%0a%3c %0a%3c Transfer Will (Mind •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Empathy, Persuasion, Medicine%0a%3c The mage effects a transaction between two individuals, the recipient and the donor, shifting a Willpower dot from the latter to the former.%0a%3c The recipient must have sacrificed a dot of Willpower to relinquish control of a spell or to contribute to some other magical working. The recipient regains the lost Willpower dot, and the donor loses a dot. The spell only works in the case of an entirely willing donor, who may not be in any way tricked or supernaturally influenced.%0a%3c +2 Reach: For 1 mana, the effect is Lasting%0a%3c %0a%3c I Know Crazy (Mind ••••)%0a%3c Practice: Perfecting%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency %0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Subterfuge, Expression %0a%3c The Mage taps into the subject’s cortex, copying and patterning their knowledge and muscle memory into their own mind or that of another subject (with appropriate Scale), allowing them to access one of the target’s Fighting styles at a rating equal to the lower of the subject’s rating or the spell’s potency, able to use it as if he had it himself.%0a%3c The subject must fulfill the requirements as usual since the spell only provides the knowledge and muscle memory for the merit, but doesn’t do anything to improve the capabilities of the subject.%0a%3c +1 Reach: For each Reach the Mage expands he may choose an additional Fighting Style known by a given subject, splitting Potency between them.%0a%3c %0a%3c Prime Spells%0a%3c Shield of Truth (Prime ••)%0a%3c Practice: Shielding%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Occult, Expression, Empathy%0a%3c By bolstering the truth of this spell’s subject, it defends against the falsehood of the Abyss. This spell protects the subject against the Numina, Influences, and Manifestations of Acamoths, Gulcamoths, and similar ephemeral Abyssal enttities. Any attempts to pierce the shield provokes a Clash of Wills.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The protection afforded by this spell extends to Abyssals’ physical attacks.%0a%3c Nimbus Inversion (Prime ••)%0a%3c Practice: Ruling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Withstand: Resolve%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Politics, Brawl, Socialize%0a%3c The Supernal burns out from every mage, leaking out into the world, marking the use of their power. By twisting the flow, the power flows not outwards but inwards, empowering or debilitating the mage as they themselves empower or debilitate the world and those around them; mechanically, the subject, who must be a mage, becomes affected by their own Nimbus Tilt. %0a%3c The seal placed upon the mage remains in place for the duration but the effects of the nimbus remains only for the duration it would normally last, thus a spell causing the nimbus to flare will cause the effect to impact the caster for a number of rounds equal to the potency of the effect.%0a%3c +2 Reach: The Nimbus remains in effect for the full remaining duration of the spell after it is triggered.%0a%3c %0a%3c Blaze of Glory (Prime •••)%0a%3c Practice: Perfecting%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Composure%0a%3c Cost: 1 Mana%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Politics, Persuasion, Intimidation%0a%3c This spell allows a mage to channel mana in order to enhance a supernal nimbus. For the Duration of the effect, the subjects’s Immediate Nimbus is treated as if his Gnosis has increased by the Potency of the spell. This only intensifies existing tilts (positives become more positive, negatives become more negative). If the subjects’s Immediate Nimbus normally causes multiple tilts (for example &#8722;1 Resolve, +1 Presence) the caster may choose how the additional effects are applied within the current tilts. In addition, the subject’s Immediate Nimbus is considered to be flaring for the duration of the spell, as if done purposely, and so is visible even to mundane perception. All normal effects and drawbacks of this still apply. This effect only affects subjects with a naturally occurring supernal nimbus.%0a%3c +2 Reach: The mage may apply a new tilt, or multiple new tilts, up to the total of that granted by the increased effective Gnosis. However, the subjects normal tilts still are in effect, and may conflict with or counteract applied ones. (IE, if the subject has a &#8722;1 Resolve tilt normally, and a +2 Resolve tilt is applies with this effect, it would have the total effect of having a +1 Resolve tilt.)%0a%3c %0a%3c Communion (Prime •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Withstand: Resolve%0a%3c Cost: 1+ Mana%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Computer, Occult, Socialize%0a%3c The greatest works of the Wise require every possible advantage in their creation and so with this magic an apprentice may assist their master with greater works rather than being a hindrance to the process. Those mages under the effects of the Communion, up to the spell’s potency, roll their Gnosis as a pool with each success reducing the penalties to the primary caster’s spell roll. This dice pool may not be modified by Willpower, magic, or other means. This burns a single mana from each participant. %0a%3c +2 Reach: The assisting mages may add their own Arcana to their Gnosis pool.%0a%3c %0a%3c Consume Passion (Prime •••/Fate ••)%0a%3c Practice: Perfecting%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Empathy, Expression, Occult%0a%3c This spell taps into the idyllic properties of a sufficiently ecstatic experience, absorbing a single point of Mana into the subject.%0a%3c %0a%3c These ecstatic expressions must be intense, emotionally charged, and mind-altering. Even raucous parties are not enough: only an expression iconic and powerful enough to shake the Fallen world, even for a moment, may be tapped into. Deep religious rituals, strong drug/insanity trips, live sacrifice, glossalalia, suspension, mutilation, witnessing a failed Breaking Point, and other experiences that produce an altered or disassociative mental state might apply. On the supernatural side, states of uncontrolled passion (Kuruth, frenzy, etc) can be used if the caster is daring enough to risk their time and presence. Emotionally intense supernatural acts (not casual/quick exchanges) ending with supernatural energies may also apply. For example, watching a hunt for fresh prey’s blood, glamour, or other energies that culminates in a dramatic feeding. Formal Oblations and other acts that already generate Mana may not apply, nor do states directly caused (not merely catalyzed) by magic: the energies and connections those actions tap into are already being used.%0a%3c %0a%3c A subject may not gain more total Mana from this spell in a day than the latest caster’s dots in Prime, and any Mana infused into a subject that cannot contain it naturally dissipates at the end of the spell’s Duration.%0a%3c %0a%3c Create Tass (Prime •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Cost: 1+ Mana%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Crafts, Occult, Expression%0a%3c The mage may channel Mana into a physical form, creating a piece of tass that represents an idealized Supernal form. The object created must be a simple object or tool no greater than Size 5 (food, swords, and gemstones are allowable, while guns and cars are not), and is obviously magical. The tass may appear menacing or intricate, but cannot perform tasks significantly; even high Durability item are too brittle to really cut or drive screws, for example. Any usage as a tool is considered to be improvised, and each action doing so expends 1 Mana from the tass. In addition, the tass has no explicit energy, nor it is subject to normal laws regarding its form. For example, tass food does not spoil, but neither does it nourish the eater, and the mage is advised not to increase the Durability of food beyond 1 if they expect it to be eaten.%0a%3c The tass has a default Durability of 1 and consists of one point of Mana (which the mage must pay as part of the casting). Potency may be allocated to increasing the Durability or Mana capacity on a one-for-one basis. When all Mana is withdrawn from the tass, it crumbles to nothing. A mage may “refill” the tass with the Channel Mana spell or similar effects. When the spell’s Duration runs out, any unused Mana sublimates back into the world and is lost.%0a%3c Add Forces 3: The object is not obviously magical.%0a%3c Add Life 2: Tass created as food/water is nourishing at the cost of expending 1 Mana.%0a%3c +2 Reach: The effect is Lasting (though the tass still crumbles if all its Mana is expended or absorbed.)%0a%3c %0a%3c Focused Aetheric Winds (Prime •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Expression, Occult%0a%3c The Mage calls forth a bare fraction of the howling fury of the Aether, blasting their subject with supernal winds. This is an attack spell, inflicting bashing damage equal to Potency.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The winds of the spell are focused on a particular point, inflicting the Arm Wrack or Leg Wrack tilt.%0a%3c +1 Reach: In lieu of damage, the mage may assign Potency to instead destroy the target’s Mana. One level of Potency so designed destroys one point of Mana, and Potency mzu be freely split between Mana destruction and damage.%0a%3c %0a%3c Forge Glamour (Prime •••)%0a%3c Practice: Perfecting%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Cost: 1+ Mana%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Larceny, Persuasion, Socialize%0a%3c As the Realm of Platonic Exemplars, the Supernal Realm of the Aether provides the essential nature of the worlds, this is seen most obviously in the constructs sculpted from raw mana which is the Thaumaturges right. More complicated are the esoteric ideas, the roles assumed by the Thespians, but these truths are no less than the Perfect Sword or the Perfect Hammer. Weaving a pattern of mana about their person, the Thespian draws down a piece of this perfected concept, assuming the role as it exists in its perfected state. This glamour suffuses them with props which serve their role and only their role, but these things remain insubstantial mere concepts to satisfy a need to present the correct postures. Potency may be allocated tot he following effects:%0a%3c %0a%3c A dice bonus akin to striking looks while engaging in the role portrayed.%0a%3c Increase Mana capacity by +1 (the mage may fill this Mana capacity by spending Mana as part of the casting or%0a%3c leave the object partially empty)%0a%3c %0a%3c +1 Reach: The Illusion of the Glamour may improve a Persona Yantra, splitting its potency towards perfecting it to a maximum of +4.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The Truth of the Illusion may be flared, burning a point of mana from its pattern to grant an 8-again to the dice roll.%0a%3c Add Forces 3: The illusion is not obviously magical.%0a%3c %0a%3c Not on My Watch (Prime •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Cost: 1 Mana%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Occult, Athletics, Persuasion%0a%3c For the duration of this spell, the Mage becomes better able to Counter certain spells, not just causing them to fizzle but launching them back at their caster. When targeted by a single-target, hostile spell, the Mage may use the Counterspell attainment with the requisite Arcana (NOT Universal Counterspell) to cause the spell to be reflected upon the caster instead of simply fizzling. The spell takes effect as if the original caster were the target, with other spell effects working normally. The spell may be dismissed normally still, but any lasting effects remain.%0a%3c +2 Reach: The caster may invoke this as a Reflexive Action for an additional Mana, allowing them to cast it while Counterspelling.%0a%3c %0a%3c Raising the Pillars (Prime •••)%0a%3c Practice: Perfecting%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Crafts, Persuasion, Science%0a%3c ”And the Druids turned to stone…” Libertines have a great affinity for the magic of humanity allowing them to use its practices to exemplify their own supernal magic through the presence of even sleepers. This spell allows a mage to reinforce the Supernal Truth of an Environmental Yantra composed of Sleepwalkers or a Techne Instrument composed of Sleepers increasing their collective bonus to the Potency of the spell, this remains limited by the normal rule that no Yantra may exceed a +5 bonus. A group can provide a bonus no higher than the number of its members.%0a%3c %0a%3c Supernal Eidolon (Prime •••)%0a%3c Practice: Perfecting%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Cost: 1+ Mana%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Occult, Expression or Academics%0a%3c The mage calls on her vision of a perfect magical tool for a spell she plans to work. She creates from Tass (see Platonic Form) the perfect tool for a specific spell. For each potency she achieves on Eidolon the tool provides a +1 Yantra bonus (remember a single Yantra can’t grant more than a +5 bonus) for a specific spell (which can be a Rote, Praxis or a regular spell) or increase it’s Mana capacity by 1. The spell must be from one of the mages ruling Arcana. As Platonic Form spell the Tass holds by default 1 Mana and 1 mana is drained from the Yantra each time it is used. The tool created by this spell is a simple representation of size 1 or 2 max and has 1 Durability.%0a%3c A Yantra can be made for another mage to use but it still follows all the same rules (ie: the yantra can only effect spells from the creator’s Ruling Arcana.)%0a%3c Note: Spell stacking rules apply; only the highest Potency Supernal Eidolon can be used for a given spell as a Yantra. +1 Reach: The tool is the perfect Yantra for all spells of a specific ruling Arcana the mage possesses%0a%3c +1 Reach: The tool encompasses an additional Ruling Arcana the mage possesses%0a%3c %0a%3c Witchlight (Prime •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Expression, Occult, Science%0a%3c The mage manifests a mote of the Aether’s raw revelatory energies, making light that is visible only to Active Mage Sight. It often appears as an orb of fire or electricity, but may look like anything unliving between the size of a walnut and a torch. Witchlights have substance, but are of negligible weight, able to be scooped up by hand. It provides no heat or force, and does not evoke special responses by appearance (e.g. frenzy or bans from fire); however, the appearance may still be shocking, or provoke responses related to light if it can be perceived. It may be held, positioned on a subject, or launched as an aimed spell like a flare. If a target wishes to resist a witchlight’s attachment to their Pattern, use Composure as a Withstand to make it simply slide off and continue with its natural momentum.%0a%3c A witchlight illuminates 10 yards per point of Potency clearly enough to make rolls without penalties for darkness, and twice that range at half the darkness penalty (rounded down). The light may be willfully dimmed, enhanced, or strobed to inflict the Poor Lighting Condition within its range of clear illumination.%0a%3c +1 Reach: Increase the witchlight to the size of a bonfire, doubling its range of illumination.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The light may be made visible to all supernatural entities, or even revealed fully into the Fallen world.%0a%3c +2 Reach and 1 Mana: The witchlight is Lasting, but cannot be fixed to a living target, burst, or change its level of illumination.%0a%3c %0a%3c Burden of Power (Prime 4)%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Withstand: Resolve%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Occult, Athletics, Persuasion%0a%3c Heavy is the burden of magic but heavier still, some would say, is the active weight of it upon its caster’s pattern. This spell transfers the burden of a spell from its caster’s pattern to a suitable pattern, whether it be another mage or a sympathetic sleepwalker.%0a%3c Reach +1: The spell may be transferred to an imbued item capable of casting the spell.%0a%3c Reach +2: Control of the spell is also relinquished to the recipient of the spell for its duration. This causes the Burden to be Lasting, but not the transferred spell’s duration which remains unchanged.%0a%3c %0a%3c Ecstasy (Prime ••••)%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Composure%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Empathy, Expression, Occult%0a%3c The spell inspires an overwhelmingly revelatory state of euphoria and/or terror in the subject, inspiring convulsions and other autonomic functions. It inflicts the Insensate Tilt for the Duration of the spell, or until the Tilt is resolved (for instance, by being attacked beyond this spell’s effects).%0a%3c +1 Reach: The subject receives a Supernal vision that offers great insight. The subject takes on the Humbled Tilt toward the caster (MtA 316), and likely has justification for life changes and Bluebooks.%0a%3c %0a%3c Imbued With Power (Prime 4)%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Withstand: Resolve (if resisted)%0a%3c Cost: 1 Mana%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Occult, Animal Ken or Subterfuge%0a%3c The spell allows a mage to imbued a Sleepwalker or another Mage with a small gift of their power. The mage casts the spell and ties it to the target’s pattern. The spell is only half formed allowing for some flexibility to the recipient to use.%0a%3c The target may cast the spell at anytime the caster could and makes all the decisions for the spell. The target can spend reach and uses the dice pool of the caster. However any mana that the spell needs or might use must be spent when Imbue With Power is cast unless the target has their own Mana to spend (The mage may place Mana with the Imbued With Power spell). It should be noted that the recipient cannot use Yantra’s with this spell or benefit from Ritual casting (although they still can to avoid spending Reach to make the spell Instant.)%0a%3c Imbue With Power has a drawback. Paradox is suffered by both the caster and target of the mage of any spell unleashed by Imbued With Power. While Paradox can be dealt with normally if the recipient is a Sleepwalker without Wisdom they cannot internalize it.%0a%3c The gifted spell can be used a number of times equal to this spell’s potency. The target of this spell cannot gain more potency of their gifted spell than Imbue With Power’s potency.%0a%3c +X Reach and 1 Mana - When casting Imbued With Power the mage may also include an Attainment that can be included with the spell. X is equal to the Attainment’s required Arcana level. This may only be an attainment that enhances or alters the spell directly; Temporal Sympathy could be added, for instance, but not Mage Armor.%0a%3c %0a%3c Lamina (Prime ••••)%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Stamina%0a%3c Cost: 1 Mana per subject%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Expression, Crafts, Occult%0a%3c The mage exudes and crystallizes a pelt of mana over the subject’s flesh, fusing a protective layer of tass to the mana that constitutes the subject’s pattern. Each level of Potency may be directed to 1 point of general or ballistic armor. Naturally, the subject glows like a lamp to anyone capable of sensing mana, and is unlikely to be able to explain their appearance to Sleepers.%0a%3c +1 Reach: Mana may be invested into the lamina to make it immune to the Armor Piercing effect for a turn. This may be invested during casting and held until use, or spent directly by the subject. Unused Mana is not destroyed when the spell ends, but sublimates into the world and likely returns to the nearest Hallow.%0a%3c +1 Reach, add Matter •••: The lamina becomes immune to the Armor Piercing effect.%0a%3c +1 Reach, add Forces or Matter ••(+): Features of the lamina (e.g. horns, spikes, fangs, etc.) act like natural weapons, with a lethal damage bonus equal to half the added Forces or Matter rating (choose only one), rounded up.%0a%3c %0a%3c Manipulate Pattern (Prime 4)%0a%3c Practice: Unravelling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Stamina%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Medicine, Larceny, Empathy%0a%3c Sacrifice is the most potent of magics. A mage may burn through his own life to replenish his magical reserves. Control of the Aetheric Wind allows them to go beyond the limits of their own pattern, reaching further and using those currents not as a blunt instructment but a precise tool with which they can begin to deconstruct the world into its most raw compontent part: Mana. Scouring or Restoring a pattern is the most basic practice a mage can perform, it is an essential quality to the awakened soul. This spell may restore a target’s pattern with mana or damage a pattern for mana using the normal conversion rates. Mages who possess Life’s Second Attainment: Improved Pattern Restoration may choose whether they wish to apply its effects to another living person when the spell is cast.%0a%3c Reach +1: An inanimate object (worth at least Availability 2) may be scoured or repaired. Most possess only a single point of mana but rare or priceless objects may contain more. Repairing requires a point of mana per point of structure. Scouring the last point of mana from an inanimate object causes it to crumble and dissipate into nothing.%0a%3c %0a%3c Power Words (Prime ••••/Fate ••••)%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Withstand: Resolve%0a%3c Cost: 1 Mana%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Academics, Occult, Expression%0a%3c High Speech is a conduit to the Realms Above, uniquely formed by the symbols the words entwine and their contextual intent for the Imago. A mixture of Patterning between Prime and Fate apply Supernal perfection to the subject’s High Speech, imbuing succinct words of power with the same symbolic value, intent, and determination as longer and/or repetitive mantras. As long as the subject may speak, High Speech may be used as a secondary reflexive yantra (MtA 119).%0a%3c +1 Reach: This extension of raw intent applies the subject’s unbridled articulations of magical symbolism to their High Speech. The yantra die bonus of using High Speech mantras (MtA 119) is substituted by the subject’s unaltered Occult rating (to a maximum of +5), even if this causes the character to receive a lower die bonus, or none at all. If used in this manner, High Speech may still be used as a reflexive Yantra, but loses its “secondary” quality (and thus cannot go over turn limits on yantra).%0a%3c %0a%3c Sanctuary (Prime 4)%0a%3c Practice: (Patterning)%0a%3c Cost: (1 Mana)%0a%3c Primary Factor: (Duration)%0a%3c Withstand: (Resolve) Optional%0a%3c %0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: (Academics,Occult, Empathy)%0a%3c For its duration, the caster may choose to grant the subject(s) of Sanctuary the effects of any Mage Armor the caster currently has in effect, at the appropriate level of effect. If the caster changes his Mage Armor, this change also effects the subjects of the Sanctuary. %0a%3c IE, the mage casts Sanctuary, using the Scale Factor to effect two targets. He then raises his Matter 3 Mage Armor for one mana. This would also grant both of the subjects of this spell 3 General Armor which ignores Armor Piercing. If the mage then spent a mana (and a reflexive action) to change to Life 3 Mage Armor, both subjects would lose the 3 General Armor (and the hardening against Armor Piercing), but gain 2 General Armor, and +2 Defense using the higher of (their OWN) wits or dexterity. %0a%3c If the subject of this spell is unwilling, he may withstand with Resolve, and if the subject is another mage, they may choose, at any time, to use their own Mage Armor instead of that granted by Sanctuary, at the normal cost to change Mage Armor (1 Mana and a Reflexive Action).\\ +1 Reach: The subjects and the caster of the Sanctuary may share the protection of any Mage Armor raised by any subject. IE, the mage cast Sanctuary on another Awakened. That mage has Time 4 Mage Armor in effect. The caster, and any other subjects of the Sanctuary spell, add +4 to their Defense, may use their Defense vs firearms, and if they succeed at a Dodge Action, they can reduce the attackers Initiative by 4 for the remainder of the scene by spending a mana (if they have any). If there are multiple mages as the subject of the Sanctuary, with different Mage Armors active, a subject may choose any of the active Mage Armors (or any they themselves possess), to be activated for 1 mana and a reflexive action.%0a%3c %0a%3c Sanctum Sanctorum (Prime ••••)%0a%3c Practice: (Perfecting)%0a%3c Primary Factor: (Potency)%0a%3c Withstand: Sanctum Rating (if any) Suggested Rote Skills: (Occult, Expression, Academics)%0a%3c With this spell, the caster may sanctify an area, causing it to act as a Sanctum or increasing the rating of an existing Sanctum, or defile an area or existing Sanctum, reducing it’s rating. If the area is currenly not a Sanctum, it becomes one with a rating equal to the spells potency. If it is a existing Sanctum, the rating is either raised or lowered by 1 (to a maximum of 5, or minimum of &#8722;5), withstood by the current Sanctum rating (absolute value). If an area has a negative Sanctum rating, it SUBTRACTS its value from Gnosis to determine spell control. %0a%3c +2 Reach: For 1 Mana, the effect is Lasting%0a%3c %0a%3c Squaring the Circle (Prime •••• OR optionally Prime ••• Mind ••••)%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Brawl, Expression, Occult%0a%3c An enhanced version of Display of Power, rather than merely providing a visible representation of a spell’s Imago, this rote projects a visible and audible representation of what the results would be if those Imagos were expressed in the Fallen World. This provides a more dynamic display that allows the mages involved to show off their personal styles, as well as makes witnessing the duel more interesting.%0a%3c The sensory effects provided by this spell are obviously illusory (visuals are translucent and sounds are distant and hollow), and will not fool anyone witnessing them that they are real.%0a%3c +2 Reach: For one Mana, any attempt to Counterspell (p. 192) a spell cast within the area gains the rote action quality, as the plainly visible Imago makes the spell easy to decipher. (In many duels, seconds are appointed to stand ready to Counterspell attempts at cheating.)%0a%3c %0a%3c Thaumaturgical Forge (Prime 4)%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Craft, Occult, Science%0a%3c Form follows function and when it comes to the processes of enchantment, patterns and symbols sympathetic to the nature of the enchantment provides clearer focus. Humans have known this for ages. Fire has power. Iron has power. The instruments of the awakened provide a focus to magic and with the right changes to their supernal resonance, a focus to enchantment. This spell empowers a single yantra per potency to be used during the process of Imbuing an item, providing its bonuses to the Gnosis + Prime pool of the Fourth Prime Attainment: Imbue Item. A mage remains limited in the number of yantras used by their gnosis. %0a%3c Tool Instruments must in some way be a part of the item being imbued. A cup, a coin, a staff, or some other Order style object, a material that resonates with the purpose of the spell included is another example. A sympathy included may be used to benefit from that sympathetic connection either as a bonus or as a necessary sympathetic connection in its use. An environmental yantra locks the item to that environment but a church is a church is a church, the symbols are the important part. A shadowname’s persona locks the item to the individual mage and those whose persona share a symbolism. It is common for masters and apprentices to share such symbolism.%0a%3c Reach +1: Yantras used in the creation of the object are applied as permanent bonuses to its casting total.%0a%3c %0a%3c Space Spells%0a%3c Nothing Between (Space •)%0a%3c Practice: Unveiling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Investigation, Science, Empathy%0a%3c If space is a lie, it must follow that distance is a lie. By means of this spell, the subject may see across vast distances as though she were immediately next to everything she sees. She could reading small print on the other side of the room or counting hairs on someone’s head as though they were right next to it.%0a%3c Multiply the distance at which the subject can see before suffering penalties by this spell’s Potency. Atmospheric conditions may impact this vision, as it effectively creates a telescope.%0a%3c +1 Reach: This spell allows the subject to see out to a number of miles equal the Mage’s dots in the Space Arcanum.%0a%3c +1 Reach: This spell applies to hearing as well as sight.%0a%3c +1 Reach: This spell can ignore intervening atmospheric conditions.%0a%3c Crossroads (Space ••)%0a%3c Practice: Ruling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Computers, Politics, Athletics%0a%3c How many roads must a man walk down, before you call him a man… Roads are but the connections between two points, moving along one is as simple as taking that first step. This spell allows the mage to step upon the beginning of an unobstructed conduit, corridor, path, road, track, trail, or tunnel and reach its terminus immediately or instead to step from one crossroads, junction, or node to the next. This requires that the ‘road’ is navigable. If it is not, the spell ends immediately at an physical obstruction that would prevent further travel, whether it be a door in a hallway, thick underbrush grown over a trail, a tree fallen over a path, or rush hour traffic if one is traveling via automobile.%0a%3c +1 Reach (Add Forces 2): The subject of the spell may use a virtual circuit, electrical conduit, or signal to define the path. This can be exceedingly difficult as many such paths travel unnavigable terrain in one form or another.%0a%3c +1 Reach (Add Prime 2): The subject of the spell may step from one node to the next along a leyline. This can be exceedingly difficult has many such paths traverse over the globe through physical objects.%0a%3c %0a%3c Spirit Spells%0a%3c Essence Conversion (Spirit/4)%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: None%0a%3c Cost: 1 Essence or 1 mana+Converted Essence or mana%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Occult, Science, Survival%0a%3c Bountiful but twisted super power storage of the Fallen world, Essence empowers abilities of spirits and ghosts drawn though nature and humanity in many forms. Patturning it’s energy, can be transfered to other forms of supernatural energy, but with some little efficiency loss.%0a%3c Often best applied in combined cast with Channel Essence, Works with essence held by caster or with freely available energy within area of effect. Choose one conversion function at a time.%0a%3c Essence can be altered and distilled to chosen singular form of Essence Resonance “flavor” or other following options that the mage has encountered previously.\\ Add Prime ••••: As a bonded familiar may do, A mage may Convert potency number of Essence to Mana, or Mana to Essence.%0a%3c Add Mind ••••: Essence Conversion Includes ability to Convert potency number of Essence to and From Ephemera utilized by Psychic Vampires\\ Add Fate ••••: As some Essence and Glamour share a common sources of Empatho-trophic energy. A mage may Convert potency number of Essence into Glamour, or Glamour into Essence.%0a%3c With Life ••••: a living fluid substance may be infused to produce a nutritionally viable substance for potent Kindred Vitae at a 1 essence to 1 vitae value. With Life •••• Matter ••••: a non living substance may be used.%0a%3c +2 Reach: The mage may “flavor” the Essence with multiple Resonances she has previously encountered.%0a%3c Time Spells%0a%3c Timekeeper (Time •)%0a%3c Practice: Unveiling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Withstand: None%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Drive, Empathy, Politics%0a%3c By use of this spell, the subject becomes aware of their absolute time, as well as the relative time between events. For instance, they could measure exactly how many seconds it takes for someone to run a lap without the use of a stopwatch. The subject not only detects when time has been sped up or slowed down, but they become aware of how much time “should” have passed.%0a%3c +1 Reach: By measuring the passage of moments, the subject may look upon a project that has been undertaken and know exactly when it’ll be complete. They could tell you exactly how long until a Kettle boils, the exact second a pregnant woman will give birth, or when a cathedral would be completed under present circumstances. Large scale projects that will be completed far in advance will return a likely range. When an Extended Action is evaluated, it returns how long it’ll take to complete on average and how long each interval is.%0a%3c Dusty Trails (Time ••)%0a%3c Practice: Veiling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Composure%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Investigation, Stealth, Subterfuge%0a%3c The subject appears completely distinct from one event in their past per Potency. Any mundane attempt to link them to their occluded past through physical or circumstantial evidence fails, and supernatural attempts to link the subject to their past provokes a Clash of Wills. This spell has no effect on memories. Without the aid of Temporal Sympathy, only events in the unchanged past may be occluded.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The subject is can not be tracked as their link to their own footsteps fades.%0a%3c Five O’Clock Shadow (Time ••)%0a%3c Practice: Veiling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: None%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Politics, Survival, Subterfuge%0a%3c This spell allows a Mage to alter the subject’s apparent age, or to make them rapidly progress or regress through time: someone could be made to appear older or younger; a seed could become a plant, or a plant could become a seed; a plant could be made to bear fruit or wither away as though it were winter; hair and nails could be lengthened and shortened; a kettle could be made to boil or cool. The changes brought on by this spell are illusionary, and some supernatural powers (including Time Mage Sight) may see through them with a successful Clash of Wills%0a%3c +1 Reach: This spell may cause the subject to detect as being from another time entirely, or to detect as moving faster or slower through time, or any other number of temporal anomolies with a Clash of Wills.%0a%3c Fog of Ages (Time ••)%0a%3c Practice: Veiling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Resolve%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Academics, Larceny, Subterfuge%0a%3c By means of this spell, an Apprentice of Time can hide the past from the subject. One consecutive Scene per Potency of the spell is obscured, meaning the subject can not remember it or acknowledge the results of it. +1 Reach: The scenes obscured by this spell no longer need to be consecutive. %0a%3c +1 Reach: Instead of obscuring entire scenes, this spell can obscure specific events within a scene while leaving the rest of the event unchanged.%0a%3c Procrastination (Time ••)%0a%3c Practice: Shielding%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: None%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Occult, Socialize, Survival%0a%3c Sure the subject might have just been hit by a truck or eaten by a grue, and yes a Disciple of Time has to deal with the fact that actually happened… but… they’ll get around to it later. This spell protects the subject’s pattern from being changed by what is going on in the present. Up to one Condition, Tilt, or instance of Damage may be suspended per point of Potency. When Damage is suspended, you only suspend a number of health levels equal to Potency. Directly supernatural changes require a Clash of Wills to suspend. When this spell’s duration wears off, all suspended events affect the subject instantly.%0a%3c +1 Reach: Once the spell ends, suspended effects happen at a rate of one per turn.%0a%3c Witnessed Postcognition (Time ••)%0a%3c Practice: Ruling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Academics, Empathy, Investigation%0a%3c Like the spell it is based on, Shared Postcongition allows a mage to propel a willing target’s senses back in time, though this acts as a breaking point for Sleepers. %0a%3c +1 Reach: The subject can “scrub” the vision like a video, speeding it up, slowing it down, rewinding it, pausing it, etc.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The subject remains aware of her surroundings, and does not lose Defense.%0a%3c %0a%3c Arcadian Hours (Time •••)%0a%3c Practice: Fraying%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Target Spell’s Caster’s Arcana Rating%0a%3c ‘Suggested Rote Skills: Occult, Drive or Persuasion%0a%3c The mage targets a spell causing it to be expended more quickly. If successful, this spell causes the targeted spell to elapse at a rate of (1 + Potency) times faster until this spell expires. This cannot reduce the duration beyond 1 remaining turn.%0a%3c %0a%3c Changing the Clock Face (Time •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Composure%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Academics, Stealth, Persuasion%0a%3c This spell allows a mage to cause the subject to rapidly progress or regress through time up to one year per Potency. Unlike Five O’Clock Shadow, these changes are real. However, they produce no mechanical benefit or hinderance, but they may have cosmetic and some narrative impact. For instance, someone made older by this spell would look and feel different, but they would have the same traits and they would live the same length of time after this spell.%0a%3c Long Day (Time •••)%0a%3c Practice: Fraying%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Stamina%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Academics, Socialize, Survival%0a%3c This spell makes the subject profoundly feel every moment they’ve been awake, even if they’ve just awoken. They gain the Lethargic Condition as though they have been awake for 1 hour per point of Potency and must make an immediate roll to stay awake. At the ST’s discretion, subjects who don’t feel fatigue may be immune to this spell.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The subject takes 1 Bashing Damage per point of Potency which can not be healed so long as the subject has the Lethargic condition.%0a%3c Lost Time (Time •••)%0a%3c Practice: Fraying%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Composure%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Academics, Socialize%0a%3c People get lost in the moment—they are having fun, or hard at work, and suddenly it’s a few hours later and they are left wondering where the time went? This spell allows the Mage to degrade the subject’s ability to change with the progression of time, inflicting the Insensate Tilt. If they were engaged in a reasonably inane task that requires little important decision making (such as reading, playing a game, watching TV, etc) they will continue to do it.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The subject becomes unaware of their surroundings for the duration of the spell.%0a%3c Sequel (Time •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Resolve%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Persuasion, Science, Survival%0a%3c With this spell, a Mage can force someone to relive past trials and victories. The subject gains one mundane, non-persistent Condition or Tilt per dot of the spell’s Potency that they have experienced in the past. The mage can select conditions they know about, or simply seek out conditions that match broad criteria (in which case the subject’s player chooses something appropriate). Without the Temporal Sympathy Attainment, this spell can only cause someone to to be affected by Conditions and Tilts experienced in the Unchanged past.%0a%3c +2 Reach: You may add a supernatural Condition or Tilt so long as you have another Arcana related to your choice rated at ••• or higher.%0a%3c Accelerate Metabolism (Time ••••)%0a%3c Practice: Perfecting%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Withstand: Stamina (If Resisted)%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Medicine or Science%0a%3c The spell accelerates the bodies natural healing process. Normally the domain of Shamans this spell still see’s use from desperate mages despite it’s drawbacks. For each potency of the spell the subject’s healing times are halved. The spell however puts enourmous strain on the subject which gains the Drained condition once they’ve been under this spell’s influence for a number of hours greater than the target’s Stamina. The condition is persistent until the spells end. Afterwards it can be cleared by eating enough food and getting some rest.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The subject’s accelerated metabolism helps them react faster granting +1 Initiative per Potency.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The mage spends 1 addtional Mana and subject(s) does not gain the Drained condition from this spell%0a%3c %0a%3c Co-Temperus (Time ••••)%0a%3c Mana Cost: 1%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Larceny, Politics, Subterfuge%0a%3c By making the present as indeterminable as the future, this spell can allow the subject to participate in multiple ‘potential presents’ simultaneously. The subject splits into one additional version of themselves per Potency. This is not a true division of the subject, but instead is the subject existing in multiple timelines. They share a single Willpower and Mana pool, but are otherwise treated as separate. At the beginning of the subject’s turn, each version of themselves may perform their actions as normal. However, apply the results of only one version of the subject on the world around them, and each version of the subject completely ignores what the others do (sometimes even occupying the same space). For instance, if one version of the subject opens a door and goes through it, all other versions of the subject still have to open the door and walk through it. If at the end of the turn the subject chooses to apply the changes of another version of themselves who did not open the door on the world, then the door would be closed at the end of the turn (having never been opened). Any supernatural powers that affect one or more versions of the subject affects all of them. When the spell ends or is canceled, only one version of the subject sticks around, and that version suffers all of the damage, conditions and tilts suffered by all other versions of themselves, but also gains all knowledge and experiences from the discarded versions of themselves.%0a%3c Add Mind (••): The different versions of the subject may communicate telepathically.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The different versions of the subject are more insulated from each other. When one or more of them is affected by a supernatural power, then they may roll a Clash of Wills to keep all other versions from themselves from being equally affected.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The version of the subject that remains after the spell expires gains the worst damage from all versions of themselves, instead of all of it.%0a%3c Note: A Space •••• equivalent of this spell exists, but relies on a duplication of the character’s spatial presence instead of timelines.%0a%3c %0a%3c Encore (Time ••••)%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Composure%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Expression, Science%0a%3c By means of this spell, the Mage can cause someone to repeat the actions of the past. Without the Temporal Sympathy attainment, the Mage chooses one instant action the subject performed in the unchanged past. The subject performs that same action on their next turn. They perform the same motions and thoughts they did, without regards to their surroundings. This makes interacting with a changing world imprecise (i.e. striking an opponent who has moved would cause them to strike at the same spot).%0a%3c +1 Reach: Instead of an instant action, the subject will repeat an entire Scene. This reach may be selected multiple times, causing the subject to repeat more than one scene’s worth of actions.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The subject will adjust their motions to try and produce the same result as their prior actions. Someone who read a book will pick up that same book to read if it is handy. Someone who threw a punch would throw a punch at the same target if they are nearby. If the subject can’t achieve the same result with only minor adjustments, they will mime the action normally.%0a%3c +3 Reach: As above, but the Mage may select new targets for the subject’s actions. The decision for what replaces the old target is made when the spell is cast, and that decision persists for the duration of the spell.%0a%3c Hung Action (Time ••••)%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Withstand: None%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Medicine, Subterfuge%0a%3c One mundane instant action performed by the subject while this spell is active becomes “hung” in time. Resolve the effects of the action then, but instead of performing that action the subject merely passes their turn. When this spell’s duration ends or it is canceled, the suspended action affects the world. Many mages use the the Fate •• attainment Conditional Duration on Hung Action, so it releases its action under set circumstances.%0a%3c Add Fate (••): Instead of suspending an action entirely, the Mage may suspend only their success. The suspended action appears to happen, yet it looks like a failure (or, at the subject’s option, a dramatic failure—this does not grant a beat). When the spell ends, it turns out the action was a success the entire time.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The subject may hang one additional mundane action while this spell is active.

They attempt to do something, only to have the actions play out in slow motion as they are witnesses to their own body. To them the world moves with sudden, great speed. The subject’s Speed and Defense are reduced to 0. They declare their action at the beginning of the round, but it only takes place at the end of the round (in the order of the Mage’s choosing in the case of multiple subjects). Everyone else’s action coints as interrupting their action.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The subject suffers the Immobilized Tilt as the slowing of Time becomes that much more all encompassing.%0a%3c Weave The Tapestry (Time ••••)%0a%3c Mana Cost: None%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Resolve%0a%3c A Mage may use this spell to guide the subject through multiple potential futures, ensuring that they pick what is best (or worst) for them. The Mage may cause the subject to reroll a number of mundane rolls equal to this spell’s potency. The mage chooses which rolls are rerolled, and whether to keep the old roll or use the new one. No dicepool may be rerolled more than once by this effect, even if another effect forces a reroll (in that case, you may perform a Clash of Wills to choose which roll to keep).%0a%3c +2 Reach: This spell may affect spellcasting rolls and supernatural rolls.%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c All Factions%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Directory: Mage the Awakening%0a%3c About the Venue	History	Society	Locations	Player Guide%0a%3c %0a%3c Portland, OR %0a%3c Districts%0a%3c %0a%3c Changeling %0a%3c Player Guide%0a%3c %0a%3c Mage %0a%3c Player Guide%0a%3c %0a%3c Mortal %0a%3c Player Guide%0a%3c %0a%3c Vampire %0a%3c Player Guide%0a%3c %0a%3c Werewolf %0a%3c Player Guide%0a%3c Edit - History - Print - Recent Changes - Search%0a%3c Page last modified on August 07, 2017, at 05:34 PM%0a%3c The Storytelling System, Beast the Primordial, Changeling the Lost, Chronicles of Darkness, Demon the Descent, Mage the Awakening, Vampire the Requiem, and Werewolf the Forsaken ©2014-2016 CCP hf and published by Onyx Path Publishing.%0a%3c Produced by Jeff Vandenberg.
