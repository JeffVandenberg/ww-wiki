Lots of jewelry. That’s the first thing noticed about Penny. She wears enough necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and rings to feed a small village. Usually you can hear her coming before you see her. Upon closer inspection though, this jewelry is of the costume variety and wouldn’t fetch more than $20 or so on Ebay. Her long brown hair is usually done in twists and either hanging free or tied in a ponytail. Her attire varies from dirty jeans and a stained t-shirt when working on her bike to flowy skirts and shirts even a dress or two. She can often be found talking to herself but those that can see through the veil can see she is talking to a raven spirit\\%0a%0a!!!%25werewolf%25The True Self\\%0a%0aA medium sized wolf with a mix of white and various browns making up the colors of her fur coat. Amber colored eyes with an inquisitive look, or is it mischief? Generally relaxed unless on the prowl or if she sense danger. %0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=17px margin-right=16px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=8px width=315 newwin%25https://assets.rbl.ms/7960850/980x.jpg\\%0a%0a%0a%25center%25%25newwin%25https://i.imgur.com/JU06MIm.png\\%0a%0aPenny errs on the peaceful side for a wolf. She can throwdown of she has to but the Ithaeur would rather use her words. She is carefree and always up to putting in her 2 cents. Even when it isn’t asked for. Some call her naive, she calls it being optimistic. Penny always tries to see the bright side of a situation. She also trusts a little too easily which can get her in trouble.\\%0a%0a%25center%25%25newwin%25https://i.imgur.com/VARw7Cl.png\\%0a%0aPenny was adopted at the age of 3, taken in by a biker family in Texas. She first changed at 18 and took off, never looking back. Afraid to kill anymore people she loved or even of them killing her. A year later she was picked up by a nomadic pack called the Midnight Angels and ran with them for 10 years until coming to Portland, hearing she had blood family here. For those who care to inquire she will proudly state that she's a Westbay. \\%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25center%25%25newwin%25https://i.imgur.com/ed9P3d5.png\\%0a%0a|| %25thumb%25[[https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/d31dcbfb20902f8c0539775f6ad5154f/5C53CBF7/t51.2885-15/e35/41885922_354693421740694_8815737481235830743_n.jpg|https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/d31dcbfb20902f8c0539775f6ad5154f/5C53CBF7/t51.2885-15/e35/41885922_354693421740694_8815737481235830743_n.jpg]] || %25thumb%25[[https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/5a13e8477dfc4ffeb30453505ff2dc8f/5C53C473/t51.2885-15/e35/39039545_2228234027405461_6581436936102084608_n.jpg|https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/5a13e8477dfc4ffeb30453505ff2dc8f/5C53C473/t51.2885-15/e35/39039545_2228234027405461_6581436936102084608_n.jpg]] || %25thumb%25[[https://spinmodelmanagement.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Erika18.jpg|https://spinmodelmanagement.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Erika18.jpg]] || %25thumb%25[[https://i.pinimg.com/originals/30/1f/47/301f475c0a0441e548fb03438c70905d.jpg|https://i.pinimg.com/originals/30/1f/47/301f475c0a0441e548fb03438c70905d.jpg]] || %25thumb%25[[https://mediaslide-europe.storage.googleapis.com/metromodels/pictures/122/496/large-1519299736-7971aea845efa16637a31a4ee160ba02.jpg|https://mediaslide-europe.storage.googleapis.com/metromodels/pictures/122/496/large-1519299736-7971aea845efa16637a31a4ee160ba02.jpg]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25[[https://images.fashionmodeldirectory.com/model/000000313334-erika_labanauskaite-squaremedium.jpg|https://images.fashionmodeldirectory.com/model/000000313334-erika_labanauskaite-squaremedium.jpg]] || %25thumb%25[[https://scriptical.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/tumblr_lueki1qj251qfz1mf.jpg|https://scriptical.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/tumblr_lueki1qj251qfz1mf.jpg]] || %25thumb%25[[https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png|https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png]] || %25thumb%25[[https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png|https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png]] || %25thumb%25[[https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png|https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25[[https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png|https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png]] || %25thumb%25[[https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png|https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png]] || %25thumb%25[[https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png|https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png]] || %25thumb%25[[https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png|https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png]] || %25thumb%25[[https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png|https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png]] ||%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25center%25%25newwin%25https://i.imgur.com/PkBlgBq.png\\%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=17px margin-right=16px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=8px width=315 newwin%25https://i.pinimg.com/564x/67/3a/7f/673a7f4fd735aff0b6482cfc47d05437.jpg\\%0a%0a!!!%25werewolf%25A Stitch In Time\\%0a%0aNot a doctor. No proper medical training. However, when you ride with wolves and with bikers wounds are bound to happen that might need a little help. She knows quite a bit about rudimentary patch jobs as well as herbal and holistic medicine.%0a%0a!!!%25werewolf%25With Hands Like These\\%0a%0aWhile not a 5-star artist, Penny enjoys sculpting and molding various materials with the use of her gifts. Anything from steel to wood, if you want something crafted - she might be able to help out. She is also a fairly decent mechanic. Depending on what it is and why you need it she might even do it for free or a favor instead of cold hard cash.%0a%0a!!!%25werewolf%25Her Name Is Lola\\%0a%0aPenny loves her motorcycle. In fact, she enjoys cars in general, working on them and tinkering and such, but motorcycles are a passion. Her Harley-Davidson is named Lola. You can look, but you have to be pretty special if you are allowed to touch.%0a%0a!!!%25werewolf%25Did You Hear That?\\%0a%0aAs an Ithaeur, Penny has a very deep connection with the spirits of this world. Even if they aren’t her biggest fan, she is fascinated by them. A raven spirit of curiosity named Nevermore attached itself to her about a year after her first change. He is probably partially to blame for this fascination but she doesn’t see a problem with it.%0a%0a!!!%25werewolf%25Dust In The Wind\\%0a%0aPenny traveled for 8 years with a nomadic pack/biker gang, The Midnight Angels, before coming here to Portland. Maybe you met her on the road? Maybe you’ve heard of the pack or the gang.

Lots of jewelry. That’s the first thing noticed about Penny. She wears enough necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and rings to feed a small village. Usually you can hear her coming before you see her. Upon closer inspection though, this jewelry is of the costume variety and wouldn’t fetch more than $20 or so on Ebay. Her long brown hair is usually done in twists and either hanging free or tied in a ponytail. Her attire varies from dirty jeans and a stained t-shirt when working on her bike to flowy skirts and shirts even a dress or two. She can often be found talking to herself but those that can see through the veil can see she is talking to a raven spirit\\%0a%3c %0a%3c %25werewolf%25 The True Self\\%0a%3c %0a%3c A medium sized wolf with a mix of white and various browns making up the colors of her fur coat. Amber colored eyes with an inquisitive look, or is it mischief? Generally relaxed unless on the prowl or if she sense danger. %0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=17px margin-right=16px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=8px width=315 newwin%25https://assets.rbl.ms/7960850/980x.jpg\\%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !%25werewolf%25 Personality:\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Penny errs on the peaceful side for a wolf. She can throwdown of she has to but the Ithaeur would rather use her words. She is carefree and always up to putting in her 2 cents. Even when it isn’t asked for. Some call her naive, she calls it being optimistic. Penny always tries to see the bright side of a situation. She also trusts a little too easily which can get her in trouble.\\%0a%3c %0a%3c !%25werewolf%25 History:\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Penny was adopted at the age of 3, taken in by a biker family in Texas. She first changed at 18 and took off, never looking back. Afraid to kill anymore people she loved or even of them killing her. A year later she was picked up by a nomadic pack called the Midnight Angels and ran with them for 10 years until coming to Portland, hearing she had blood family here. For those who care to inquire she will proudly state that she's a Westbay. \\%0a%3c %0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c !%25werewolf%25  Hooks:%0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=17px margin-right=16px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=8px width=315 newwin%25https://i.pinimg.com/564x/67/3a/7f/673a7f4fd735aff0b6482cfc47d05437.jpg\\%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Her Name Is Lola - Penny loves her motorcycle. In fact, she enjoys cars in general, working on them and tinkering and such, but motorcycles are a passion. Her Harley-Davidson is named Lola. You can look, but you have to be pretty special if you are allowed to touch.%0a%3c %0a%3c Did You Hear That? - As an Ithaeur, Penny has a very deep connection with the spirits of this world. Even if they aren’t her biggest fan, she is fascinated by them. A raven spirit of curiosity named Nevermore attached itself to her about a year after her first change. He is probably partially to blame for this fascination but she doesn’t see a problem with it.%0a%3c %0a%3c Dust In The Wind - Penny traveled for 8 years with a nomadic pack/biker gang, The Midnight Angels, before coming here to Portland. Maybe you met her on the road? Maybe you’ve heard of the pack or the gang. Anything’s possible in this crazy world.%0a%3c %0a%3c When in Need - Spirit's talk, and their talk has brought Penny back to Portland. With news of Charlie's death, she knew it was time to come back to Portland so she could help be a support for her family. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Fool, The Moon, The King - Penny was introduce to Wicca by a mortal in the Midnight Angels, along with fortune telling and the like. She enjoys both immensely and is always up for doing a reading for people. Ask her anything, she’ll find you an answer.%0a%3c %0a%3c With Hands Like These - While not a 5-star artist, Penny enjoys sculpting and molding various materials with the use of her gifts. Anything from steel to wood, if you want something crafted - she might be able to help out. She is also a fairly decent mechanic. Depending on what it is and why you need it she might even do it for free or a favor instead of cold hard cash.%0a%3c %0a%3c A Stitch In Time - Not a doctor. No proper medical training. However, when you ride with wolves and with bikers wounds are bound to happen that might need a little help. She knows quite a bit about rudimentary patch jobs as well as herbal and holistic medicine.%0a%3c %0a%3c \\%0a%3c %0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !%25werewolf%25 My Family%0a%3c (:cellnr width=50%25 align=left style='padding-left: 10px;':)%0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=4px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=0px width=100%25 https://i1.wp.com/www.tv-eh.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/KHR.jpg%0a%3c %25werewolf%25 '''[[Samuel Caine|%25color=663300%25Sammy]]''' \\%0a%3c %0a%3c "This man means the world to me.
