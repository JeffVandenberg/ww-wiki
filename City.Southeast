This area was the first section of Miami Beach to be developed, starting in the 1910s, due to the development efforts of Carl G. Fisher, the Lummus Brothers, and John S. Collins, the latter of whose construction of the Collins Bridge provided the first vital land link between mainland Miami and the beaches.%0aThe area has gone through numerous artificial and natural changes over the years, including a booming regional economy, increased tourism, and the 1926 hurricane, which destroyed much of the area.%0aIn both daytime and at nightfall, the South Beach section of Miami Beach is a major entertainment destination with hundreds of nightclubs, restaurants, boutiques and hotels. The area is popular with tourists from Canada, Europe, Israel and the entire Western Hemisphere, with some having permanent or second homes there. South Beach has also been visited by many American and foreign tourists, evidenced by the fact that the practice of topless sunbathing by women on the beach and in a few hotel pools on Miami Beach has been considered by the local citizens as being more permissive than on most beaches of the United States, and despite the fact that the practice has not been officially legalized by the local government, it continues to be adopted in large scale.%0aSouth Beach's residents' varied backgrounds are evident in the many languages spoken.  Another unique aesthetic attribute of South Beach is the presence of several colorful and unique stands used by Miami Beach's lifeguards on South Beach. After Hurricane Andrew, Architect William Lane donated his design services to the city and added new stops on design tours in the form of lifeguard towers. His towers instantly became symbols of the revived City of Miami Beach.%0aSouth Beach is considered a hub of LGBT lifestyle. In the 80s and 90s South beach was the center of Florida's gay life and nightlife. It is home to many hotels, clubs, and nightlife that caters to the LGBT community. Ocean Drive is a hotspot to socialize and there is LGBT friendly shopping and cocktailing on Lincoln Road. The World Erotic Art Museum on South Beach is considered a local favorite to visit.%0aSouth Beach is also the location of the Pride Parade and Pride Festival events during Pride Week of the annual Miami Beach Pride celebration. Both of the events run through Ocean Drive from Fifth to 15th Streets. First started in 2009, Miami Beach Pride now draws over 130,000 people to South Beach every year.%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*[[Ocean Drive]]%0a*[[Miami Beach]]%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Venetian Island''%0a%0aThe Venetian Islands are a chain of artificial islands in Biscayne Bay in the cities of Miami and Miami Beach, Florida. The islands are, from west to east: Biscayne Island (Miami), San Marco Island (Miami), San Marino Island (Miami Beach), Di Lido Island (Miami Beach), Rivo Alto Island (Miami Beach), and Belle Isle (Miami Beach). Flagler Monument Island remains an uninhabited picnic island, originally built in 1920 as a memorial to railroad pioneer Henry Flagler. The islands are connected by bridges from the Miami mainland to Miami Beach.%0aThe Venetian Islands project was proposed to be much larger than what exists today. Another causeway was to be built, called "The Drive of the Campanili." The causeway would connect Hibiscus Island (south of the Venetian Islands) with Di Lido Island. The road would then continue north right up the center of Biscayne Bay, with five new islands created along its path. The roadway would then veer slightly to the northeast, where it would end at Indian Creek Village. An additional four islands would be built along two east-west roads that would connect with the causeway. One of these roads was along the current route of the Julia Tuttle Causeway and the other along the current route of the 79th Street Causeway.%0aThe original bridge (called the Collins Bridge) was built by farmer and developer John S. Collins with financial assistance from automotive parts and racing pioneer Carl G. Fisher. At the time it was completed, it was the longest wooden bridge in the world. The 2½ mile wooden toll bridge opened on June 12, 1913, providing a critical link to the newly established city of Miami Beach, formerly accessible only by a ferry service.%0aWhile none of these islands were built, the foundation pilings for one of them can still be seen in Central Biscayne Bay between Di Lido Island and the Julia Tuttle Causeway. The island was to be called Isola di Lolando.[2] The demise of the island construction was due to a combination of the aftermath of the 1926 Miami Hurricane and the end of the Florida land boom of the 1920s. The Shoreland Company went bankrupt in 1927 due to objections of "further mutilation of the waterway".%0aThe original wooden causeway was replaced in 1925 by a series of arch drawbridges and renamed the Venetian Causeway. Today, the causeway is a popular stretch for people to jog, ride bikes, walk dogs and stroll. The islands offer residents a suburb feel that is located between (and within minutes of) Miami Beach's South Beach and Miami's new Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts.%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Watson Island''%25%25%0a%0aLiving in Watson Island offers residents a rural feel.  The island was deeded to the city in 1919 with the restriction that it only be used for public or municipal purposes. The city gave it to the state and the state deeded it back to the city with similar restrictions - both in the 1940s. In 1979 the city attempted to circumvent this prohibition by claiming that the underwater land surrounding the island is a preserve and Watson Island need not be protected as per the deed, as a park, or for public ownership and use.%0a%0aThe island had a name change from Causeway Island to Watson Island, named for John W. Watson, Sr., who was Mayor of Miami 1912-1915 and 1917-1919. In 1932 Watson Island was considered for the site of Miami's Pan-American Exposition, a World's Fair and "International Merchandise mart." By the end of the 1940s, however, the site of the Exposition, now called Interama, was moved North to where Oleta River State Park is today.%0aA Goodyear Blimp base was located on Watson Island from 1930 to 1978, initially on the east side of the island and later on a new landfill area to the west. Goodyear moved the base to Opa-locka Airport after failing to agree on lease renewal terms with the city. Vestiges of the old base still remain such as the imprint of the mooring circle and a paved path for a small tram that would transport passengers to the airship.%0aGrand plans to develop the island started in 1979, with a planned amusement park, Diplomat World. Residents formed "Save Watson Island, Inc", a neighborhood group opposing the use for anything other than a park. They had public demonstrations and because of the demonstrations and a variety of other reasons, the amusement park was never built%0aAnother development included one from the late 1990s, culminating in 2003 when Jungle Island relocated to Watson. There has been continued controversy stemming from Jungle Island's inability to meet the financing terms it had made with the local municipalities when the move was approved. Local elected officials had and continue to bail out Jungle Island with tax dollars. The Miami Children's Museum also relocated to the island, in 2004. The State of Florida offered a site in the Island Gardens project on Watson Island to host the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) Permanent Secretariat.[4] As of March 2006 the Florida Department of Transportation was planning to construct a tunnel from the Port of Miami on Dodge Island under the main shipping channel to the MacArthur Causeway on Watson Island. On May 24, 2010, construction began on the Port of Miami Tunnel; it was completed on August 3, 2014%0aAviation Center - Chalk's International Airlines maintained a seaplane base on Watson Island from 1926 until it ceased operation in 2007. As of 2006, the City of Miami is relocating the Miami Heliport to a site adjacent to Chalk's seaplane base, with the intention of creating an Aviation Center serving corporate and tourism needs.%0aThe Ichimura Miami - Japanese Garden grew out of the efforts of Kiyoshi Ichimura, who sent objects, materials and artisans from Tokyo to Miami in the 1950s to construct the San-Ai-An Japanese Garden on Watson Island. The garden opened in 1961. As of 2006, the garden was being redesigned and reconstructed.%0aJungle Island - Jungle Island opened its new facility on Watson Island in 2003. Originally named Parrot Jungle, the popular tourist attraction first opened in the Pinecrest neighborhood of Miami in 1936. Over the years, the attraction came to be a popular attraction for Miami residents and tourists, but that trend reversed once it moved to the smaller and less natural setting of Watson Island. Jungle Island has many fewer animals, and none of the old growth vegetation the original park was known for. Jungle Island hosts Miami's most popular event venue with its Treetop Ballroom.%0aMiami Children's Museum - The Miami Children's Museum opened a new 56,500-square-foot (5,250 m2) facility on Watson Island in 2003. It has ten galleries, classrooms, birthday party rooms, a parent/teacher resource center, an educational gift shop, a 200-seat auditorium and a dining area.%0aMiami Outboard Club - The Miami Outboard Club has been located on Watson Island since 1948. It is active in conservation and artificial reef programs, and provides social and educational activities. The club has boat slips, dry storage, a boat lift, a ramp for jet skis and other small craft, and a restaurant, bar and an internet cafe.%0aMiami Yacht Club - The Miami Yacht Club has been located on Watson Island since the late 1940s. It offers youth and adult sailing programs, and sponsors races, regattas and a Sea Scout ship. The club has boat slips, dry storage, and a lounge, bar and restaurant.%0aPublic Boat Ramp - There is a Public Boat Ramp with 50 oversized parking spaces for vehicles with boat trailers.%0a%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' ••••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Dodge Island''%0a%0aDodge Island is an artificial island near downtown Miami, Florida, United States. The Port of Miami is located on Dodge Island and has berths for both cruise and cargo ships.%0aThe original and much smaller Dodge Island was created during the dredging of Government Cut in the early 1900s. According to The Miami News, the island went unnamed until 1950 when Mr and Mrs Ray Dodge of Wisconsin, friends of Frank Stearns, director of the City of Miami Planning Board, were visiting and asked what the island was called and, "unable to come up with a name of the island ... Stearns gave the parcel of land its present name." The current island was formed by further filling which combined Dodge Island with two other man-made islands, Lummus Island and Sam's Island.%0a%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' ••••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Fisher Island''%0a%0aFisher Island is in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States, located on a barrier island of the same name. As of 2015, Fisher Island had the highest per capita income of any place in the United States. The CDP had only 218 households and a total population of 467.%0aNamed for automotive parts pioneer and beach real estate developer Carl G. Fisher, who once owned it, Fisher Island is three miles off shore of mainland South Florida. No road or causeway connects to the island, which is accessible by private boat, helicopter, or ferry. Once a one-family island home of the Vanderbilts, and later several other millionaires, it was sold for development in the 1960s. The property sat vacant for well over 15 years before development was begun for very limited and restrictive multi-family use. The island was created in 1905 by a dredging and land reclamation projects in and around Miami Beach. Construction of Fisher Island began in 1919 when Carl G. Fisher, a land developer, purchased the property from businessmen and real estate developer Dana A. Dorsey, southern Florida's first African-American millionaire. In 1925 William Kissam Vanderbilt II traded a luxury yacht to Fisher for ownership of the island.%0aAfter Vanderbilt's death in 1944, the ownership of the island passed to U.S. Steel heir Edward Moore. Moore died in the early 1950s, and Gar Wood, the millionaire inventor of hydraulic construction equipment, bought it. Wood, a speedboat enthusiast, kept the island a one-family retreat. In 1963, Wood sold to a development group that included local Key Biscayne millionaire Bebe Rebozo, a Miami native and United States Senator George Smathers and then former U.S. Vice President Richard Nixon, who had promised to leave politics. During his subsequent presidency from 1968–1973, and during the Watergate scandal, Nixon maintained a home on nearby Key Biscayne known as the "Key Biscayne Whitehouse" that was the former residence of Senator Smathers and next door to Rebozo, but none of the three ever resided on Fisher Island.%0aThe Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS) of the University of Miami maintained the Comparative Sedimentology Laboratory on Fisher Island from 1972 to 1990 under the leadership of Robert Ginsburg.%0aAfter years of legal battles and changes in ownership, further development on the island was finally started in the 1980s, with architecture matching the original 1920s Spanish style mansions. Although no longer a one-family island, in 2005, Fisher Island still remains somewhat inaccessible to the public and uninvited guests, and is as exclusive by modern standards as it was in the days of the Vanderbilts, providing similar refuge and retreat for its residents. The island contains mansions, a hotel, several apartment buildings, an observatory, and a private marina. Boris Becker, Oprah Winfrey, and Mel Brooks are among the celebrities with homes on the island.  In 2005, the island attempted to incorporate as a town, but the Miami-Dade County Commission did not support this initiative.%0a%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Virginia Key''%0a%0aWhat is now Virginia Key was the southern end of a barrier island that extended from the New River inlet in Fort Lauderdale to just north of Key Biscayne. Early accounts by Spanish explorers indicated the existence of one or more inlets somewhere on the long spit of land enclosing the northern end of Biscayne Bay, but such inlets open and close over time. At the beginning of the 19th century, there was no inlet through the barrier island between the New River Inlet and Bear Cut, at the northern end of Key Biscayne. Hurricanes in 1835 and 1838 opened a new inlet, Narrows Cut (now known as Norris Cut), separating Virginia Key from what is now Fisher Island at the south end of Miami Beach.%0aThe island was named by Frederick H. Gerdes of the United States Coast Survey in 1849. He noted that the island north of Key Biscayne had no name, and had not existed as an island until 'Narrows Cut' had broken through "ten or twelve" years before (i.e., the hurricane of 1835 or 1838). He described Virginia Key as three miles (5 km) long and one mile (1.6 km) wide (later, as five miles (8 km) long and one-and-a-half miles wide), with a fine Atlantic beach, but mostly covered with mangroves.  Scenes from the 1994 comedy film Ace Ventura: Pet Detective were shot here.In May 1945, seven civil rights activists supported by the local NAACP chapter staged a "wade-in" at the whites’ only Baker's Haulover Beach in Dade County Florida. Five men and two women protested Jim Crow era laws that denied access to recreation based on race. In a Miami emerging from World War II this meant "colored" people could not share with whites the legendary beaches along and in the waters of Biscayne Bay and the Atlantic Ocean.%0aThe struggle for a "colored-only" beach in Miami signified the incipient civil rights revolution of the 1950s -1960s. It was fueled by the anger of patriotic black servicemen who fought the racism of Nazi Germany only to return to a segregated America. Among the protesters was Attorney Lawson B. Thomas who would later become the first Black appointed to Judge in the post-Reconstruction South. Lawyer Thomas remained on the beach, holding bail money for those who anticipated arrest. The NAACP had notified the local press and police of the time and place, hoping for arrests that would be central to a court challenge of local discrimination laws and policies. On instruction from local government representatives, police refused to cite the protestors, telling Thomas to contact County Commissioner Charles H. Crandon.%0aLocal businessmen and government officials had privately conceded something had to be done about the race problem. The economy was – and is – heavily reliant upon its good reputation with tourists. A decision was made to compromise race restrictions on recreation by designating a "colored-only" beach on Virginia Key. Crandon and Thomas negotiated the establishment of the "Virginia Key Beach, Dade County Park for the exclusive use of Negroes," (today, the Historic Virginia Key Beach Park). It opened on August 1, 1945.%0aThere are several urban myths about the selection of Virginia Key by county officials, each with a kernel of truth – but there was an historic connection of at least several decades’ standing. A 1918 survey map of the "Abandoned Military Reservation" on Virginia Key located a "Negro Dancing Pavilion" on the island's southeastern shore of the "colored-only" beach. From 1945 to 1947, Miami's Blacks traveled to the beach exclusively by boat – public and private. The opening of the Rickenbacker Causeway in 1947 connected Virginia Key and Key Biscayne with the mainland and vehicular travel began.%0aThe new Park enjoyed instant popularity. For a time, county government honored the "separate but equal" status of Virginia Key Beach with its white counterpart, Crandon Park on Key Biscayne. The original temporary buildings were replaced by permanent construction, a miniature railroad carried beachgoers around the park, and a seaside merry-go-round whirled riders of all ages. Still, Crandon Park was over 800 acres (3.2 km2) with two miles (3 km) of beachfront and Virginia Key 82 acres (330,000 m2) with a half-mile of beach.%0aWhen Crandon Park got a zoo, Virginia Key Beach got a pond with ornamental plants and so things began to change. When wealthy residents of Key Biscayne and nearby Fisher Island needed a place to dump their garbage and pump their sewage, the breezes on Virginia Key Beach turned sour, the water clouded with effluents. The long-term environmental impact has yet to be fully determined. Still, Virginia Key Beach remained a popular, even sacred place within Miami's Black community.   Segregation of Miami-Dade beaches finally ended in the early 1960s with another protest led by the late Rev. Theodore Gibson, Garth C. Reeves, the late Oscar Range and others.  On February 22, 2008, the Virginia Key Beach Park Trust re-opened the park to the public. Today, it is known as an ecological treasure which contains the largest mangrove wetland in the state. Historic landmarks such as the bathhouse, concession stand, carousel house, train tunnel, and picnic pavilions have all been renovated and opened for public use. The beach is open for wading only.%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%0a*%0a%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' ••••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Key Biscayne''%0a%0aKey Biscayne is in Miami-Dade County and is one of the best places to live in Florida. Living in Key Biscayne offers residents an urban feel and most residents own their homes. In Key Biscayne there are a lot of restaurants, coffee shops, and parks. Many retirees live in Key Biscayne and residents tend to be liberal. The public schools in Key Biscayne are above average.%0aWhile there had been earlier schemes to develop a town on Key Biscayne, it wasn't until the opening of the four-mile (6 km) long Rickenbacker Causeway from Miami to Virginia Key and on to Key Biscayne in 1947 that the island was opened up to large scale residential development. The northern two-thirds of the island had been operated as the largest coconut plantation in the continental United States during the first half of the 20th century. In 1940 the Matheson family donated over 800 acres (3.2 km2) of their land to Dade County for a public park (Crandon Park) in exchange for a commitment that the county would build a causeway to the island. The remaining Matheson property, stretching across the middle of the island, was then sold off to developers. Starting in 1951, the Mackle Construction Company offered new homes on the island for US$9,540, with just US$500 down. A U.S. Post Office contract branch was opened, the Community Church started holding services in an old coconut-husking shed, and the Key Biscayne Elementary School opened in 1952.%0aThe southern third of Key Biscayne, which included Cape Florida, was owned by James Deering and, after his death, by his brother Charles, for 35 years. In 1948 José Manuel Áleman, a Cuban politician in exile, bought the Cape Florida property from the Deering estate. After Áleman died in 1951, his widow, Elena Santeiro Garcia, added to her Cape Florida property by buying an ocean-to-bay strip that had been part of the Matheson property. This strip included a canal that had been dug by William Matheson in the 1920s, and which extended from the bay across most of the island. The land north of this canal was developed as part of what is now the Village of Key Biscayne. Garcia sold the Cape Florida property in 1966 to the state of Florida. This land became Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park, which opened January 1, 1967.%0aPresident Richard Nixon purchased the first of his three waterfront homes, forming a compound known as the Florida White House, in 1969 to be close to his close friend and confidant, Bebe Rebozo and industrialist Robert Abplanalp (inventor of the modern spray can valve). Bebe Rebozo, owner of the Key Biscayne Bank, was indicted for laundering a $100,000 donation from Howard Hughes to the Nixon election campaign. President Kennedy and Nixon met for the first time after the 1960 Election loss by Nixon in an oceanfront villa at the old Key Biscayne Hotel. Plans for the Watergate break-in at Democratic headquarters were discussed at the Key Biscayne Nixon compound and, as the Watergate scandal unfolded, Nixon spent more time in seclusion there. Nixon visited Key Biscayne more than 50 times between 1969 and 1973. The U.S. Department of Defense spent $400,000 constructing a helicopter landing pad in Biscayne Bay adjacent to the Nixon compound and when Nixon sold his property, including the helicopter pad, there were public accusations that he enriched himself at taxpayer expense.%0aThe area was incorporated as a new municipality in 1991 - the first new city in Miami-Dade County in over fifty years. Rafael Conte was elected the first mayor along with members of the founding Village Council including Clifford Brody, Mortimer Fried, Michael Hill, Luis Lauredo, Joe Rasco, and Raymond Sullivan. The municipality's first manager was C. Samuel Kissinger and the first clerk was Guido Inguanzo. The incorporation of the Village provided local control over taxes and future development.%0aIn 1992, Hurricane Andrew flooded some homes and businesses on Key Biscayne but the eyewall passed over uninhabited Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park which received the brunt of the storm. The storm damage was a blessing for the park because it destroyed all the non-native vegetation that the state had been trying to eradicate. Federal and State funding allowed the replanting with native vegetation making the park a showplace natural area. In recent years, the construction of several large resort hotels, condominium complexes and shopping centers on the island has affected the once bucolic island life, as commercialism has continued to accelerate at a frenetic pace. The Village has its own fire, police and public elementary and middle school. The millage tax rate remains one of the lowest of any municipality in Miami-Dade County. In 2004, the Village completed the construction of a civic center, including fire, police and administration buildings and a recreation and community center with indoor multi use courts, outdoor swimming pool and a renowned musical theater program.%0a%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a(:include GameRef.Directoryhelp:)

The Hawthorne and nearby Belmont districts are filled with single-family homes and apartment buildings. Bakeries, coffeehouses, boutiques, music and bookstores, micro-pubs, and restaurants line the two streets.%0a> %0a> Southeast Portland’s Hawthorne Boulevard supports a thriving district that is full of activity. Here, high-density housing meshes with retail activity, creating one of the city’s more interesting shopping areas — pedestrian friendly, lined with gift stores, period clothing shops, eateries, and espresso shops.%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25''Big Burn of 1846''%0a> %0a> In 1846, a forest fire that began on the slopes of Mt. Scott burned off most of the timber as far north as the Columbia River. This event had a profound effect on the settlement of the east side. Up until that year, much of the land east of the river was heavily wooded. The trees were soon replaced with coarse grasses. The area was so thoroughly cleared that the setting of farms was a simple matter not requiring the time-consuming and back-breaking job of clearing.%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25''Killing the Eastside Freeway and Preserving Urban Living''%0a> %0a> One event defines Portland in the past 25 years! It was killing the Mount Hood Freeway, a 6-mile, eight-lane asphalt highway that would have vaulted across the Willamette River from Johns Landing to I-205.%0a> %0a> The story of the freeway’s demise is a lesson in what distinguishes Portland from other West Coast cities. Whereas most cities were building freeways after WWII, Portland was preserving neighborhoods. It gave us strong neighborhoods, proud schools and MAX (light rail). It cemented the region’s commitment to ecology and the reputation of a brilliant political leader, Neil Goldschmidt. Stopping the freeway not only saved 1,750 households in Southeast Portland from the wrecking ball, it also established Portland’s philosophy of urban livability-the idea that cities are for people, not just for commerce and cars.%0a> %0a> In 1975 Portland took the $500 million in federal highway aid and built the transit mall, eastside MAX and a host of neighborhood and suburban transportation projects, such as Eastman Parkway in Gresham and Cornell Road in Hillsboro. Most of the money went to the light rail system.%0a> %0a22,30c35,38%0a%3c !!%25center%25''South Beach''%0a%3c %0a%3c South Beach, also nicknamed SoBe.  This area was the first section of Miami Beach to be developed, starting in the 1910s, due to the development efforts of Carl G. Fisher, the Lummus Brothers, and John S. Collins, the latter of whose construction of the Collins Bridge provided the first vital land link between mainland Miami and the beaches.%0a%3c The area has gone through numerous artificial and natural changes over the years, including a booming regional economy, increased tourism, and the 1926 hurricane, which destroyed much of the area.%0a%3c In both daytime and at nightfall, the South Beach section of Miami Beach is a major entertainment destination with hundreds of nightclubs, restaurants, boutiques and hotels. The area is popular with tourists from Canada, Europe, Israel and the entire Western Hemisphere, with some having permanent or second homes there. South Beach has also been visited by many American and foreign tourists, evidenced by the fact that the practice of topless sunbathing by women on the beach and in a few hotel pools on Miami Beach has been considered by the local citizens as being more permissive than on most beaches of the United States, and despite the fact that the practice has not been officially legalized by the local government, it continues to be adopted in large scale.%0a%3c South Beach's residents' varied backgrounds are evident in the many languages spoken.  Another unique aesthetic attribute of South Beach is the presence of several colorful and unique stands used by Miami Beach's lifeguards on South Beach. After Hurricane Andrew, Architect William Lane donated his design services to the city and added new stops on design tours in the form of lifeguard towers. His towers instantly became symbols of the revived City of Miami Beach.%0a%3c South Beach is considered a hub of LGBT lifestyle. In the 80s and 90s South beach was the center of Florida's gay life and nightlife. It is home to many hotels, clubs, and nightlife that caters to the LGBT community. Ocean Drive is a hotspot to socialize and there is LGBT friendly shopping and cocktailing on Lincoln Road. The World Erotic Art Museum on South Beach is considered a local favorite to visit.%0a%3c South Beach is also the location of the Pride Parade and Pride Festival events during Pride Week of the annual Miami Beach Pride celebration. Both of the events run through Ocean Drive from Fifth to 15th Streets. First started in 2009, Miami Beach Pride now draws over 130,000 people to South Beach every year.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!%25center%25''Ardenwald-Johnson Creek''%0a> %0a> Ardenwald is located on the Portland and Milwaukie border.

The islands are, from west to east: Biscayne Island (Miami), San Marco Island (Miami), San Marino Island (Miami Beach), Di Lido Island (Miami Beach), Rivo Alto Island (Miami Beach), and Belle Isle (Miami Beach). Flagler Monument Island remains an uninhabited picnic island, originally built in 1920 as a memorial to railroad pioneer Henry Flagler. The islands are connected by bridges from the Miami mainland to Miami Beach.%0a%3c The Venetian Islands project was proposed to be much larger than what exists today. Another causeway was to be built, called "The Drive of the Campanili." The causeway would connect Hibiscus Island (south of the Venetian Islands) with Di Lido Island. The road would then continue north right up the center of Biscayne Bay, with five new islands created along its path. The roadway would then veer slightly to the northeast, where it would end at Indian Creek Village. An additional four islands would be built along two east-west roads that would connect with the causeway. One of these roads was along the current route of the Julia Tuttle Causeway and the other along the current route of the 79th Street Causeway.%0a%3c The original bridge (called the Collins Bridge) was built by farmer and developer John S. Collins with financial assistance from automotive parts and racing pioneer Carl G. Fisher. At the time it was completed, it was the longest wooden bridge in the world. The 2½ mile wooden toll bridge opened on June 12, 1913, providing a critical link to the newly established city of Miami Beach, formerly accessible only by a ferry service.%0a%3c While none of these islands were built, the foundation pilings for one of them can still be seen in Central Biscayne Bay between Di Lido Island and the Julia Tuttle Causeway. The island was to be called Isola di Lolando.[2] The demise of the island construction was due to a combination of the aftermath of the 1926 Miami Hurricane and the end of the Florida land boom of the 1920s. The Shoreland Company went bankrupt in 1927 due to objections of "further mutilation of the waterway".%0a%3c The original wooden causeway was replaced in 1925 by a series of arch drawbridges and renamed the Venetian Causeway. Today, the causeway is a popular stretch for people to jog, ride bikes, walk dogs and stroll. The islands offer residents a suburb feel that is located between (and within minutes of) Miami Beach's South Beach and Miami's new Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!%25center%25''Brentwood-Darlington''%0a> %0a> Brentwood Darlington feels homey, family focused, community conscious and hardworking.

The island was deeded to the city in 1919 with the restriction that it only be used for public or municipal purposes. The city gave it to the state and the state deeded it back to the city with similar restrictions - both in the 1940s. In 1979 the city attempted to circumvent this prohibition by claiming that the underwater land surrounding the island is a preserve and Watson Island need not be protected as per the deed, as a park, or for public ownership and use.%0a%3c %0a%3c The island had a name change from Causeway Island to Watson Island, named for John W. Watson, Sr., who was Mayor of Miami 1912-1915 and 1917-1919. In 1932 Watson Island was considered for the site of Miami's Pan-American Exposition, a World's Fair and "International Merchandise mart." By the end of the 1940s, however, the site of the Exposition, now called Interama, was moved North to where Oleta River State Park is today.%0a%3c A Goodyear Blimp base was located on Watson Island from 1930 to 1978, initially on the east side of the island and later on a new landfill area to the west. Goodyear moved the base to Opa-locka Airport after failing to agree on lease renewal terms with the city. Vestiges of the old base still remain such as the imprint of the mooring circle and a paved path for a small tram that would transport passengers to the airship.%0a%3c Grand plans to develop the island started in 1979, with a planned amusement park, Diplomat World. Residents formed "Save Watson Island, Inc", a neighborhood group opposing the use for anything other than a park. They had public demonstrations and because of the demonstrations and a variety of other reasons, the amusement park was never built%0a%3c Another development included one from the late 1990s, culminating in 2003 when Jungle Island relocated to Watson. There has been continued controversy stemming from Jungle Island's inability to meet the financing terms it had made with the local municipalities when the move was approved. Local elected officials had and continue to bail out Jungle Island with tax dollars. The Miami Children's Museum also relocated to the island, in 2004. The State of Florida offered a site in the Island Gardens project on Watson Island to host the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) Permanent Secretariat.[4] As of March 2006 the Florida Department of Transportation was planning to construct a tunnel from the Port of Miami on Dodge Island under the main shipping channel to the MacArthur Causeway on Watson Island. On May 24, 2010, construction began on the Port of Miami Tunnel; it was completed on August 3, 2014%0a%3c Aviation Center - Chalk's International Airlines maintained a seaplane base on Watson Island from 1926 until it ceased operation in 2007. As of 2006, the City of Miami is relocating the Miami Heliport to a site adjacent to Chalk's seaplane base, with the intention of creating an Aviation Center serving corporate and tourism needs.%0a%3c The Ichimura Miami - Japanese Garden grew out of the efforts of Kiyoshi Ichimura, who sent objects, materials and artisans from Tokyo to Miami in the 1950s to construct the San-Ai-An Japanese Garden on Watson Island. The garden opened in 1961. As of 2006, the garden was being redesigned and reconstructed.%0a%3c Jungle Island - Jungle Island opened its new facility on Watson Island in 2003. Originally named Parrot Jungle, the popular tourist attraction first opened in the Pinecrest neighborhood of Miami in 1936. Over the years, the attraction came to be a popular attraction for Miami residents and tourists, but that trend reversed once it moved to the smaller and less natural setting of Watson Island. Jungle Island has many fewer animals, and none of the old growth vegetation the original park was known for. Jungle Island hosts Miami's most popular event venue with its Treetop Ballroom.%0a%3c Miami Children's Museum - The Miami Children's Museum opened a new 56,500-square-foot (5,250 m2) facility on Watson Island in 2003. It has ten galleries, classrooms, birthday party rooms, a parent/teacher resource center, an educational gift shop, a 200-seat auditorium and a dining area.%0a%3c Miami Outboard Club - The Miami Outboard Club has been located on Watson Island since 1948. It is active in conservation and artificial reef programs, and provides social and educational activities. The club has boat slips, dry storage, a boat lift, a ramp for jet skis and other small craft, and a restaurant, bar and an internet cafe.%0a%3c Miami Yacht Club - The Miami Yacht Club has been located on Watson Island since the late 1940s. It offers youth and adult sailing programs, and sponsors races, regattas and a Sea Scout ship. The club has boat slips, dry storage, and a lounge, bar and restaurant.%0a%3c Public Boat Ramp - There is a Public Boat Ramp with 50 oversized parking spaces for vehicles with boat trailers.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!%25center%25%25vampire%25''Brooklyn''%25%25%0a> %0a> Brooklyn is in a great location as it is in close proximity to some of Portland’s most hip and popular neighborhoods such as Sellwood, Hawthorne and Clinton.

As of 2015, Fisher Island had the highest per capita income of any place in the United States. The CDP had only 218 households and a total population of 467.%0a%3c Named for automotive parts pioneer and beach real estate developer Carl G. Fisher, who once owned it, Fisher Island is three miles off shore of mainland South Florida. No road or causeway connects to the island, which is accessible by private boat, helicopter, or ferry. Once a one-family island home of the Vanderbilts, and later several other millionaires, it was sold for development in the 1960s. The property sat vacant for well over 15 years before development was begun for very limited and restrictive multi-family use. The island was created in 1905 by a dredging and land reclamation projects in and around Miami Beach. Construction of Fisher Island began in 1919 when Carl G. Fisher, a land developer, purchased the property from businessmen and real estate developer Dana A. Dorsey, southern Florida's first African-American millionaire. In 1925 William Kissam Vanderbilt II traded a luxury yacht to Fisher for ownership of the island.%0a%3c After Vanderbilt's death in 1944, the ownership of the island passed to U.S. Steel heir Edward Moore. Moore died in the early 1950s, and Gar Wood, the millionaire inventor of hydraulic construction equipment, bought it. Wood, a speedboat enthusiast, kept the island a one-family retreat. In 1963, Wood sold to a development group that included local Key Biscayne millionaire Bebe Rebozo, a Miami native and United States Senator George Smathers and then former U.S. Vice President Richard Nixon, who had promised to leave politics. During his subsequent presidency from 1968–1973, and during the Watergate scandal, Nixon maintained a home on nearby Key Biscayne known as the "Key Biscayne Whitehouse" that was the former residence of Senator Smathers and next door to Rebozo, but none of the three ever resided on Fisher Island.%0a%3c The Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS) of the University of Miami maintained the Comparative Sedimentology Laboratory on Fisher Island from 1972 to 1990 under the leadership of Robert Ginsburg.%0a%3c After years of legal battles and changes in ownership, further development on the island was finally started in the 1980s, with architecture matching the original 1920s Spanish style mansions. Although no longer a one-family island, in 2005, Fisher Island still remains somewhat inaccessible to the public and uninvited guests, and is as exclusive by modern standards as it was in the days of the Vanderbilts, providing similar refuge and retreat for its residents. The island contains mansions, a hotel, several apartment buildings, an observatory, and a private marina. Boris Becker, Oprah Winfrey, and Mel Brooks are among the celebrities with homes on the island.  In 2005, the island attempted to incorporate as a town, but the Miami-Dade County Commission did not support this initiative.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!%25center%25''Creston-Kenilworth''%0a> %0a> One of the older areas of Portland, Creston Kenilworth, is a residential neighborhood located in southeast Portland.

There are several nice, older parks here, including Kenilworth Park and Creston Park, which has a pool and a dog park. Tree-lined streets give Creston-Kenilworth the atmosphere of a quiet neighborhood, even along busier roads.

Early accounts by Spanish explorers indicated the existence of one or more inlets somewhere on the long spit of land enclosing the northern end of Biscayne Bay, but such inlets open and close over time. At the beginning of the 19th century, there was no inlet through the barrier island between the New River Inlet and Bear Cut, at the northern end of Key Biscayne. Hurricanes in 1835 and 1838 opened a new inlet, Narrows Cut (now known as Norris Cut), separating Virginia Key from what is now Fisher Island at the south end of Miami Beach.%0a%3c The island was named by Frederick H. Gerdes of the United States Coast Survey in 1849. He noted that the island north of Key Biscayne had no name, and had not existed as an island until 'Narrows Cut' had broken through "ten or twelve" years before (i.e., the hurricane of 1835 or 1838). He described Virginia Key as three miles (5 km) long and one mile (1.6 km) wide (later, as five miles (8 km) long and one-and-a-half miles wide), with a fine Atlantic beach, but mostly covered with mangroves.  Scenes from the 1994 comedy film Ace Ventura: Pet Detective were shot here.In May 1945, seven civil rights activists supported by the local NAACP chapter staged a "wade-in" at the whites’ only Baker's Haulover Beach in Dade County Florida. Five men and two women protested Jim Crow era laws that denied access to recreation based on race. In a Miami emerging from World War II this meant "colored" people could not share with whites the legendary beaches along and in the waters of Biscayne Bay and the Atlantic Ocean.%0a%3c The struggle for a "colored-only" beach in Miami signified the incipient civil rights revolution of the 1950s -1960s. It was fueled by the anger of patriotic black servicemen who fought the racism of Nazi Germany only to return to a segregated America. Among the protesters was Attorney Lawson B. Thomas who would later become the first Black appointed to Judge in the post-Reconstruction South. Lawyer Thomas remained on the beach, holding bail money for those who anticipated arrest. The NAACP had notified the local press and police of the time and place, hoping for arrests that would be central to a court challenge of local discrimination laws and policies. On instruction from local government representatives, police refused to cite the protestors, telling Thomas to contact County Commissioner Charles H. Crandon.%0a%3c Local businessmen and government officials had privately conceded something had to be done about the race problem. The economy was – and is – heavily reliant upon its good reputation with tourists. A decision was made to compromise race restrictions on recreation by designating a "colored-only" beach on Virginia Key. Crandon and Thomas negotiated the establishment of the "Virginia Key Beach, Dade County Park for the exclusive use of Negroes," (today, the Historic Virginia Key Beach Park). It opened on August 1, 1945.%0a%3c There are several urban myths about the selection of Virginia Key by county officials, each with a kernel of truth – but there was an historic connection of at least several decades’ standing. A 1918 survey map of the "Abandoned Military Reservation" on Virginia Key located a "Negro Dancing Pavilion" on the island's southeastern shore of the "colored-only" beach. From 1945 to 1947, Miami's Blacks traveled to the beach exclusively by boat – public and private. The opening of the Rickenbacker Causeway in 1947 connected Virginia Key and Key Biscayne with the mainland and vehicular travel began.%0a%3c The new Park enjoyed instant popularity. For a time, county government honored the "separate but equal" status of Virginia Key Beach with its white counterpart, Crandon Park on Key Biscayne. The original temporary buildings were replaced by permanent construction, a miniature railroad carried beachgoers around the park, and a seaside merry-go-round whirled riders of all ages. Still, Crandon Park was over 800 acres (3.2 km2) with two miles (3 km) of beachfront and Virginia Key 82 acres (330,000 m2) with a half-mile of beach.%0a%3c When Crandon Park got a zoo, Virginia Key Beach got a pond with ornamental plants and so things began to change. When wealthy residents of Key Biscayne and nearby Fisher Island needed a place to dump their garbage and pump their sewage, the breezes on Virginia Key Beach turned sour, the water clouded with effluents. The long-term environmental impact has yet to be fully determined. Still, Virginia Key Beach remained a popular, even sacred place within Miami's Black community.   Segregation of Miami-Dade beaches finally ended in the early 1960s with another protest led by the late Rev. Theodore Gibson, Garth C. Reeves, the late Oscar Range and others.  On February 22, 2008, the Virginia Key Beach Park Trust re-opened the park to the public. Today, it is known as an ecological treasure which contains the largest mangrove wetland in the state. Historic landmarks such as the bathhouse, concession stand, carousel house, train tunnel, and picnic pavilions have all been renovated and opened for public use.

Living in Key Biscayne offers residents an urban feel and most residents own their homes. In Key Biscayne there are a lot of restaurants, coffee shops, and parks. Many retirees live in Key Biscayne and residents tend to be liberal. The public schools in Key Biscayne are above average.%0a%3c While there had been earlier schemes to develop a town on Key Biscayne, it wasn't until the opening of the four-mile (6 km) long Rickenbacker Causeway from Miami to Virginia Key and on to Key Biscayne in 1947 that the island was opened up to large scale residential development. The northern two-thirds of the island had been operated as the largest coconut plantation in the continental United States during the first half of the 20th century. In 1940 the Matheson family donated over 800 acres (3.2 km2) of their land to Dade County for a public park (Crandon Park) in exchange for a commitment that the county would build a causeway to the island. The remaining Matheson property, stretching across the middle of the island, was then sold off to developers. Starting in 1951, the Mackle Construction Company offered new homes on the island for US$9,540, with just US$500 down. A U.S. Post Office contract branch was opened, the Community Church started holding services in an old coconut-husking shed, and the Key Biscayne Elementary School opened in 1952.%0a%3c The southern third of Key Biscayne, which included Cape Florida, was owned by James Deering and, after his death, by his brother Charles, for 35 years. In 1948 José Manuel Áleman, a Cuban politician in exile, bought the Cape Florida property from the Deering estate. After Áleman died in 1951, his widow, Elena Santeiro Garcia, added to her Cape Florida property by buying an ocean-to-bay strip that had been part of the Matheson property. This strip included a canal that had been dug by William Matheson in the 1920s, and which extended from the bay across most of the island. The land north of this canal was developed as part of what is now the Village of Key Biscayne. Garcia sold the Cape Florida property in 1966 to the state of Florida. This land became Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park, which opened January 1, 1967.%0a%3c President Richard Nixon purchased the first of his three waterfront homes, forming a compound known as the Florida White House, in 1969 to be close to his close friend and confidant, Bebe Rebozo and industrialist Robert Abplanalp (inventor of the modern spray can valve). Bebe Rebozo, owner of the Key Biscayne Bank, was indicted for laundering a $100,000 donation from Howard Hughes to the Nixon election campaign. President Kennedy and Nixon met for the first time after the 1960 Election loss by Nixon in an oceanfront villa at the old Key Biscayne Hotel. Plans for the Watergate break-in at Democratic headquarters were discussed at the Key Biscayne Nixon compound and, as the Watergate scandal unfolded, Nixon spent more time in seclusion there. Nixon visited Key Biscayne more than 50 times between 1969 and 1973. The U.S. Department of Defense spent $400,000 constructing a helicopter landing pad in Biscayne Bay adjacent to the Nixon compound and when Nixon sold his property, including the helicopter pad, there were public accusations that he enriched himself at taxpayer expense.%0a%3c The area was incorporated as a new municipality in 1991 - the first new city in Miami-Dade County in over fifty years. Rafael Conte was elected the first mayor along with members of the founding Village Council including Clifford Brody, Mortimer Fried, Michael Hill, Luis Lauredo, Joe Rasco, and Raymond Sullivan. The municipality's first manager was C. Samuel Kissinger and the first clerk was Guido Inguanzo. The incorporation of the Village provided local control over taxes and future development.%0a%3c In 1992, Hurricane Andrew flooded some homes and businesses on Key Biscayne but the eyewall passed over uninhabited Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park which received the brunt of the storm. The storm damage was a blessing for the park because it destroyed all the non-native vegetation that the state had been trying to eradicate. Federal and State funding allowed the replanting with native vegetation making the park a showplace natural area. In recent years, the construction of several large resort hotels, condominium complexes and shopping centers on the island has affected the once bucolic island life, as commercialism has continued to accelerate at a frenetic pace. The Village has its own fire, police and public elementary and middle school. The millage tax rate remains one of the lowest of any municipality in Miami-Dade County. In 2004, the Village completed the construction of a civic center, including fire, police and administration buildings and a recreation and community center with indoor multi use courts, outdoor swimming pool and a renowned musical theater program.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!%25center%25''Foster-Powell''%0a> %0a> As a result of the Portland real estate market boom, Foster-Powell has seen an influx of new residents to the area which has helped to create a new and vibrant community. As one might imagine, Foster-Powell has some wonderful areas with beautifully improved homes and neighborhoods and some still in transition. There is a very high concentration of recent immigrants with Foster-Powell being home to a large portion of Portland’s Russian and Ukrainian immigrants. There are some great authentic restaurants and shops in this neighborhood. A good mix of singles and families, renters and owners. This neighborhood is a good mix of people from all different walks of life and cultures. There are a lot of young families here and as such, many neighborhood communities pushing for positive change.%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a> *%0a> *%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Locations'''%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> %0a> %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25%25vampire%25''Hosford-Abernethy''%25%25%0a> %0a> The neighborhood is a diverse combination of business, industry, and residential areas.%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a> *%25vampire%25Vampire Faction%25%25%0a> *%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Locations'''%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> %0a> %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25''Kerns''%0a> %0a> Kerns, being relatively close-in to downtown Portland, is in a fairly urban area and a result, is a heavy mix of commercial and residential. As Kerns covers a fairly small urban area, there is not a lot of residential property within Kerns, but what there is consists of older east Portland homes—beautiful large, substantial homes with period charm and detail, many of which have been converted over the years into multi-family units and multiplexes. Portland four-squares and large Craftsman style bungalows line the streets, tucked into the more commercial areas. Kerns has many popular Portland restaurants and locally owned businesses, making this a fun neighborhood to visit. The Buckman - Kerns shops, bars, and restaurants along Burnside and 28th Avenue are some of the best in town. The Laurelhurst Theater is a great old classic theater for catching a movie. Buckman and Kerns neighborhoods are also home to some of Portland’s finest micro breweries. Kerns is considered to be urban, artsy, bike-friendly, green and eco-conscious. This is a neighborhood of families, singles, and urbanites.%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a> *%0a> *%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' •••%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Locations'''%0a> *Overtime%0a> *Fairfield Memorial Clinic%0a> *[[City.Defiant|Defiant]]%0a> %0a> '''Embassy Seals'''%0a> %0a> Neutral Ground (All), Safe (All), Wolfblood-Owned (All), Rite of Crossing (All)%0a> %0a> %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25''Laurelhurst''%0a> %0a> Laurelhurst is a beautiful area full of charming homes in all shapes and sizes, from the cute bungalow with a covered front porch, to sprawling stone and brick homes with grand lawns.

This is a wonderful neighborhood of older Portland homes and old growth trees lining many of the streets. The Montavilla Farmers Market is not to be missed. This farmers market is really well outfitted with local vendors and is a staple of the community. Nearby Mt Tabor is a very popular park for hiking, biking and many other activities. For some fun trivia, Mt Tabor is an active volcano in the city of Portland. Urban, artsy, bike-friendly, green and eco-conscious.

Scott-Aleta''%0a> %0a> Mt. Scott is a nice, family friendly suburb located in the SE portion of Portland. We all know it rains in Portland. And it rains. Because of this, Mt. Scott Community Center is very popular throughout Portland, due to its indoor pool with fun slides, the roller skating rink, indoor playground, etc. Another plus with the Mt. Scott area are the nice neighborhoods that exemplify a real family spirit. This area seems to attract younger families and singles. Homes mostly consist of of the traditional style including Craftsman, Bungalow and Colonial. There are some really nice cafes and unique stores. Another big plus is Mt. Scott park located on SE 72nd street which has a nice massive sized sports field, play structures and picnic areas.

Homes here are upscale and the neighborhood is lined with old growth trees. The Reed neighborhood is one of the most coveted in the urban Portland area. Reed College is a major presence in the area. Residents have no shortage of dining, coffee, pub and retail options in any of the surrounding neighborhoods. Urban, artsy, educated, classy, community minded, green and eco-conscious.

From the check cashing, strip mall aesthetic of Powell Boulevard to the insanely eclectic, hip Hawthorne District, you can find everything from smoky pool halls and porno to haute cuisine and $300.00 bowls. Urban, artsy, down-home, community minded, green and eco-conscious. Anti-car, some even anti-establishment. This is a neighborhood of families and young urbanites. As with the urban Portland trend, this neighborhood is very eclectic. Richmond homes vary substantially in form and style and, significantly, landscaping. Stuff just loves to grow here, as in all of Portland, but walking the streets one gets the definite sense that any neighborhood association that exists has long ago given up trying to beat back nature. Sidewalks are often shared, and “manicured” is not exactly a word that springs to mind. But then again, “unkempt” doesn’t either.%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a> [[Players.ElkinsGang|The Elkins Gang]]%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' •••%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Locations'''%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> %0a> %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25''Sellwood-Moreland''%0a> %0a> Sellwood feels much less “hipster” and “chic” than say, Mississippi Ave, Alberta Arts or the Pearl— but a definite, at ease kind of ‘anything goes, all are welcome’ type of feeling is present on these streets. Like most Portland neighborhoods, Sellwood and Moreland neighborhoods feel very self-sustaining. Local grocery store New Seasons, many local coffee shops plus a few local coffee roasters make this community feel warm and a lot like its own small town. Walking the streets in Sellwood and Moreland neighborhoods invokes a “back in the good old days” feeling. This area is family friendly, walkable, and livable with a strong sense of community pride.%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a> *%0a> *%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Locations'''%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> %0a> %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25''South Tabor''%0a> %0a> South Tabor is a largely residential area located South of the Mt. Tabor neighborhood. The neighborhoods are named for the locally famous Mount Tabor, an extinct volcano, in the area. The modest family homes in this area were built from the early 1900’s to today, with many cute ranches, cottages and bungalows, still in an affordable price range in comparison to other Portland areas. This is a great area to look for a starter, first time home, or a nice family home in a pleasant neighborhood with plenty of shopping and conveniences nearby. This is a great neighborhood of families, singles and urbanites. This area feels community conscious, eco-friendly, and very family friendly.

Known to most as “Belmont”, Sunnyside has a strong sense of Portland individuality. Sunnyside has many locally owned coffee shops, markets, and distinctive shops and restaurants. Belmont Street is a favorite destination for many locals, whether it’s for an afternoon at the Avalon Arcade, a night at the Blue Monk, or a cup of coffee at the neighborhood cafe. This area has a nice mix of urban diversity, with a funky feel, and local color. Funky, free, artsy, a bit grungy here and there and overall, very open. This is an indie business haven. The Sunnyside neighborhood is a mix of singles, families, hippies and urbanites. Think green, eco-friendly, front yards that are actually vegetable gardens, smart cars, car-free, funky home colors and decor.%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a> [[Players.TheTriad|The Triad - Zhang Family]]%0a> *%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Locations'''%0a> *[[Players.AndreasHouseAndWorkshop|54 South-East Belmont Street]]%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> %0a> %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25''Woodstock''%0a> %0a> This is a lovely area of Portland with many nice older homes tucked into quiet neighborhood streets.

Some say that Southeast is where the “real” people live.Cross over the Willamette River from downtown and you’re in the Southeast’s Central Eastside Industrial District, home to the industrial plants that provide thousands of jobs for Portlanders. It’s also home to the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry.%0a%3c %0a%3c Many eastside residents take the Hawthorne Bridge (photo on the left) to enter the downtown area or leave it. This beautiful photograph of the bridge was taken by Adrienne Cleveland of Portland.%0a%3c %0a%3c Travel east from the Central Industrial District a mile or so and you’ll run into the Hawthorne area. The Hawthorne and nearby Belmont districts are filled with single-family homes and apartment buildings. Bakeries, coffeehouses, boutiques, music and bookstores, micro-pubs, and restaurants line the two streets.%0a%3c %0a%3c Southeast Portland’s Hawthorne Boulevard supports a thriving district that is full of activity. Here, high-density housing meshes with retail activity, creating one of the city’s more interesting shopping areas — pedestrian friendly, lined with gift stores, period clothing shops, eateries, and espresso shops.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25'''Big Burn of 1846'''%0a%3c %0a%3c In 1846, a forest fire that began on the slopes of Mt. Scott burned off most of the timber as far north as the Columbia River. This event had a profound effect on the settlement of the east side. Up until that year, much of the land east of the river was heavily wooded. The trees were soon replaced with coarse grasses. The area was so thoroughly cleared that the setting of farms was a simple matter not requiring the time-consuming and back-breaking job of clearing.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25'''Killing the Eastside Freeway and Preserving Urban Living'''%0a%3c %0a%3c One event defines Portland in the past 25 years! It was killing the Mount Hood Freeway, a 6-mile, eight-lane asphalt highway that would have vaulted across the Willamette River from Johns Landing to I-205.%0a%3c %0a%3c The story of the freeway’s demise is a lesson in what distinguishes Portland from other West Coast cities. Whereas most cities were building freeways after WWII, Portland was preserving neighborhoods. It gave us strong neighborhoods, proud schools and MAX (light rail). It cemented the region’s commitment to ecology and the reputation of a brilliant political leader, Neil Goldschmidt. Stopping the freeway not only saved 1,750 households in Southeast Portland from the wrecking ball, it also established Portland’s philosophy of urban livability-the idea that cities are for people, not just for commerce and cars.%0a%3c %0a%3c In 1975 Portland took the $500 million in federal highway aid and built the transit mall, eastside MAX and a host of neighborhood and suburban transportation projects, such as Eastman Parkway in Gresham and Cornell Road in Hillsboro. Most of the money went to the light rail system.%0a---%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

More country like than other surrounding neighborhoods, Ardenwald keeps a low profile. Filled with young families and old time residents, this community has an old fashioned feel. Home style varies and many sit on large lots with attached green spaces. For those that enjoy a rustic setting, then this may be the place for you. The neighborhood is populated with local small stores and a few family restaurants, but if you want variety, Ardenwald may not the place for you.

The neighborhood is home to several large-scale urban gardening projects, including the Brentwood Community Garden, which was improved and expanded in 2010 through a grant from The Home Depot and Fiskars.

Brooklyn is definitely a favorite and in-demand Portland neighborhood and feels very community friendly, safe and family focused. Dog walkers, runners, babes in strollers and people of all sorts busy the streets. Brooklyn, like most of its close-by sister neighborhoods, is fiercely independent and has a high number of locally owned businesses who thrive due to overwhelming local support. Brooklyn could easily be all things to all people: a laid back family oriented neighborhood, old trees and kids playing in the streets.

Residents have plenty of independent retail, coffee, pub and dining options just a stones throw away in most cases across several adjoining neighborhoods. Buckman and Kerns neighborhoods are also home to some of Portland’s finest micro breweries. Buckman’s Hawthorne District is one of the most unique, and most popular areas in Southeast Portland. The area is known for its wonderful restored old Portland homes, liberal residents, and fun and funky feel. The street is lined with unique restaurants and shops, and has a definite Portland-local flair.

It’s a nice area for families, but the age group is diverse. The Portland influence is not far away, as you can find a little bit of traditional mixed in with some funky, but it’s all very charming. There are several nice, older parks here, including Kenilworth Park and Creston Park, which has a pool and a dog park. Tree-lined streets give Creston-Kenilworth the atmosphere of a quiet neighborhood, even along busier roads. There is lots of shopping, especially to the Northeast, where businesses are mostly contained in strip malls. Unfortunately, some of these areas have experienced some crime over the past few years, though the neighborhood still feels very safe for families, especially during daylight hours.%0a%3c %0a%3c Neighborhood claimed by%0a%3c Link%0a%3c Average Resources%0a%3c &#9679;&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;%0a%3c Locations%0a%3c Link%0a%3c Link%0a%3c Link%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Eastmoreland%0a%3c Moreland is technically divided into two neighborhoods, Westmoreland (considered a part of the Sellwood-Moreland neighborhood by the City of Portland) and Eastmoreland. Eastmoreland features sprawling homes set back from the street on expansive lawns, with beautiful gardens. A canopy of mature trees lining the streets makes this an inviting and serene area to live. Reed College is located in the area, as is the beautiful Crystal Springs Rhododendron Garden, Eastmoreland Golf Course, and Berkeley Park. Eastmoreland feels a bit east coast with the larger colonial homes. There is a definite family friendly feel here. People seem active and community conscious here.

As one might imagine, Foster-Powell has some wonderful areas with beautifully improved homes and neighborhoods and some still in transition. There is a very high concentration of recent immigrants with Foster-Powell being home to a large portion of Portland’s Russian and Ukrainian immigrants. There are some great authentic restaurants and shops in this neighborhood. A good mix of singles and families, renters and owners. This neighborhood is a good mix of people from all different walks of life and cultures.

As Kerns covers a fairly small urban area, there is not a lot of residential property within Kerns, but what there is consists of older east Portland homes—beautiful large, substantial homes with period charm and detail, many of which have been converted over the years into multi-family units and multiplexes. Portland four-squares and large Craftsman style bungalows line the streets, tucked into the more commercial areas. Kerns has many popular Portland restaurants and locally owned businesses, making this a fun neighborhood to visit. The Buckman - Kerns shops, bars, and restaurants along Burnside and 28th Avenue are some of the best in town. The Laurelhurst Theater is a great old classic theater for catching a movie. Buckman and Kerns neighborhoods are also home to some of Portland’s finest micro breweries. Kerns is considered to be urban, artsy, bike-friendly, green and eco-conscious.

As with the urban Portland trend, this neighborhood is very eclectic. Richmond homes vary substantially in form and style and, significantly, landscaping. Stuff just loves to grow here, as in all of Portland, but walking the streets one gets the definite sense that any neighborhood association that exists has long ago given up trying to beat back nature. Sidewalks are often shared, and “manicured” is not exactly a word that springs to mind. But then again, “unkempt” doesn’t either.%0a%3c %0a%3c Neighborhood claimed by%0a%3c Link%0a%3c Average Resources%0a%3c &#9679;&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;%0a%3c Locations%0a%3c Link%0a%3c Link%0a%3c Link%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Sellwood-Moreland%0a%3c Sellwood feels much less “hipster” and “chic” than say, Mississippi Ave, Alberta Arts or the Pearl— but a definite, at ease kind of ‘anything goes, all are welcome’ type of feeling is present on these streets.
