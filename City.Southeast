Some say that Southeast is where the “real” people live.Cross over the Willamette River from downtown and you’re in the Southeast’s Central Eastside Industrial District, home to the industrial plants that provide thousands of jobs for Portlanders. It’s also home to the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry.%0a%0aMany eastside residents take the Hawthorne Bridge (photo on the left) to enter the downtown area or leave it. This beautiful photograph of the bridge was taken by Adrienne Cleveland of Portland.%0a%0aTravel east from the Central Industrial District a mile or so and you’ll run into the Hawthorne area. The Hawthorne and nearby Belmont districts are filled with single-family homes and apartment buildings. Bakeries, coffeehouses, boutiques, music and bookstores, micro-pubs, and restaurants line the two streets.%0a%0aSoutheast Portland’s Hawthorne Boulevard supports a thriving district that is full of activity. Here, high-density housing meshes with retail activity, creating one of the city’s more interesting shopping areas — pedestrian friendly, lined with gift stores, period clothing shops, eateries, and espresso shops.%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Big Burn of 1846''%0a%0aIn 1846, a forest fire that began on the slopes of Mt. Scott burned off most of the timber as far north as the Columbia River. This event had a profound effect on the settlement of the east side. Up until that year, much of the land east of the river was heavily wooded. The trees were soon replaced with coarse grasses. The area was so thoroughly cleared that the setting of farms was a simple matter not requiring the time-consuming and back-breaking job of clearing.%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Killing the Eastside Freeway and Preserving Urban Living''%0a%0aOne event defines Portland in the past 25 years! It was killing the Mount Hood Freeway, a 6-mile, eight-lane asphalt highway that would have vaulted across the Willamette River from Johns Landing to I-205.%0a%0aThe story of the freeway’s demise is a lesson in what distinguishes Portland from other West Coast cities. Whereas most cities were building freeways after WWII, Portland was preserving neighborhoods. It gave us strong neighborhoods, proud schools and MAX (light rail). It cemented the region’s commitment to ecology and the reputation of a brilliant political leader, Neil Goldschmidt. Stopping the freeway not only saved 1,750 households in Southeast Portland from the wrecking ball, it also established Portland’s philosophy of urban livability-the idea that cities are for people, not just for commerce and cars.%0a%0aIn 1975 Portland took the $500 million in federal highway aid and built the transit mall, eastside MAX and a host of neighborhood and suburban transportation projects, such as Eastman Parkway in Gresham and Cornell Road in Hillsboro. Most of the money went to the light rail system.%0a%0a[[#to]]%0a!!%25center%25''Ardenwald-Johnson Creek''%0a%0aArdenwald is located on the Portland and Milwaukie border. More country like than other surrounding neighborhoods, Ardenwald keeps a low profile. Filled with young families and old time residents, this community has an old fashioned feel. Home style varies and many sit on large lots with attached green spaces. For those that enjoy a rustic setting, then this may be the place for you. The neighborhood is populated with local small stores and a few family restaurants, but if you want variety, Ardenwald may not the place for you. Located in the area is Tideman Johnson Natural Area along Johnson Creek, which is popular for bird watching and hiking for nature lovers.%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Brentwood-Darlington''%0a%0aBrentwood Darlington feels homey, family focused, community conscious and hardworking. This feels like a very run of the mill outer Portland neighborhood and that is a great thing. It feels good to be normal. The neighborhood is home to several large-scale urban gardening projects, including the Brentwood Community Garden, which was improved and expanded in 2010 through a grant from The Home Depot and Fiskars.

Residents have plenty of coffee, pub and dining options just a stones throw away in most cases across several adjoining neighborhoods. Brooklyn is definitely a favorite and in-demand Portland neighborhood and feels very community friendly, safe and family focused. Dog walkers, runners, babes in strollers and people of all sorts busy the streets. Brooklyn, like most of its close-by sister neighborhoods, is fiercely independent and has a high number of locally owned businesses who thrive due to overwhelming local support. Brooklyn could easily be all things to all people: a laid back family oriented neighborhood, old trees and kids playing in the streets. From traditional, to modest, to funky, to fun, the Brooklyn neighborhood character is evident nearly everywhere you look.%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%25vampire%25Vampire Faction%25%25%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Buckman''%0a%0aThe Buckman neighborhood is in a great location as it is in close proximity to some of Portland’s most hip and popular neighborhoods such as Kerns, Laurelhurst, and Belmont. Residents have plenty of independent retail, coffee, pub and dining options just a stones throw away in most cases across several adjoining neighborhoods. Buckman and Kerns neighborhoods are also home to some of Portland’s finest micro breweries. Buckman’s Hawthorne District is one of the most unique, and most popular areas in Southeast Portland. The area is known for its wonderful restored old Portland homes, liberal residents, and fun and funky feel. The street is lined with unique restaurants and shops, and has a definite Portland-local flair. Local area standouts are Wild Abandon Restaurant & The Red Velvet Lounge, Slow Bar, Rontoms, Lucky Labrador Brew Pub and The East Bank Saloon.%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Guardian Games%0a*Petcetera%0a*Quarter World Arcade%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Creston-Kenilworth''%0a%0aOne of the older areas of Portland, Creston Kenilworth, is a residential neighborhood located in southeast Portland. It’s a nice area for families, but the age group is diverse. The Portland influence is not far away, as you can find a little bit of traditional mixed in with some funky, but it’s all very charming. There are several nice, older parks here, including Kenilworth Park and Creston Park, which has a pool and a dog park. Tree-lined streets give Creston-Kenilworth the atmosphere of a quiet neighborhood, even along busier roads. There is lots of shopping, especially to the Northeast, where businesses are mostly contained in strip malls. Unfortunately, some of these areas have experienced some crime over the past few years, though the neighborhood still feels very safe for families, especially during daylight hours.%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Eastmoreland''%0a%0aMoreland is technically divided into two neighborhoods, Westmoreland (considered a part of the Sellwood-Moreland neighborhood by the City of Portland) and Eastmoreland. Eastmoreland features sprawling homes set back from the street on expansive lawns, with beautiful gardens. A canopy of mature trees lining the streets makes this an inviting and serene area to live. Reed College is located in the area, as is the beautiful Crystal Springs Rhododendron Garden, Eastmoreland Golf Course, and Berkeley Park. Eastmoreland feels a bit east coast with the larger colonial homes. There is a definite family friendly feel here. People seem active and community conscious here.

As one might imagine, Foster-Powell has some wonderful areas with beautifully improved homes and neighborhoods and some still in transition. There is a very high concentration of recent immigrants with Foster-Powell being home to a large portion of Portland’s Russian and Ukrainian immigrants. There are some great authentic restaurants and shops in this neighborhood. A good mix of singles and families, renters and owners. This neighborhood is a good mix of people from all different walks of life and cultures. There are a lot of young families here and as such, many neighborhood communities pushing for positive change.%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25vampire%25''Hosford-Abernethy''%25%25%0a%0aThe neighborhood is a diverse combination of business, industry, and residential areas.%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%25vampire%25Vampire Faction%25%25%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Kerns''%0a%0aKerns, being relatively close-in to downtown Portland, is in a fairly urban area and a result, is a heavy mix of commercial and residential. As Kerns covers a fairly small urban area, there is not a lot of residential property within Kerns, but what there is consists of older east Portland homes—beautiful large, substantial homes with period charm and detail, many of which have been converted over the years into multi-family units and multiplexes. Portland four-squares and large Craftsman style bungalows line the streets, tucked into the more commercial areas. Kerns has many popular Portland restaurants and locally owned businesses, making this a fun neighborhood to visit. The Buckman - Kerns shops, bars, and restaurants along Burnside and 28th Avenue are some of the best in town. The Laurelhurst Theater is a great old classic theater for catching a movie. Buckman and Kerns neighborhoods are also home to some of Portland’s finest micro breweries. Kerns is considered to be urban, artsy, bike-friendly, green and eco-conscious.

This farmers market is really well outfitted with local vendors and is a staple of the community. Nearby Mt Tabor is a very popular park for hiking, biking and many other activities.

Scott area are the nice neighborhoods that exemplify a real family spirit. This area seems to attract younger families and singles. Homes mostly consist of of the traditional style including Craftsman, Bungalow and Colonial. There are some really nice cafes and unique stores. Another big plus is Mt.

From the check cashing, strip mall aesthetic of Powell Boulevard to the insanely eclectic, hip Hawthorne District, you can find everything from smoky pool halls and porno to haute cuisine and $300.00 bowls. Urban, artsy, down-home, community minded, green and eco-conscious. Anti-car, some even anti-establishment. This is a neighborhood of families and young urbanites. As with the urban Portland trend, this neighborhood is very eclectic. Richmond homes vary substantially in form and style and, significantly, landscaping. Stuff just loves to grow here, as in all of Portland, but walking the streets one gets the definite sense that any neighborhood association that exists has long ago given up trying to beat back nature. Sidewalks are often shared, and “manicured” is not exactly a word that springs to mind. But then again, “unkempt” doesn’t either.%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a[[Players.ElkinsGang|The Elkins Gang]]%0a%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' •••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Sellwood-Moreland''%0a%0aSellwood feels much less “hipster” and “chic” than say, Mississippi Ave, Alberta Arts or the Pearl— but a definite, at ease kind of ‘anything goes, all are welcome’ type of feeling is present on these streets. Like most Portland neighborhoods, Sellwood and Moreland neighborhoods feel very self-sustaining. Local grocery store New Seasons, many local coffee shops plus a few local coffee roasters make this community feel warm and a lot like its own small town. Walking the streets in Sellwood and Moreland neighborhoods invokes a “back in the good old days” feeling.

Belmont Street is a favorite destination for many locals, whether it’s for an afternoon at the Avalon Arcade, a night at the Blue Monk, or a cup of coffee at the neighborhood cafe. This area has a nice mix of urban diversity, with a funky feel, and local color. Funky, free, artsy, a bit grungy here and there and overall, very open. This is an indie business haven. The Sunnyside neighborhood is a mix of singles, families, hippies and urbanites. Think green, eco-friendly, front yards that are actually vegetable gardens, smart cars, car-free, funky home colors and decor.%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a[[Players.TheTriad|The Triad - Zhang Family]]%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*[[Players.AndreasHouseAndWorkshop|54 South-East Belmont Street]]%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Woodstock''%0a%0aThis is a lovely area of Portland with many nice older homes tucked into quiet neighborhood streets.

Some say that Southeast is where the “real” people live.Cross over the Willamette River from downtown and you’re in the Southeast’s Central Eastside Industrial District, home to the industrial plants that provide thousands of jobs for Portlanders. It’s also home to the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry.%0a%3c %0a%3c Many eastside residents take the Hawthorne Bridge (photo on the left) to enter the downtown area or leave it. This beautiful photograph of the bridge was taken by Adrienne Cleveland of Portland.%0a%3c %0a%3c Travel east from the Central Industrial District a mile or so and you’ll run into the Hawthorne area. The Hawthorne and nearby Belmont districts are filled with single-family homes and apartment buildings. Bakeries, coffeehouses, boutiques, music and bookstores, micro-pubs, and restaurants line the two streets.%0a%3c %0a%3c Southeast Portland’s Hawthorne Boulevard supports a thriving district that is full of activity. Here, high-density housing meshes with retail activity, creating one of the city’s more interesting shopping areas — pedestrian friendly, lined with gift stores, period clothing shops, eateries, and espresso shops.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25'''Big Burn of 1846'''%0a%3c %0a%3c In 1846, a forest fire that began on the slopes of Mt. Scott burned off most of the timber as far north as the Columbia River. This event had a profound effect on the settlement of the east side. Up until that year, much of the land east of the river was heavily wooded. The trees were soon replaced with coarse grasses. The area was so thoroughly cleared that the setting of farms was a simple matter not requiring the time-consuming and back-breaking job of clearing.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25'''Killing the Eastside Freeway and Preserving Urban Living'''%0a%3c %0a%3c One event defines Portland in the past 25 years! It was killing the Mount Hood Freeway, a 6-mile, eight-lane asphalt highway that would have vaulted across the Willamette River from Johns Landing to I-205.%0a%3c %0a%3c The story of the freeway’s demise is a lesson in what distinguishes Portland from other West Coast cities. Whereas most cities were building freeways after WWII, Portland was preserving neighborhoods. It gave us strong neighborhoods, proud schools and MAX (light rail). It cemented the region’s commitment to ecology and the reputation of a brilliant political leader, Neil Goldschmidt. Stopping the freeway not only saved 1,750 households in Southeast Portland from the wrecking ball, it also established Portland’s philosophy of urban livability-the idea that cities are for people, not just for commerce and cars.%0a%3c %0a%3c In 1975 Portland took the $500 million in federal highway aid and built the transit mall, eastside MAX and a host of neighborhood and suburban transportation projects, such as Eastman Parkway in Gresham and Cornell Road in Hillsboro. Most of the money went to the light rail system.%0a---%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

More country like than other surrounding neighborhoods, Ardenwald keeps a low profile. Filled with young families and old time residents, this community has an old fashioned feel. Home style varies and many sit on large lots with attached green spaces. For those that enjoy a rustic setting, then this may be the place for you. The neighborhood is populated with local small stores and a few family restaurants, but if you want variety, Ardenwald may not the place for you.

The neighborhood is home to several large-scale urban gardening projects, including the Brentwood Community Garden, which was improved and expanded in 2010 through a grant from The Home Depot and Fiskars.

Residents have plenty of coffee, pub and dining options just a stones throw away in most cases across several adjoining neighborhoods. Brooklyn is definitely a favorite and in-demand Portland neighborhood and feels very community friendly, safe and family focused. Dog walkers, runners, babes in strollers and people of all sorts busy the streets. Brooklyn, like most of its close-by sister neighborhoods, is fiercely independent and has a high number of locally owned businesses who thrive due to overwhelming local support. Brooklyn could easily be all things to all people: a laid back family oriented neighborhood, old trees and kids playing in the streets.

Residents have plenty of independent retail, coffee, pub and dining options just a stones throw away in most cases across several adjoining neighborhoods. Buckman and Kerns neighborhoods are also home to some of Portland’s finest micro breweries. Buckman’s Hawthorne District is one of the most unique, and most popular areas in Southeast Portland. The area is known for its wonderful restored old Portland homes, liberal residents, and fun and funky feel. The street is lined with unique restaurants and shops, and has a definite Portland-local flair.

It’s a nice area for families, but the age group is diverse. The Portland influence is not far away, as you can find a little bit of traditional mixed in with some funky, but it’s all very charming. There are several nice, older parks here, including Kenilworth Park and Creston Park, which has a pool and a dog park. Tree-lined streets give Creston-Kenilworth the atmosphere of a quiet neighborhood, even along busier roads. There is lots of shopping, especially to the Northeast, where businesses are mostly contained in strip malls. Unfortunately, some of these areas have experienced some crime over the past few years, though the neighborhood still feels very safe for families, especially during daylight hours.%0a%3c %0a%3c Neighborhood claimed by%0a%3c Link%0a%3c Average Resources%0a%3c &#9679;&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;%0a%3c Locations%0a%3c Link%0a%3c Link%0a%3c Link%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Eastmoreland%0a%3c Moreland is technically divided into two neighborhoods, Westmoreland (considered a part of the Sellwood-Moreland neighborhood by the City of Portland) and Eastmoreland. Eastmoreland features sprawling homes set back from the street on expansive lawns, with beautiful gardens. A canopy of mature trees lining the streets makes this an inviting and serene area to live. Reed College is located in the area, as is the beautiful Crystal Springs Rhododendron Garden, Eastmoreland Golf Course, and Berkeley Park. Eastmoreland feels a bit east coast with the larger colonial homes. There is a definite family friendly feel here. People seem active and community conscious here.

There is a very high concentration of recent immigrants with Foster-Powell being home to a large portion of Portland’s Russian and Ukrainian immigrants. There are some great authentic restaurants and shops in this neighborhood. A good mix of singles and families, renters and owners. This neighborhood is a good mix of people from all different walks of life and cultures.

As Kerns covers a fairly small urban area, there is not a lot of residential property within Kerns, but what there is consists of older east Portland homes—beautiful large, substantial homes with period charm and detail, many of which have been converted over the years into multi-family units and multiplexes. Portland four-squares and large Craftsman style bungalows line the streets, tucked into the more commercial areas. Kerns has many popular Portland restaurants and locally owned businesses, making this a fun neighborhood to visit. The Buckman - Kerns shops, bars, and restaurants along Burnside and 28th Avenue are some of the best in town. The Laurelhurst Theater is a great old classic theater for catching a movie. Buckman and Kerns neighborhoods are also home to some of Portland’s finest micro breweries. Kerns is considered to be urban, artsy, bike-friendly, green and eco-conscious.

This farmers market is really well outfitted with local vendors and is a staple of the community. Nearby Mt Tabor is a very popular park for hiking, biking and many other activities.

Urban, artsy, down-home, community minded, green and eco-conscious. Anti-car, some even anti-establishment. This is a neighborhood of families and young urbanites. As with the urban Portland trend, this neighborhood is very eclectic. Richmond homes vary substantially in form and style and, significantly, landscaping. Stuff just loves to grow here, as in all of Portland, but walking the streets one gets the definite sense that any neighborhood association that exists has long ago given up trying to beat back nature. Sidewalks are often shared, and “manicured” is not exactly a word that springs to mind.

Local grocery store New Seasons, many local coffee shops plus a few local coffee roasters make this community feel warm and a lot like its own small town.

This is a great area to look for a starter, first time home, or a nice family home in a pleasant neighborhood with plenty of shopping and conveniences nearby.

Belmont Street is a favorite destination for many locals, whether it’s for an afternoon at the Avalon Arcade, a night at the Blue Monk, or a cup of coffee at the neighborhood cafe. This area has a nice mix of urban diversity, with a funky feel, and local color. Funky, free, artsy, a bit grungy here and there and overall, very open. This is an indie business haven. The Sunnyside neighborhood is a mix of singles, families, hippies and urbanites.

Dog walkers, babes in strollers and bicyclers are a constant on the streets of Mt Tabor.%0a%3c %0a%3c Neighborhood claimed by%0a%3c Link%0a%3c Average Resources%0a%3c &#9679;&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;%0a%3c Locations%0a%3c Link%0a%3c Link%0a%3c Link%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Directory: Portland, Oregon - City of Roses%0a%3c Welcome to Portland	The Districts	City Map	Spheres	The Embassy%0a%3c %0a%3c Portland, OR %0a%3c Districts%0a%3c %0a%3c Changeling %0a%3c Player Guide%0a%3c %0a%3c Mage %0a%3c Player Guide%0a%3c %0a%3c Mortal %0a%3c Player Guide%0a%3c %0a%3c Vampire %0a%3c Player Guide%0a%3c %0a%3c Werewolf %0a%3c Player Guide%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
