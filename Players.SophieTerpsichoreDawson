She loves to wear bright colors and little black dresses. She often wears cute eye glasses but sometimes uses contact lenses. She can easily be seen in casual wear such as jeans and t-shirts too. She's very versatile in her appearance. She is an attractive girl and she's not afraid to use it when she wants, which is often hand in hand with her intelligence. %0a(:cellnr width=500 align=left:) %0a!!!%25center%25%25color=#ffd700%25''The Ensorcelled Traits''%0aTo the Ensorcelled and the Lost, Sophie's ears come to a point, appearing Elven in nature. Her hair is a bright pink, like a burning pink sunrise. She has small little fangs where her top canines are are. She also has a corona of white-ish pink around her body.%0a(:cellnr width=500 align=left:) %0a!!!%25center%25%25color=#ffd700%25''The Personality''%0aShe's a pretty curious and intelligent ambivert who loves being around other people's energy and having her own space to recharge her batteries in equal measure. She is ambitious in everything she does but she compartmentalizes every single role she takes on. Being exposed to the supernatural in her college years has transformed her teenage 'defender of the bullied' attitude into a genuine desire to see the supernatural world coexist with the mortal world. Watch out for that temper of hers though. You should be okay as long as you stay out of her way and you don't say or do the wrong thing. These days, she's traded in computer coding for dance training, throwing her passion back into the interests of her youth, a new fire burning inside of her fueled by recent heartache and loss.%0a(:cellnr width=500 align=left:) %0a!!!%25center%25%25color=#ffd700%25''Rumour Has It...''%0a*She's been Gifted since her teen years.
