Emberly is often warm and caring, an individual who desires not to hurt others. But, when she sees injustice or people being hurt - especially people she cares about - Emberly turns into a raging inferno, willing to burn everything away. She works to keep that part of her at bay, trying to find her life again without doing harm if she can get away with it.%0a> ----%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/28q1M6L.png%0a> %0a> ||! %25color=bd0202%25Image ||! %25color=ff5733%25Name ||! %25color=bd0202%25Relationship ||! %25color=ff5733%25Comment ||! %25color=bd0202%25Ringtone ||%0a> || %25thumb%25https://i2.wp.com/www.jasonmomoanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/DISCOVERY-FRONTIER-galleryjpg-700x480.jpg|| %25color=ff5733%25[[Conall Reese]] || %25changeling%25It's Complicated || %25color=ff5733%25He was the first I saw when I got free, and I'm blessed for that in so many ways.

Emberly is often warm and caring, an individual who desires not to hurt others. But, when she sees injustice or people being hurt - especially people she cares about - Emberly turns into a raging inferno, willing to burn everything away. She works to keep that part of her at bay, trying to find her life again without doing harm if she can get away with it.%0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25changeling%25https://i.imgur.com/GM61rtl.png%0a%3c %0a%3c ||! %25changeling%25Image ||! %25color=ff5733%25Name ||! %25changeling%25Relationship ||! %25color=ff5733%25Comment ||! %25changeling%25Ringtone ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i2.wp.com/www.jasonmomoanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/DISCOVERY-FRONTIER-galleryjpg-700x480.jpg|| %25color=ff5733%25[[Conall Reese]] || %25color=bd0202%25It's Complicated || %25color=ff5733%25He was the first I saw when I got free, and I'm blessed for that in so many ways.
