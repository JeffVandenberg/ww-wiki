Taller than most women, especially most Desi's, Emberly stands at 7" tall. She has long wavy black hair that falls over her shoulders, highlighting her full lips and strong cheekbones. Having only recently gotten free from the hedge, Emberly doesn't have much of a wardrobe - and possibly not much of a fashion sense - mostly wearing clothing that is ill fitted or baggy and usually from the mens' section. %0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25https://i.imgur.com/WQeXuJk.png%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #ff3a00' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=250px height=250px%25https://i.imgur.com/DFkvfq4.jpg%0aEmberly is no taller, but her light brown skin becomes grey and black, granite signed by the magma and fire beneath her hardened exterior. Cracks have splintered across her form, places where the magma has worn away at her body, across her chest and arms. Her eyes are molten fire, while her lips are burnt granit, opening to reveal the fire within her boyd. Her long red hair falls in streaks over her shoulders, while two horns grow out of her head and curve just a little back over it.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25https://i.imgur.com/gVkJ1qN.png%0a%0ahttps://i.imgur.com/N4KipGu.jpg%0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25https://i.imgur.com/hetrbrv.png%0a%0aEmberly is more often than not a big friendly and gentle giant, and often all too aware of how deadly her form is to most others, forcing her to be more than just a little mindful of others. Emberly is often warm and caring, an individual who desires not to hurt others. But, when she sees injustice or people being hurt - especially people she cares about - Emberly turns into a raging inferno, willing to burn everything away.

Taller than most women, especially most Desi's, Emberly stands at 7" tall. She has long wavy black hair that falls over her shoulders, highlighting her full lips and strong cheekbones. Having only recently gotten free from the hedge, Emberly doesn't have much of a wardrobe - and possibly not much of a fashion sense - mostly wearing clothing that is ill fitted or baggy and usually from the mens' section. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25%25changeling%25https://i.imgur.com/WQeXuJk.png%0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #005826' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=250px height=250px%25https://i.imgur.com/DFkvfq4.jpg%0a%3c Emberly is no taller, but her light brown skin becomes grey and black, granite signed by the magma and fire beneath her hardened exterior. Cracks have splintered across her form, places where the magma has worn away at her body, across her chest and arms. Her eyes are molten fire, while her lips are burnt granit, opening to reveal the fire within her boyd. Her long red hair falls in streaks over her shoulders, while two horns grow out of her head and curve just a little back over it.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25%25changeling%25https://i.imgur.com/gVkJ1qN.png%0a%3c %0a%3c https://i.imgur.com/N4KipGu.jpg%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25%25changeling%25https://i.imgur.com/hetrbrv.png%0a%3c %0a%3c Emberly is more often than not a big friendly and gentle giant, and often all too aware of how dealty her form is to most others, forcing her to be more than just a little mindful of others. Emberly is often warm and caring, an individual who desires not to hurt others. But, when she sees injustice or people being hurt - especially people she cares about - Emberly turns into a raging inferno, willing to burn everything away. She works to keep that part of her at bay, trying to find her life again without doing harm if she can get away with it.%0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25changeling%25https://i.imgur.com/GM61rtl.png%0a%3c %0a%3c ||! %25changeling%25Image ||! %25color=ff5733%25Name ||! %25changeling%25Relationship ||! %25color=ff5733%25Comment ||! %25changeling%25Ringtone ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i2.wp.com/www.jasonmomoanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/DISCOVERY-FRONTIER-galleryjpg-700x480.jpg|| %25color=ff5733%25[[Conall Reese]] || %25color=bd0202%25It's Complicated || %25color=ff5733%25He was the first I saw when I got free, and I'm blessed for that in so many ways.
