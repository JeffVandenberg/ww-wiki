These are the four steps on how to properly claim a neighborhood.%0a%0a*First, go to the districts page, and find which district and neighborhood you want to claim.  We only do claiming by the neighborhoods listed on here.  (We understand that there are many more, however there wasn't enough information on the web to fully flesh them out, so some got merged.)%0a*Second, make sure that no one else has claimed it.  Some areas have two staff run things like a changeling court and a founding family who both claim an area.  This is due to some ic agreement between the NPCs%0a*Third, make sure you have the right merits and all that stuff you need to claim the area.  Once you do, you're ready to make the request.%0a*Four, using the request system.  The group is Admin, the Request Type is Map Update.  Put in the link to the pc's wiki, or location, or PC group.  List what district and neighborhood you're claiming and then submit!%0a%0a!!%25center%25'''Location Wikis - PC Owned Locations'''%0a%0a%25red%25STOP%25%25 Before you begin working on a Location Wiki, ensure that you are sanctioned to do so. Many locations may require the purchase of a particular merit (i.e., Hollow, Sanctum, etc.), or may need to be part of your character's background (i.e., a character owned business). If its on your sheet, or you have the OK of your venue storytellers, then proceed.%0a%0a!!%25center%25'''Creating a Location Wiki'''%0a%0a*Identify in which district the location is. There are 12 districts. These can be identified on The City page at the bottom, and there is a map to help you decide where exactly you want your location to be.%0a*Once decided, use the Wiki Template maker located beside the banner of the District's page.%0a*It is not required that your location page use the wiki template, but it's a good start and helps people quickly identify aspects of the location.%0a*Your location wiki should, at the very least, identify what district it is in, who owns it (if this is IC knowledge), and any venue-related restrictions that may be in place.%0a*Go to [[City.Districts|Districts]] Wiki and find your District, from there click on the link for that page, edit and add it under one of the Location * in the proper neighborhood that your location is at.%0a*Go to Neighborhoods and same as above find your neighborhood, edit and add it under one of the Notable Places: * for that neighborhood.%0a**'+'''You may also ask AnneB to do this.'''+'%0a*If you'd like then use [[GameRef.LocationWikiTemplate|Location Wiki Template]]%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25'''Group Wikis'''%0a%0a*After you've created your group either a MCI or one of the PC based groups( IE: a Pack, Cabal, Motley, Coterie) and its been approved by staff you may use one of the templates below for your group!%0a%0a*[[GameRef.BroodTemplate|Brood Template]] %0a*[[GameRef.CoterieTemplate|Coterie Template]] %0a*[[GameRef.MotleyTemplate|Motley Template]] %0a*[[GameRef.MCITemplate|MCI Template]] %0a*[[GameRef.PackTemplate|Pack Template]] %0a%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25'''Player Wiki Templates'''%0a%0a!!!!!%25center%25%25red%25'''Attention Players.
