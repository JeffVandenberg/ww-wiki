At ST discretion, healing/restorative powers that are announced and the recipient is willing to receive might waive this.%0a*Powers altering/weakening/harming the Embassy itself, whether physically, temporally, spatially, spiritually, fate-wise, creating large scale illusions, or similar effects of any kind, or altering the space/time/fate/realm/etc of those within, will cause a Clash of Wills with the wards and needs a staff member present (or simply fails). If done for a hostile reason, the user is subject to being ‘shunted’ out (see below).%0a*Stealth power usage similarly requires a Clash of Wills against the entity, or it fails as soon as one enters the Embassy’s area of influence. If the power was being used for a hostile reason, they’re subject to being ‘shunted’, as described below.%0a*"Shunting:" Power usage done in any sort of ‘hostile’, ‘debilitating’, or even simply ‘debuffing’ manner will trigger the Entity’s wards. Whether the effect succeeds or fails, the intent becomes obvious to the Wards immediately after completion, and the perpetrator is teleported out of the Embassy (if needbe, it will Clash powers meant to prevent this; if it fails, it will ‘try again’ on subsequent turns until it wins). %0a**Extreme instances, such as attempting or succeeding at killing someone, or similar heinous offenses against Accord members or the Embassy itself, will involve being ‘shunted’ into a sort of internal ‘Labyrinth’ within the Embassy; these are closed off rooms and looping hallways that are outside of normal reality,and don’t touch upon typical realms. Teleportation can only get out of this if it’s capable of doing so through unknown realms, and requires a Clash as normal. Should someone end up in such a room, the Ambassadors will immediately become aware.%0a**Mundane hostile actions will cause the user to be shunted as soon as the hostility of it is ‘obvious’ to a theoretical neutral observer. Drawing a knife and pointing it at someone is enough to trigger it, for instance. Similarly, ‘intimidating’ actions meant to provoke or subdue will also cause this reaction.%0a%0a%0a(:tableend:)   %0a%0a(:include GameRef.Directorycity:)

At ST discretion, healing/restorative powers that are announced and the recipient is willing to receive might waive this.%0a%3c *Powers altering/weakening/harming the Embassy itself, whether physically, temporally, spatially, spiritually, fate-wise, creating large scale illusions, or similar effects of any kind, or altering the space/time/fate/realm/etc of those within, will cause a Clash of Wills with the wards and needs a staff member present (or simply fails). If done for a hostile reason, the user is subject to being ‘shunted’ out (see below).%0a%3c *Stealth power usage similarly requires a Clash of Wills against the entity, or it fails as soon as one enters the Embassy’s area of influence. If the power was being used for a hostile reason, they’re subject to being ‘shunted’, as described below.%0a%3c *"Shunting:" Power usage done in any sort of ‘hostile’, ‘debilitating’, or even simply ‘debuffing’ manner will trigger the Entity’s wards. Whether the effect succeeds or fails, the intent becomes obvious to the Wards immediately after completion, and the perpetrator is teleported out of the Embassy (if needbe, it will Clash powers meant to prevent this; if it fails, it will ‘try again’ on subsequent turns until it wins). %0a%3c **Extreme instances, such as attempting or succeeding at killing someone, or similar heinous offenses against Accord members or the Embassy itself, will involve being ‘shunted’ into a sort of internal ‘Labyrinth’ within the Embassy; these are closed off rooms and looping hallways that are outside of normal reality,and don’t touch upon typical realms. Teleportation can only get out of this if it’s capable of doing so through unknown realms, and requires a Clash as normal. Should someone end up in such a room, the Ambassadors will immediately become aware.%0a%3c **Mundane hostile actions will cause the user to be shunted as soon as the hostility of it is ‘obvious’ to a theoretical neutral observer. Drawing a knife and pointing it at someone is enough to trigger it, for instance. Similarly, ‘intimidating’ actions meant to provoke or subdue will also cause this reaction.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
