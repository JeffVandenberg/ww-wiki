Description%0a%0aTall and slender with a swimmer’s body and a look that screams that he is some ethnic mix that is not native to the area. Dark hair and usually dark eyes, the only strange thing is that from time to time those eyes seem to take on an unearthly, icy blue. What can be seen of his skin is generally always unblemished and smooth, though a bit dark for someone who can pass for white in most company.%0a%0aRemy is often seen wearing clothes that may have gone out of fashion 40 years ago, as of recently, the style of choice has been slacks and a button down dress shirt, with a vest over it all. With either a newsboy cap, fedora, or with no hat at all, Remy tends to turn heads, and knows that he does.%0a%0a'+The Art+'%0a%0a'''Back Piece'''%0a%0a*The tombstone is the center piece, flanked by Coffin statues on either side. The top hat hangs on the cross bar of a cross atop the tomb. The background is a swamp at night, trees hanging with skeletal branches that frame the tombstone.

Unfortunately, he lost most of his memory in a traumatic fight with the one who cursed him with his long living gift of Psychic Vampirism.  While he's starting to remember more and more of his past with meditation and the gifts of others, he's not too open about what he has regained of his memories.  What he does speak of, though, is at complete odds with the man he was during the War, and who he has shown himself to be.%0a%0aRemy grew up dirt poor, in a little shanty out on the bayou.  Dirt floors, wood stoves, and guns that were used for hunting down dinner or defending the house from riffraff who had an issue with the Cajun families living anywhere near polite society.  He doesn't talk of siblings, or his mother and father, just the shack, just the boat, just the Loa.  He was a practitioner of voodoo, with strong connections to Ghede/Baron Samedi, and enjoyed the benefits of such in the small community of practitioners, working and trading with them to survive out in the wilderness.%0a%0a'+Wartime Stories+'%0a%0a''If you would like to have had ties with Remy during the War of the Four, whether as rivals, friends, or acquaintances, please contact me in private.''%0a%0aWhile most people know the happy-go-lucky rogue that is Remy, what few do know is that he most certainly was not always that.  Coming to Portland in the the early 1950s, he stumbled right into the middle of the War of the Four.  As a mortal, and with the Rose City Guild not truly having formed to be the protective shelter that it is now within the city, he was forced to walk a razor's edge to keep himself, and those he cared about safe.%0a%0aWithin two years of coming to town, the Speakeasy was up and running, and Remy was creating a reputation for himself.  Some knew him as the 'Baron', for he walked that fine like between life and death, working with each faction, carefully, only showing force when absolutely needed, and making sure that each show of force was a lesson to at least one of the factions when it was done.  He rarely had an issue with the Wise or the Lost, but the Kindred and the Uratha seemed to take special interest in Remy and his dealings.%0a%0a'+Downtime at the Speakeasy+'%0a%0aThe Speakeasy is truly the one crowning achievement of Remy's, and it's seen it's fair share of use throughout the years.  From the smuggler tunnels that lead around parts of the city to allow access with secret panels, to the shop above it, Remy's taken his time to care for it properly, to the point one would imagine that it was his first love.  Parties, events, meetings, debates, negotiations...  All manner of things occur here, and Remy loves the fact that he can help it happen there.  In ages long gone, the Rose City Guild met there on occasion, a place to discuss things where there were rules, but not laws.  It continues on to this day, with Remy watching over the place and the proceedings with the keen eye of a man who loves the place with all his heart.%0a----%0a%0a!!

Coming to Portland in the the early 1950s, he stumbled right into the middle of the War of the Four.  As a mortal, and with the Rose City Guild not truly having formed to be the protective shelter that it is now within the city, he was forced to walk a razor's edge to keep himself, and those he cared about safe.%0a%3c %0a%3c Within two years of coming to town, the Speakeasy was up and running, and Remy was creating a reputation for himself.  Some knew him as the 'Baron', for he walked that fine like between life and death, working with each faction, carefully, only showing force when absolutely needed, and making sure that each show of force was a lesson to at least one of the factions when it was done.  He rarely had an issue with the Wise or the Lost, but the Kindred and the Uratha seemed to take special interest in Remy and his dealings.%0a%3c %0a%3c '+Downtime at the Speakeasy+'%0a%3c %0a%3c The Speakeasy is truly the one crowning achievement of Remy's, and it's seen it's fair share of use throughout the years.

Parties, events, meetings, debates, negotiations...  All manner of things occur here, and Remy loves the fact that he can help it happen there.  In ages long gone, the Rose City Guild met there on occasion, a place to discuss things where there were rules, but not laws.

Description%0a%3c %0a%3c Tall and slender with a swimmer’s body and a look that screams that he is some ethnic mix that is not native to the area. Dark hair and usually dark eyes, the only strange thing is that from time to time those eyes seem to take on an unearthly, icy blue. What can be seen of his skin is generally always unblemished and smooth, though a bit dark for someone who can pass for white in most company.%0a%3c %0a%3c Remy is often seen wearing clothes that may have gone out of fashion 40 years ago, as of recently, the style of choice has been slacks and a button down dress shirt, with a vest over it all. With either a newsboy cap, fedora, or with no hat at all, Remy tends to turn heads, and knows that he does.%0a%3c %0a%3c '+The Art+'%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Back Piece'''%0a%3c %0a%3c *The tombstone is the center piece, flanked by Coffin statues on either side. The top hat hangs on the cross bar of a cross atop the tomb. The background is a swamp at night, trees hanging with skeletal branches that frame the tombstone. The colors are black, with shades of blue and purple to resemble the night sky. The red on the top hat is a bright splash of color on the piece. The edges are ragged and unfinished, adding to the image.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Right Arm'''%0a%3c %0a%3c On his upper right arm, there is a stack of gold coins, the ink shows quite some age to the tattoo.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Left Arm'''%0a%3c %0a%3c On his upper left arm, there is a hand of cards, Aces over 8s, often called a Dead Man's hand.  The ink shows that it's probably his oldest tattoo.%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !! Rumor Has It...%0a%3c %0a%3c *Some say that you should be on your best behavior around Remy.  Something about eating souls?%0a%3c *If there's anything magic about him, it's his fingers.%0a%3c *Survived the War of the Four by being more ruthless than any others he came across.%0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !! From the Mouths of the Victors...%0a%3c %0a%3c '+Born on the Bayou+'%0a%3c %0a%3c Ask Remy where he grew up and all he can really say is "N'awlins, Ah guess.".  Unfortunately, he lost most of his memory in a traumatic fight with the one who cursed him with his long living gift of Psychic Vampirism.  While he's starting to remember more and more of his past with meditation and the gifts of others, he's not too open about what he has regained of his memories.  What he does speak of, though, is at complete odds with the man he was during the War, and who he has shown himself to be.%0a%3c %0a%3c Remy grew up dirt poor, in a little shanty out on the bayou.  Dirt floors, wood stoves, and guns that were used for hunting down dinner or defending the house from riffraff who had an issue with the Cajun families living anywhere near polite society.  He doesn't talk of siblings, or his mother and father, just the shack, just the boat, just the Loa.  He was a practitioner of voodoo, with strong connections to Ghede/Baron Samedi, and enjoyed the benefits of such in the small community of practitioners, working and trading with them to survive out in the wilderness.%0a%3c %0a%3c '+Wartime Stories+'%0a%3c %0a%3c ''If you would like to have had ties with Remy during the War of the Four, whether as rivals, friends, or acquaintances, please contact me in private.''%0a%3c %0a%3c While most people know the happy-go-lucky rogue that is Remy, what few do know is that he most certainly was not always that.  Coming to Portland in the the early 1950s, he stumbled right into the middle of the War of the Four.  As a mortal, and with the Rose City Guild not truly having formed to be the protective shelter that it is now within the city, he was forced to walk a razor's edge to keep himself, and those he cared about safe.%0a%3c %0a%3c Within two years of coming to town, the Speakeasy was up and running, and Remy was creating a reputation for himself.  Some knew him as the 'Baron', for he walked that fine like between life and death, working with each faction, carefully, only showing force when absolutely needed, and making sure that each show of force was a lesson to at least one of the factions when it was done.  He rarely had an issue with the Wise or the Lost, but the Kindred and the Uratha seemed to take special interest in Remy and his dealings.%0a%3c %0a%3c '+Downtime at the Speakeasy+'%0a%3c %0a%3c The Speakeasy is truly the one crowning achievement of Remy's, and it's seen it's fair share of use throughout the years.  From the smuggler tunnels that lead around parts of the city to allow access with secret panels, to the shop above it, Remy's taken his time to care for it properly, to the point one would imagine that it was his first love.  Parties, events, meetings, debates, negotiations...  All manner of things occur here, and Remy loves the fact that he can help it happen there.  In ages long gone, the Rose City Guild met there on occasion, a place to discuss things where there were rules, but not laws.  It continues on to this day, with Remy watching over the place and the proceedings with the keen eye of a man who loves the place with all his heart.%0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!

Hooks%0a%3c %0a%3c *Lets go Antiquing- Remy runs Darbonne Antiques, and is always on the lookout for a new deal. Buying or selling, he’s your man.%0a%3c *Not Quite Human- He has the feel of a predator about him, though not quite that of a vampire, or that of any of the other supernaturals. Those familiar with the idea of psychic vampirism might realize what he is, but he rarely brings up what he is in polite company.%0a%3c *Veteran of the War- Those with the age to know may vaguely remember him from his days during the War of the Four, or possibly you think it was his grandfather, as he doesn’t look a day over 25. He has the look though, that makes veterans think of the fact that he may have been there, for better or worse.%0a%3c *Emissary to the Kindred- Remy was recently appointed the Emissary between the members of the Rose City Guild and the Kindred Court of Portland. Have an issue, or want to try to get in touch with someone? Remy’s your man.%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!
