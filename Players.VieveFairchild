Her style of dress can best be described as bohemian - whatever colorful cast-offs she has last found that she's repurposed into something fun to look at. She's thin, a little bit too thin and sometimes looks a bit ragged in her face. But it's so easy to make her laugh, and smile, and no one's eyes are that naturally blue. She loves making an entrance and appearance, and always seems to be on the verge of a dance, or a song. Frequently, she will lose herself staring into a corner and need to be reminded that she lives in the present. %0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25werewolf%25'''Contacts'''%0a%0a||! %25werewolf%25Image ||! %25werewolf%25name  ||! %25werewolf%25relationship ||! %25werewolf%25 comment ||! %25werewolf%25Ringtone ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/pfYt8ti.jpg || %25werewolf%25[[Gwendolyn Bernhardt|Hart]] || %25werewolf%25 Cousin || %25werewolf%25My rock and Stability || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25werewolf%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/1XinTRu.jpg || %25werewolf%25[[Tempest Pax]] || %25werewolf%25Fangirl || %25werewolf%25Soul Sistah..ok, I fangirl a bit too much || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25werewolf%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.pinimg.com/originals/86/5a/25/865a25ce35a1b64dbea1d3abb05d8639.jpg || %25werewolf%25[[MaximilianAchillesBernhardt|Max Bernhardt]] || %25werewolf%25Cousin || %25werewolf%25Your faith in me is unshakable..and..probably..not..deserved. || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25werewolf%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/9KEVjL6.jpg || %25werewolf%25 [[Joel Wright|Joel]] || %25werewolf%25 Friend || %25werewolf%25I didn't expect to find you, but we're still finding things, aren't we? || %25newwin%25[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBr7bFvD6ZY|%25werewolf%25Stubborn Love]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/aTX49ym.jpg || %25vampire%25[[Michael Youssef|Michael]] || %25vampire%25Employer || %25vampire%25Confidant, Friend, and Batshit crazy enough to try to give me a chance. || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25vampire%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/WHwKuvQ.jpg || %25beast%25[[Joseph Cambersten|Joe]] || %25beast%25Friend || %25beast%25You really are a modern Orpheus, aren't you? || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25beast%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://soaphub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Nathan-Parsons.jpg|| %25mortal%25[[Knox Moore|Knox]] || %25mortal%25Blessing and Gift || %25mortal%25Had I seen This coming, I would have run far and away from you.

Her style of dress can best be described as bohemian - whatever colorful cast-offs she has last found that she's repurposed into something fun to look at. She's thin, a little bit too thin and sometimes looks a bit ragged in her face. But it's so easy to make her laugh, and smile, and no one's eyes are that naturally blue. She loves making an entrance and appearance, and always seems to be on the verge of a dance, or a song. Frequently, she will lose herself staring into a corner and need to be reminded that she lives in the present. %0a%3c %0a---%0a> %25center%25[Enter Here]%0a> %0a56c56%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.pinimg.com/originals/86/5a/25/865a25ce35a1b64dbea1d3abb05d8639.jpg || %25werewolf%25[[MaximilianAchillesBernhardt|Max Bernhardt]] || %25werewolf%25Cousin || %25werewolf%25Your faith in me is unshakable..and..probably..not..deserved. || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25werewolf%25Ringtone]] ||%0a---%0a> || %25thumb%25https://i.pinimg.com/originals/86/5a/25/865a25ce35a1b64dbea1d3abb05d8639.jpg || %25werewolf%25[[MaximilianAchillesBernhardt|Max Bernhardt]] ||%25werewolf%25Cousin || %25werewolf%25Your faith in me is unshakable..and..probably..not..deserved. || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25werewolf%25Ringtone]] ||%0a70,72c70,72%0a%3c !!!!%25werewolf%25 ''Former Substance Connossieur'': %0a%3c There are days and times in Vieve's past where she's been a friend to ever liquor label that crossed her path, and probably has needlemarks on her arms that are still healing.
