The young woman had an expression that could turn quickly from placid observation and curious wonderment to a sneering menace bereft of succor and cold black eyes like dead pools of water.  Nimble fingers were dotted with the red if irritation and speckles of black, as though they had been freshly scrubbed to extremes but still ink clung stubbornly to the ridges of fingers and nails. The exact structure of the short woman's build was obscured in loose, often over large and worn clothing accompanied by heavy sneakers that showed signs of being well broken in.  %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25left%25%25changeling%25''Mein''%0a%3c %0a%3c %25left%25The Rook lacked the substantial nature of most living beings, being composited form whisps of shadow, moonlight on smoke, and a ruddy red light.  The feathery edges of her hair flicker out to create tendrils of shadows that drift away into nothingness, their gloom drifting near her face casting darkness over the dull red glow of her eyes.  The living amalgam of darkness and light that comprised so much of her being, twined down her hands in an ever-changing labyrinth of whirls and tangles until it dripped from her fingers like an ichor that hinted at the razor-fine claws that could be deployed there.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25left%25%25changeling%25''The Dread Flock''%0a%3c %25left%25Six birds are always in close proximity to Rook, great black birds that appear to be corvids to most observers.  They either perch nearby on powerlines, circle overhead or peer in the windows.  To ensorcelled and fae eyes, the Flock are made of dizzying darkness, staring into them too long is nauseating or fascinating depending on your proclivities as subtle patterns and pinpricks of light are revealed, but there is an edge of the unreal in them and the promise of madness in their raucous cawing.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25left%25%25changeling%25''Mantle''%0a%3c %0a%3c %25left%25The looming sense of dread clings to her pale "flesh" like a perfume, mingling with the fall scents of dying leaves.

With a song in her heart, she will delightfully help others cultivate that fine emotion that the Autumns call their own.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''Help Wanted (anyone)'': %0a%3c Rook's life involves minimal upkeep, but she does still try and do odd jobs on occasion.
