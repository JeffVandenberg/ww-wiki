There is an almost innocent and vulnerable air to the young woman.  From the wide blue-green eyes that always seem to remind people of the ocean, to the way her hair always seems to fall across her face half hiding it.  She just seems to stir in people the desire to protect her.  But she is in very good physical shape, strong and agile in nature, all packed in a small frame.  Her dark brown hair is hardly ever contained and let to hang around freely, her skin seems sun kissed year around.  The odd thing is, she doesn't wear shoes unless forced too. It could be that she seems to have extra webbing between her fingers and her toes. Her mask teeth do look to be a little sharper than normal in appearance.   O typically wears bracelets of different kinds only on her right wrist.  More often then not a leather band that covers most of her wrist.  When she doesn't have on a bracelet, there is a stylized, 'glowing' R. With a glow slightly that makes her normal tan skin seem pale around it %25white%25She wears a [[https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQDZRCfiEoKfaNgQuL6pAI7vm4qjZu86ViJmZcEuJxK5OCjn0Kqyw|protection amulet]], it has a hedge thorn and a shark tooth, the shark tooth ontop of the triangle and the hedge thorn pointing downward under the shark tooth, both are bound down to the amulet by cold iron(Hedgethorn Amulet +3 and 8 again vs Fae Magic).%25%25 %0a%0a\\\%0a\\\%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='4px solid #DFB483' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=250px height=250px%25https://i.imgur.com/8j0EuMV.png%0a!! %25center%25https://i.imgur.com/SsuiFlr.png%0a%25center%25%25color=#7DF7F3%25The siren, every myth you've heard about beautiful women, singing and luring sailors to their deaths into the ocean?  Yup that is O..  In her mein her hair is longer, and gives off shimmers of rainbow colors as it moves.  Her eyes are still blue green in color.  But they change depending on her mood.  Running the whole range of blue and green colors.  Her fingers are webbed together almost completely.  Her feet are different, longer and webbed, they are sort of like flippers.  Her skin changes from sun kissed to a blue green, there is scales on her shoulders, arms and across her eyes like a mask.  Her ears are pointed as well.  The scales on her legs start about mid thigh and slowly cover her legs all the way down. But when she smiles wide, you can see her teeth have been replaced with [[https://i.imgur.com/XzIYUGN.jpg|sharks teeth]].  It's better to avoid the teeth all together, least you lose a digit.  Her teeth are razor sharp and pointed, and there is a waiting row of new teeth to replace the old exactly like a sharks. When on land and walking around her legs work just as they normally would in her mask.  But when she is in the water, she can pick to merge them together into a proper mermaid like tail.  The stylized 'glowing' R in her mein seems to glow around it faintly purple. %0a%0a!! %25center%25https://i.imgur.com/zWXPyEx.png%0a%25center%25%25color=#DFB483%25That feeling you get on the first break from the cold winter nights.  The sun warming your face, the hint of new plant life just starting to bud hanging in the air.  Animals making their first mating calls and the sound of young couples giggling flirtatiously.  That overwhelming feeling of hope, rebirth, regrow and the promise of young love.  Sometimes, memories are called forth, a day on the beach with friends.  When the water is still too cold, but the sun is nice and warm.%0a%0a----%0a%0a(:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a%0a(:cellnr width=100%25:)%0a%0a!! %25center%25https://i.imgur.com/kBTeiGZ.png%0a%0a%0a||! %25bg color=#7DF7F3%25Image ||! %25color=#DFB483%25Name ||! %25color=#7DF7F3%25Relationship ||! %25color=#DFB483%25Faction ||! %25color=#7DF7F3%25Comments ||%0a|| %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/8nIpOmJ.png|https://i.imgur.com/8nIpOmJ.png]] || %25color=#DFB483%25[[Christoph Smith]] ||  %25color=#7DF7F3%25Fiancee || %25color=#DFB483%25Changeling || %25color=#7DF7F3%25He saved her, he keeps her safe from herself and others.

I'm thankful to be included in that." - [[Alastair Bolte|Astar]]%0a%0a%25center%25%25changeling%25 "She's truly the only thing that matters..." - [[Christoph Smith|Chris]]%0a%0a%25center%25%25vampire%25 "I never forget my people." - [[WMustang|Mustang]]%0a%0a%25center%25%25mage%25 "O is as sweet as honey, and as comforting as velvet. She brings to others the most visceral of joys, family, friendship, a full stomach, a warm home, a song that settles your soul. Despite this if you foolishly dare to harm those she loves, you will find her ferocity, her willingness to sacrifice herself for the good of others. For these things I hold nothing but admiration for you and your beautiful soul." - [[AutumnAionAverlane|Autumn, the temporal siren.]] %0a%0a%25center%25%25changeling%25 "The worst thing to forget is family.  I am pleased that I have found it again.  I will hold her close and die before I allow harm to come to her.  She was kind to me before the truth was known to us and that will never be forgotten." - [[ConallReese|Grandbear]]%0a%0a%25center%25%25changeling%25 ''"When I was new she offered me a place to stay, friendship, and clothing to make me feel...like I was part of the world again. Her kindness can never be repayed, but my friendship, loyalty, and fire will always be hers. If anyone hurts her, I will hurt them."'' - [[Emberly Singh|Emberly]]%0a%0a%25center%25%25vampire%25 "Underestimate this gal at your own risk.

Yup that is O..  In her mein her hair is longer, and gives off shimmers of rainbow colors as it moves.  Her eyes are still blue green in color.  But they change depending on her mood.  Running the whole range of blue and green colors.  Her fingers are webbed together almost completely.  Her feet are different, longer and webbed, they are sort of like flippers.  Her skin changes from sun kissed to a blue green, there is scales on her shoulders, arms and across her eyes like a mask.  Her ears are pointed as well.  The scales on her legs start about mid thigh and slowly cover her legs all the way down. But when she smiles wide, you can see her teeth have been replaced with [[https://i.imgur.com/XzIYUGN.jpg|sharks teeth]].  It's better to avoid the teeth all together, least you lose a digit.  Her teeth are razor sharp and pointed, and there is a waiting row of new teeth to replace the old exactly like a sharks. When on land and walking around her legs work just as they normally would in her mask.  But when she is in the water, she can pick to merge them together into a proper mermaid like tail.  The stylized 'glowing' R in her mein seems to glow around it faintly purple. %0a%3c %0a%3c !! %25center%25https://i.imgur.com/zWXPyEx.png%0a%3c %25center%25%25color=#DFB483%25That feeling you get on the first break from the cold winter nights.

Yup that is O..  In her mein her hair is longer, and gives off shimmers of rainbow colors as it moves.  Her eyes are still blue green in color.  But they change depending on her mood.  Running the whole range of blue and green colors.  Her fingers are webbed together almost completely.  Her feet are different, longer and webbed, they are sort of like flippers.  Her skin changes from sun kissed to a blue green, there is scales on her shoulders, arms and across her eyes like a mask.  Her ears are pointed as well.  The scales on her legs start about mid thigh and slowly cover her legs all the way down. But when she smiles wide, you can see her teeth have been replaced with [[https://i.imgur.com/XzIYUGN.jpg|sharks teeth]].  It's better to avoid the teeth all together, least you lose a digit.  Her teeth are razor sharp and pointed, and there is a waiting row of new teeth to replace the old exactly like a sharks. When on land and walking around her legs work just as they normally would in her mask.  But when she is in the water, she can pick to merge them together into a proper mermaid like tail.

Yup that is O..  In her mein her hair is longer, and gives off shimmers of rainbow colors as it moves.  Her eyes are still blue green in color.  But they change depending on her mood.  Running the whole range of blue and green colors.  Her fingers are webbed together almost completely.  Her feet are different, longer and webbed, they are sort of like flippers.  Her skin changes from sun kissed to a blue green, there is scales on her shoulders, arms and across her eyes like a mask.  Her ears are pointed as well.  The scales on her legs start about mid thigh and slowly cover her legs all the way down. But when she smiles wide, you can see her teeth have been replaced with [[https://i.imgur.com/XzIYUGN.jpg|sharks teeth]].  It's better to avoid the teeth all together, least you lose a digit.  Her teeth are razor sharp and pointed, and there is a waiting row of new teeth to replace the old exactly like a sharks.

Running the whole range of blue and green colors.  Her fingers are webbed together almost completely.  Her feet are different, longer and webbed, they are sort of like flippers.  Her skin changes from sun kissed to a blue green, there is scales on her shoulders, arms and across her eyes like a mask.  Her ears are pointed as well.
