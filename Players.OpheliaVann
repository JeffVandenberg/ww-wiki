There is an almost innocent and vulnerable air to the young woman.  From the wide blue-green eyes that always seem to remind people of the ocean, to the way her hair always seems to fall across her face half hiding it.  She just seems to stir in people the desire to protect her.  But she is in very good physical shape, strong and agile in nature, all packed in a small frame.  Her dark brown hair is hardly ever contained and let to hang around freely, her skin seems sun kissed year around.  The odd thing is, she doesn't wear shoes unless forced too. It could be that she seems to have extra webbing between her fingers and her toes. Her mask teeth do look to be a little sharper than normal in appearance. %0a%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=25px margin-right=25px width=270px height=270px%25https://i.imgur.com/GgczmDB.jpg%0a!! %25center%25%25color=#008080%25Mein%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%25center%25The siren, every myth you've heard about beautiful women, singing and luring sailors to their deaths into the ocean?  Yup that is O..  In her mein her hair is longer, and gives off shimmers of rainbow colors as it moves.  Her eyes are still blue green in color.  But they change depending on her mood.  Running the whole range of blue and green colors.  Her fingers are webbed together almost completely.  Her feet are different, longer and webbed, they are sort of like flippers.  Her skin changes from sun kissed to a blue green, there is scales on her shoulders, arms and across her eyes like a mask.  Her ears are pointed as well.  The scales on her legs start about mid thigh and slowly cover her legs all the way down. But when she smiles wide, you can see her teeth have been replaced with [[https://i.imgur.com/XzIYUGN.jpg|sharks teeth]].  It's better to avoid the teeth all together, least you lose a digit.  Her teeth are razor sharp and pointed, and there is a waiting row of new teeth to replace the old exactly like a sharks. When on land and walking around her legs work just as they normally would in her mask.  But when she is in the water, she can pick to merge them together into a proper mermaid like tail.  %0a%0a----%0a%0a!! %25center%25%25color=#008080%25Contacts%0a%0a(:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a%0a(:cellnr width=360px:) %25lfloat width=150%25 https://i.imgur.com/8nIpOmJ.png%0a%25changeling%25[[Christoph Smith|The Lover]]\\%0a%25white%25 He saved her, he keeps her safe from herself and others.
