His antlers are thick and wide and consist of four large horns on each side, notably they are stained a bloody red colour. His skin that is visible tends to have a very thin layer of fur to it, though it is regularly marked and scarred from battle. His body posture and poise suggests a certain preparedness to leap to battle, and his eyes constantly dart to anything that might be moving.%0a%0a''Mask'': A blonde man, the sides of his head shaved, and the remaining hair is tied back, he has a moderate blonde beard. He stands roughly six foot 2 inches, and is broad shouldered. His general poise and gait implies someone with a good degree of self-confidence and little self-doubt. His eyes seem to always roam and scan a room as if assessing each person in turn.%0a%0a%0a!!Role Play Hooks%0a''Grimey Bars'' (All) - Can often be found in cheap and somewhat poor quality drinking establishments.%0a%0a''Farmer'' (Changeling) - Rumour has it, he runs a farm inside the hedge, and is wanting to expand it.%0a%0a“Norse” - He seems to enjoy competition in most forms even when he might know he’ll lose, he enjoys drinking (alot), and if you know him for long enough might even talk about the glory of death on the battlefield in order to reach Valhalla.%0a%0a!!Hooks for before the escape%0a''Arena Fighter'' - Back in the day, before he became a farmer, he used to be a fighter in his masters fighting pits. Did you two fight?%0a%0a''Viking'' - After fighting in the pits he and many others were sent to towns on the edges of the masters domain, they raided as much as they guarded and farmed. Were you a victim? An attacker? Something else encountered?%0a%0a!!Contacts%0aGwendolyn Morgan - Desanctioned%0a%0aConall Reese - Desanctioned%0a%0a!!Rumours%0aOnce urinated on a hedge slug that was being used as an APC by hobs when they invaded his farm - 15/7/2017%0a%0aGot shot trying to save another Changeling from Loyalists - 18/3/2018%0a%0a%0a!!Quotes%0a“That which does not kill me, should run.” [[Sylvester Eldridge]]%0a%0a“He told me not to hold back! He handled it pretty alright, though.” Penn%0a%0a“Sylvester is honorable to the point wherein his virtue alone addresses any lack around him; if Sylvester gives his word, then, it will be enough.” Lilou Chere%0a%0a“Guy’s an animal. A gorgeous, feral beast. Who would want to tame something of such exquisite beauty? Certainly not me. I wouldn’t mind owning him, though.” Lauren Hearst%0a%0a“I don’t know what I’ve done to deserve his kindness. I hope to always be worthy of your hospitality, Sylvester, for you have an honorable and courageous heart. Brighter than my own.” - The Warrior of Heart%0a%0a“I not bite! I Promise! Sorry used hurt hug..” - O, Tiny Jaws%0a%0a“I may be a fighter, but that man is a warrior. There is a much bigger difference than some people might think.” - Tiffany Summers%0a%0a“Funny how we give the people we care about the power to hurt us. A lot less funny what they do with that power. For all the ways he’s strong, I think I found his weakness.” - Layla%0a%0a"He's a fun time, a pretty face, and good with his hands.
