As it was, he most often looked as though he had scavenged his attire from the refuse bin behind the local donation centre. On special occasion he may bother to dress moderately fashionable with a faux-military styled jacket and clean pants. His long, dark hair was constantly flying away, straight and fine and unmanageable, unwilling to be tamed, and his fu manchu was more scraggly than tended. He refuses to wear shoes, and the perceptive may note his bare feet on occasion, though the excess of his floor-dragging hair helps to conceal them.%0a%0a%25center%25To human senses, he carries the odor of an unwashed body that seems to reflect his poor health, with a slight fruity aroma some may associate with diabetics.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Mein''%0a%0a%25center%25Tall and ghastly thin, with shaggy black fur. He has the narrow face and drooping ears of a sighthound, though the majority of his face was devoid of flesh, baring age-greyed bone, with tendrils of long fur on his bony chin. His empty eye sockets, nasal passages and throat seem a chilling black void darker than mere shadowing would suggest.%0a%0a%25center%25While his torso and arms were generally humanoid, his fur covered him in flowing sheets of varied length. From his wrists down, again his bones were bare to the world, cracked and clattering against one another with even the most subtle movement. His spine extends into a tail held at such an angle as to prevent it from dragging in the dirt behind him, and his shaggy black fur took on a life of its own eerie waves around him. His legs had deformed to resemble a canine, as well, the bones shortening and lengthening so he stood digigrade with a slight bend of his knees, their length draped in concealing curtains of black fur.%0a%0a%25center%25Recently, a change has overcome him. Now a black-purple fire seems to reside within him, seeping out from the cracks in his bones and giving strange life to his face. In his once void-empty sockets were now pinpricks of brilliance, a light that was different than what one typically considers light. And from his throat? A literal tongue of flame licks over his teeth and jaws. Teeth that seem just a bit sharper, and what seemed to be once blunt claws could be seen to have gained some measure of keenness as well. %0a%0a%25center%25His particular odor reflects his appearance in many ways- The animal scents of dog-fur and natural musk; the mouldy and moist turned earth associated with graveyards; the distinct nose tickling sweetness of decayed flesh; and the very faintest hints of a dusty old library.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Mantle''%0a%0a%25center%25Though Edsel has his own kind of ominous aire, this is even more intense as his Mantle cloaks him in a mysterious aura.

Around his figure, it seems parts of him may be fading into the Twilight, as though the mystical season calls him away, giving a sense of a flickering flame at once present and yet ephemeral. The rustling sound of dry pages being turned, or the shift of autumn leaves, could faintly be heard in the quiet, and very occasionally punctuated by a sudden howling gust that ruffles his fur.%0a

Now a black-purple fire seems to reside within him, seeping out from the cracks in his bones and giving strange life to his face. In his once void-empty sockets were now pinpricks of brilliance, a light that was different than what one typically considers light. And from his throat? A literal tongue of flame licks over his teeth and jaws. Teeth that seem just a bit sharper, and what seemed to be once blunt claws could be seen to have gained some measure of keenness as well. %0a%3c %0a44d40%0a%3c %0a

At odds with himself, he seems to have fallen from grace, once well-considered now a broken shell of himself. Withdrawn, as though he might rather have been left alone, the dart of his eyes anything but inviting.''%0a%3c %0a%3c '''''Mein:''''' Tall and ghastly thin, with shaggy black fur. He has the narrow face and drooping ears of a sighthound, though the majority of his face was devoid of flesh, baring age-greyed bone, with tendrils of long fur on his bony chin. His empty eye sockets, nasal passages and throat seem a chilling black void darker than mere shadowing would suggest.%0a%3c %0a%3c While his torso and arms were generally humanoid, his fur covered him in flowing sheets of varied length. From his wrists down, again his bones were bare to the world, cracked and clattering against one another with even the most subtle movement. His spine extends into a tail held at such an angle as to prevent it from dragging in the dirt behind him, and his shaggy black fur took on a life of its own eerie waves around him. His legs had deformed to resemble a canine, as well, the bones shortening and lengthening so he stood digigrade with a slight bend of his knees, their length draped in concealing curtains of black fur.%0a%3c %0a%3c His particular odor reflects his appearance in many ways- The animal scents of dog-fur and natural musk; the mouldy and moist turned earth associated with graveyards; the distinct nose tickling sweetness of decayed flesh; and the very faintest hints of a dusty old library.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''''Mask:''''' Undernourished, perhaps, with sunken eyes and cheeks, but not too terribly skeletal. Tall, awkwardly gaunt with an artist’s hands, he seems in need of a few burgers and a good workout plan. His skin lacked life, paper thin and almost blue around lips and nearing black around his eyes.%0a%3c %0a%3c He might have managed to look passable if he bothered with his appearance. As it was, he most often looked as though he had scavenged his attire from the refuse bin behind the local donation centre. On special occasion he may bother to dress moderately fashionable with a faux-military styled jacket and clean pants. His long, dark hair was constantly flying away, straight and fine and unmanageable, unwilling to be tamed, and his fu manchu was more scraggly than tended. He refuses to wear shoes, and the perceptive may note his bare feet on occasion, though the excess of his floor-dragging hair helps to conceal them.%0a%3c %0a%3c To human senses, he carries the odor of an unwashed body that seems to reflect his poor health, with a slight fruity aroma some may associate with diabetics.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!Role Play Hooks%0a%3c *''Black Shuck'' can sometimes be seen haunting dark streets and abandoned places, a massive black dog that seems to come from legend itself. Stories may say that it is an omen of death, and those who see it may not have long to live.%0a%3c *''Hauntings'', or simply the rumours of them, can draw him in. Perhaps simply to see what truth there is to them.%0a%3c *''Erudition'' and esoterica seem to drive him, and yet he has an almost violent aversion to academic institutions.
