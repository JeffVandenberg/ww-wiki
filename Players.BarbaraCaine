She has curly blonde hair that often falls to her shoulders, and orange eyes that reflect light like a wolves eyes would. She dresses for whatever occasion she's going to and whatever mood she's in. She often wears makeup, usually dark eyeliner paired with lip gloss. She's not a girl that fades into a crowd, often standing out either in what she wears or the way she smiles or how her curls tumble over each other in an effort to reach her cheeks first.%0a%0aBarbara has a few tattoos; corvids coming up from inky spills over the long thin scars that run up along the inside her forearm being the easiest to view. A heart shaped from fire on the small of her back. A cross on her left hand between her pointer finger and thumb. Over her heart is a new tattoo, the Barbie logo with her own kissprint dotting the i. Along her back are small circles pierced into her skin on either side of her back, running up the length of it, and fed through that are pink and black laces.%0a%0aThose that get to view her scars, find that the southern Rahu has been in more than a few fights. Aside from the scars on her forearms, she has a variety of scars that speak to that. Claw marks, bite marks, burns, knife wounds and even bullet scars make stories out of her flesh, often covered into tattoos or shown proudly. Barbara is not afraid of her stories, even if many of them aren't happy. There's a newer mark on her left wrist, stylized in the same way as the Renatus Dynasty seal.%0a%0a|| %25color=#fc8600%25Height:||5'6"|| %25color=#fc8600%25Weight:||110lbs|| %25color=#fc8600%25Complexion:||Tanned|| %25color=#fc8600%25Hair Color:||Blonde||%0a|| %25color=#fc8600%25Eye Color:||Orange|| %25color=#fc8600%25Date of Birth:||8/21/1995|| %25color=#fc8600%25Place of Birth:||Tennessee|| %25color=#fc8600%25Accent:||Southern||%0a|| %25color=#fc8600%25Build Type:||Skinny || %25color=#fc8600%25Scars:||Numerous|| %25color=#fc8600%25Tattoos:||Many || %25color=#fc8600%25Piercings:||Lip, Nose, others||%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/upsknoP.png%0aBarbara is not the brightest bulb in the box, at least not when it comes to book learning, but she's street smart and business savvy, and has a good eye for the right sort of mark. She's clever, and fun to be around so long as her hair trigger temper isn't set off, then she's swinging for the fences - and these days that trigger seems to be easier and easier to pull. Despite all of this, once Barbara decides to befriend someone and let them them just a little past the walls, she can be loyal to a fault. %0a%0a-----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/d46a7U9.png%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a-----%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/0yAQJcv.png%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #FF7654' margin-top=0px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=25px width=325px height=325px%25https://i.imgur.com/dMdPSFI.jpg%0a*'''%25color=#fc8600%25Temper (Anyone)''': Barbara is a spitfire, it's just the plain honest to god truth. Her temper is a quick hot burn, over almost as fast as it starts, but while she's angry...she's dangerous. %0a*'''%25color=#fc8600%25''Legitimate'' Business Owner (Anyone)''': Barbara has recently purchased a building for a club - more specifically a Burlesque Club. It seems on the up on and up but rumors suggest she might be using it as a front.%0a*'''%25color=#fc8600%25Up and Comer (Criminal Types)''': Barbara is starting her own prostitution ring inside her burlesque club.%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/5IYRAyD.png%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #FF7654' margin-top=0px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=25px width=300px height=300px%25https://i.imgur.com/NOof6N1.jpg%0a*'''%25color=#fc8600%25Kinslayer (Wolves)''': There's a story that goes round that Barbara killed her family. Or...at least some of it. She's not against talking about it, but there's a heavy sadness that follows that story like a dark cloud. Of late, that sadness has shifted to anger.%0a*'''%25color=#fc8600%25Bone Shadow (Wolves)''': She sure took her time, but rumor has it Bobbi Jo finally joined a tribe. Depending on your perspective it might be utterly surprising or completely typical, but she's done it. She, however, is not making a huge fuss of it.%0a*'''%25color=#fc8600%25Emissary to the Wise (Wolves, Mages)''': Asked to aid Charlie Caine while she was still alive, Barbara became her assistant, and in the time after her death, Barbara put to work all of her social skills to rise t the position. Barbara plans to carry on what Charlie began.%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/45LGVK0.png%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #FF7654' margin-top=0px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=25px width=250px height=250px%25https://i.imgur.com/UtGYa2X.png%0a*'''%25color=Fc8600%25Spirit Buddy (Wolves, Mages)''': Barbara has recently made a friend from the Hisil. She claims his name is Trash Panda. The racoon has taken to following Barbara everywhere she goes, often eating fruits - especially strawberries. It chitters at her and hisses, and sometimes the two get into growling contests. For those that know of her it's probably a little odd to see her being (for the most part) friendly with a spirit, but slowly she's growing fond of it. If one were to ask the racoon what his name was, he would say it's Steve-Bob. Barbara will not listen to such nonsense though.%0a%0a-----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/ZFxhqdF.png%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a-----%0a||! %25color=#fc8600%25Image ||! %25color=#fc8600%25Name ||! %25color=#fc8600%25Relationship ||! %25color=#fc8600%25Comment ||! %25color=#fc8600%25Ringtone ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/Kj0zFRg.jpg || %25werewolf%25[[Samuel Caine|Sammy]] || %25color=#fc8600%25Brother || %25color=#fc8600%25My big brother.

She claims his name is Trash Panda. The racoon has taken to following Barbara everywhere she goes, often eating fruits - especially strawberries. It chitters at her and hisses, and sometimes the two get into growling contests. For those that know of her it's probably a little odd to see her being (for the most part) friendly with a spirit, but slowly she's growing fond of it. If one were to ask the racoon what his name was, he would say it's Steve-Bob. Barbara will not listen to such nonsense though.%0a---%0a> *'''%25color=Fc8600%25Spirit Buddy (Wolves, Mages)''': Barbara has recently made a friend from the Hisil.

She has curly blonde hair that often falls to her shoulders, and orange eyes that reflect light like a wolves eyes would. She dresses for whatever occasion she's going to and whatever mood she's in. She often wears makeup, usually dark eyeliner paired with lip gloss. She's not a girl that fades into a crowd, often standing out either in what she wears or the way she smiles or how her curls tumble over each other in an effort to reach her cheeks first.%0a%3c %0a%3c Bobbi Jo has a few tattoos; corvids coming up from inky spills over the long thin scars that run up along the inside her forearm being the easiest to view. A heart shaped from fire on the small of her back. A cross on her left hand between her pointer finger and thumb. Over her heart is a new tattoo, the Barbie logo with her own kissprint dotting the i. Along her back are small circles pierced into her skin on either side of her back, running up the length of it, and fed through that are pink and black laces.%0a%3c %0a%3c Those that get to view her scars, find that the southern Rahu has been in more than a few fights. Aside from the scars on her forearms, she has a variety of scars that speak to that. Claw marks, bite marks, burns, knife wounds and even bullet scars make stories out of her flesh, often covered into tattoos or shown proudly. Bobbi Jo is not afraid of her stories, even if many of them aren't happy. There's a newer mark on her left wrist, stylized in the same way as the Renatus Dynasty seal.%0a%3c %0a%3c || %25color=#fc8600%25Height:||5'6"|| %25color=#fc8600%25Weight:||110lbs|| %25color=#fc8600%25Complexion:||Tanned|| %25color=#fc8600%25Hair Color:||Blonde||%0a%3c || %25color=#fc8600%25Eye Color:||Orange|| %25color=#fc8600%25Date of Birth:||8/21/1995|| %25color=#fc8600%25Place of Birth:||Tennessee|| %25color=#fc8600%25Accent:||Southern||%0a%3c || %25color=#fc8600%25Build Type:||Skinny || %25color=#fc8600%25Scars:||Numerous|| %25color=#fc8600%25Tattoos:||Many || %25color=#fc8600%25Piercings:||Lip, Nose, others||%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25https://i.imgur.com/Ushcg0z.png%0a%3c Bobbi Jo is not the brightest bulb in the box, at least not when it comes to book learnin', but she's street smart and savvy, and has a good eye for the right sort of mark. She's clever, and fun to be around so long as her hair trigger temper isn't set off, then she's swinging for the fences - and these days that trigger seems to be easier and easier to pull. Despite all of this, once Bobbi Jo decides to befriend someone and let them them just a little past the walls, she can be loyal to a fault. %0a%3c %0a%3c -----%0a%3c (:div2end:)%0a%3c %25center%25https://i.imgur.com/DqXSEyM.png%0a%3c (:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a%3c -----%0a%3c %25center%25https://i.imgur.com/0bPMYWt.png%0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #FF7654' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=325px height=325px%25https://i.imgur.com/dMdPSFI.jpg%0a%3c *'''%25color=#fc8600%25Temper (Anyone)''': Bobbi Jo is a spitfire, it's just the plain honest to god truth. Her temper is a quick hot burn, over almost as fast as it starts, but while she's angry...she's dangerous. %0a%3c *'''%25color=#fc8600%25''Legitimate'' Business Owner (Anyone)''': Bobbi Jo has recently purchased a building for a club - more specifically a Burlesque Club.

Of late, that sadness has shifted to anger.%0a%3c *'''%25color=#fc8600%25Bone Shadow (Wolves)''': She sure took her time, but rumor has it Bobbi Jo finally joined a tribe. Depending on your perspective it might be utterly surprising or completely typical, but she's done it. She, however, is not making a huge fuss of it.%0a%3c *'''%25color=#fc8600%25Emissary to the Wise (Wolves, Mages)''': Asked to aid Charlie Caine while she was still alive, Bobbi Jo became her assistant, and in the time after her death, Bobbi Jo put to work all of her social skills to rise t the position.
