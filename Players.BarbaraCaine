She has curly blonde hair that often falls to her shoulders and ice blue eyes. She dresses for whatever occasion she's going to and whatever mood she's in. She often wears makeup, usually dark eyeliner paired with lip gloss. She's not a girl that fades into a crowd, often standing out either in what she wears or the way she smiles or how her curls tumble over each other in an effort to reach her cheeks first.%0a%0a|| %25color=#44e1f9%25Height:||5'6"|| %25color=#61ffbf%25Weight:||110lbs|| %25color=#44e1f9%25Complexion:||Tanned|| %25color=#61ffbf%25Hair Color:||Blonde||%0a|| %25color=#44e1f9%25Eye Color:||Ice Blue|| %25color=#61ffbf%25Date of Birth:||8/21/1995|| %25color=#44e1f9%25Place of Birth:||Tennessee|| %25color=#61ffbf%25Accent:||Southern||%0a|| %25color=#44e1f9%25Build Type:||Skinny || %25color=#61ffbf%25Scars:||Numerous|| %25color=#44e1f9%25Tattoos:||Many || %25color=#61ffbf%25Piercings:||Lip, Nose, others||%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/9y5bu2i.png%0a*'''%25color=#44e1f9%25Right Arm''': A corvid coming out of an inky spill along her forearm, covering up the thin scar there.%0a*'''%25color=#61ffbf%25Left Arm''': A corvid coming out of an inky spill along her forearm, covering up the thin scar there.%0a*'''%25color=#44e1f9%25Right Side''': Nothing (yet)%0a*'''%25color=#61ffbf%25Left Chest''': Barbie Logo over her heart with her own kiss-print dotting the i.%0a*'''%25color=#44e1f9%25Left Side''': A large feather curling over her hip that breaks into corvids flying up along the swell of her breast.%0a*'''%25color=#61ffbf%25Upper to Mid Back''': An angel in chains with her head on her knees sitting around a pile of skulls.%0a*'''%25color=#44e1f9%25Lower Back''': Corset piercing with pink and black laces, tattoo of a heart on fire.%0a*'''%25color=#61ffbf%25Piercings''': Left nostril, ears (double pierced), lip, and three other more ''private'' piercings.%0a*'''%25color=#44e1f9%25Scars''': Long thin scars along her inside forearms. A variety of claw marks, bite marks, burns, knife wounds and bullet scars dot the landscape of her body, some of them cleverly covered by tattoos, but most left as signposts for stories she could tell, if she wished.%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/1duAD1Y.png%0aBarbara is not the brightest bulb in the box, at least not when it comes to book learning, but she's street smart and business savvy, and has a good eye for the right sort of mark. She's clever, and fun to be around so long as her hair-trigger temper isn't set off, then she's swinging for the fences - and these days that trigger seems to be easier and easier to pull. Despite all of this, once Barbara decides to befriend someone and let them just a little past the walls, she can be loyal to a fault. %0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/sfI3giV.gif%0a-----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/QbHT5Fw.png%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a-----%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/CpvAILN.png%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #44e1f9' margin-top=0px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=25px width=325px height=325px%25https://i.imgur.com/7eHAtTh.jpg%0a*'''%25color=#44e1f9%25Temper (Anyone)''': Barbara is a spitfire, it's just the plain honest to god truth. Her temper is a quick hot burn, over almost as fast as it starts, but while she's angry...she's dangerous. %0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/HiWOTke.png%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #61ffbf' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=150px height=150px%25https://i.imgur.com/0JsQHo2.jpg%0a*'''%25color=#61ffbf%25Kinslayer (Uratha)''': There's a story that goes round that Barbara killed her family. Or...at least some of it. She's not against talking about it, but there's a heavy sadness that follows that story like a dark cloud. The story, like her former Deed name, is one that's heard from time to time.%0a*'''%25color=#44e1f9%25Bone Shadow (Uratha)''': She sure took her time, but rumor has it Barbara finally joined a tribe. Depending on your perspective it might be utterly surprising or completely typical, but she's done it. She, however, is not making a huge fuss of it.%0a*'''%25color=#61ffbf%25Emissary to the Wise (Uratha, Mages)''': Asked to aid Charlie Caine while she was still alive, Barbara became her assistant, and in the time after her death, Barbara put to work all of her social skills to rise t the position. Barbara plans to carry on what Charlie began.%0a*'''%25color=#44e1f9%25The Valkyrie Brynhildr (Uratha)''': Barbara recently was sought out by the Valkyrja Mot and after completing her trials, joined their number. A few changes have followed, but most importantly there's a certainty about her that had not been there before. Her wolf fur is now snow-white and her eyes, both human and wolf, are ice blue.%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/WhuOc7p.png%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #44e1f9' margin-top=0px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=25px width=250px height=250px%25https://i.imgur.com/UtGYa2X.png%0a*'''%25color=#44e1f9%25Spirit Buddy (Wolves, Mages)''': Barbara has recently made a friend from the Hisil. She claims his name is Trash Panda. The raccoon has taken to following Barbara everywhere she goes, often eating fruits - especially strawberries. It chitters at her and hisses, and sometimes the two get into growling contests. For those that know of her it's probably a little odd to see her being (for the most part) friendly with a spirit, but slowly she's growing fond of it. If one were to ask the raccoon what his name was, he would say it's Steve-Bob. Barbara will not listen to such nonsense though.%0a-----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/LCL4R5p.png%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a-----%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #61ffbf' margin-top=0px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=25px width=250px height=250px%25https://i.imgur.com/pMCjlm5.jpg%0a*'''%25color=#61ffbf%25Defeated a Nest of Azlu''': Along with her pack (at the time) [[Resurrect10n]], Brynhildr helped wipe out a nest of Azlu. This just lead the group to a bigger problem involving a Queen.%0a*'''%25color=#44e1f9%25Aided in the Destruction of an Azlu Queen''': After her return to the city from being gone for awhile, Brynhildr helped several members of the city destroy an Azlu Queen.%0a*'''%25color=#61ffbf%25Fought a Guardian Spirit''': Along with her former pack, [[OrdoAbMysteria|Ordo ab Mysteria]], fought against the guardian spirit to accept its challenge and help keep up the spiritual barrier that bars the Pure from entering Portland. %0a*'''%25color=#44e1f9%25Fought a pack of Pure''': Going with her brother, [[SamuelCaine|Skin Painter]], Brynhildr tried to reason with a pack of Pure called the Hellhounds, when that failed she and her brother fought them but were ultimately kidnapped and later rescued by [[DanielRenatus|Daniel]], [[Mustang]], and [[LauraRenatus|Laura]]. She did rip the arm off of a Fire-Touched that injected her with drugs, however.%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #44e1f9' margin-top=0px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=25px width=250px height=250px%25https://i.imgur.com/EUAHCxf.png%0a*'''%25color=#61ffbf%25Stomped down on a Lust Spirit''': After a pimp smacked one of her girls, Skye, Brynhildr tracked him down and went to town on him and his buddies, and ultimately the spirit behind them. Now initiated into the Bone Shadows, Barbara enjoyed having a Tribe.%0a*'''%25color=#44e1f9%25Broken Tail''': Brynhildr found a scorpion host along with a few other city folk and proceeded to lay the smack down on it, when it stabbed her with it's stinger and poisoned her, Barbara was all too happy to snap it's tail off with a sickening snap. After that the beast chose to flee rather than to face the angry Rahu.%0a*'''%25color=#61ffbf%25Joined the Valkyrja Mot''': Having rightfully picked between two warriors and then faced a challenge from a Valkyrie, Barbara joined their ranks and earned her new deedname 'Brynhildr'.%0a*'''%25color=#44e1f9%25Cockroach Motel''': Out with [[DennisSullivan|Dennis]] for drinks, Brynhildr and others had their senses assaulted by a cockroach host. Brynhildr helped take the thing down with [[DennisSullivan|Den]], [[KenleyUnauthorizedKelly|Unauthorized]] and [[VrysSarkhet|Vrys]] before [[AlvaroSantoDomingo|Santo]] drown them with water.%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #61ffbf' margin-top=0px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=25px width=250px height=250px%25https://i.imgur.com/5nHBYRp.jpg%0a*'''%25color=61ffbf%25Tunnel Trouble''': Brynhildr went down into the underground with [[AaronSinEaterSiversten|Sin Eater]], [[SamuelCaine|Skin Painter]], [[JasonAdamantDaily|Adamant]], [[DennisSullivan|Dennis]], [[VrysSarkhet|Vrys]], [[AlvaroSantoDomingo|Santo]], [[MickChainBreakerWestbay|Chain Breaker]], [[BridgetNoxMurphy|Nox]], and [[SethHase|Seth]] to find the Beshilu nest down there. Dennis suggested a pincer attack, and so the group split up. Once ready to strike, Brynhildr viciously attacked one of the rats on watch, only to get mauled by a much larger rat. Eventually the little rats were taken down and as one of the big ones fell, they started to retreat. Adamant was able to trap and do them great damage, but the unexpected Cockroach Hosts that were there got away.%0a*'''%25color=#44e1f9%25Dead Man's Pass''': Brynhildr went up Deadman's Pass in the car with [[PennyPeacekeeperPrescott|Peacekeeper]], [[AaronSinEaterSiversten|Sin Eater]], [[DennisSullivan|Dennis]], in the truck she got for Peacekeeper. They wrecked but were saved by another wolf, Gregor, who helped fix them up. Up on the mountain Brynhildr faced down zombie animals and felled them with the help of [[MickChainBreakerWestbay|Mick]], Peacekeeper, Mackenzie, Sin Eater, Dennis, Gregor, Santo and [[LuxLovelace|Lux]]. Unfortunatley one of their own passed, [[ChristianBaptiste|Christian]] and Brynhildr saw to his funeral sometime after Chain Breaker brought him down from the mountain.%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #44e1f9' margin-top=0px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=25px width=250px height=250px%25https://i.imgur.com/aItwfGz.jpg%0a**'''%25color=#61ffbf%25Exorcism''': When [[PennyPeacekeeperPrescott|Peacekeeper]] asked Aftermath for help with trying out a ritual, Brynhildr and the others agreed. They helped Penny chase down a ridden so she could try out her exorcism, and it all went well until [[AaronSinEaterSiversten|Sin Eater]] got a little too hungry and started to lose control. The pack thought quickly with [[DennisSullivan|Dennis]] getting the prisoner out, while [[SamuelCaine|Skin Painter]], Brynhildr and Peacekeeper helped Sin Eater regain control.%0a*'''%25color=#44e1f9%25Getting Into the Basement''': Brynhildr and most of Aftermath made their way to Jynx Tavern, where the terrorist/cult cell met in the basement. They had to talk their way in but eventually managed after a few missteps. Finally down in the basement, they found a door that was locked but the owner claimed it had no lock on it. Barbara easily unlocked the door and pushed it open to find the area where they did the barrel making. Each of them found something interesting. In the end, they had Jynx call to let the police know what was down there, and they left. No Collette. No ass-kicking, but at least some knowledge.%0a-----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/q7GiKoM.png%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a-----%0a||! %25color=#44e1f9%25Image ||! %25color=#44e1f9%25Name ||! %25color=#44e1f9%25Relationship ||! %25color=#44e1f9%25Comment ||! %25color=#44e1f9%25Ringtone ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/lEnXsKJ.jpg || %25werewolf%25[[Dennis Sullivan|Den]] || %25color=#61ffbf%25 Boyfriend || %25color=#61ffbf%25I get him and he gets me, and that's the most amazing thing.

It chitters at her and hisses, and sometimes the two get into growling contests. For those that know of her it's probably a little odd to see her being (for the most part) friendly with a spirit, but slowly she's growing fond of it.

They had to talk their way in but eventually managed after a few missteps. Finally down in the basement, they found a door that was locked but the owner claimed it had no lock on it. Barbara easily unlocked the door and pushed it open to find the area where they did the barrel making. Each of them found something interesting. In the end, they had Jynx call to let the police know what was down there, and they left. No Collette. No ass-kicking, but at least some knowledge.%0a---%0a> **'''%25color=#61ffbf%25Exorcism''': When [[PennyPeacekeeperPrescott|Peacekeeper]] asked Aftermath for help with trying out a ritual, Brynhildr and the others agreed.

A heart-shaped from fire on the small of her back. A cross on her left hand between her pointer finger and thumb. Over her heart is a new tattoo, the Barbie logo with her own kiss-print dotting the i. Along her back are small circles pierced into her skin on either side of her back, running up the length of it, and fed through that are pink and black laces.%0a> %0a> Those that get to view her scars find that the southern Rahu has been in more than a few fights.

It chitters at her and hisses, and sometimes the two get into growling contests. For those that know of her it's probably a little odd to see her being (for the most part) friendly with a spirit, but slowly she's growing fond of it. If one were to ask the racoon what his name was, he would say it's Steve-Bob.

Along her back are small circles pierced into her skin on either side of her back, running up the length of it, and fed through that are pink and black laces.%0a%3c %0a%3c Those that get to view her scars, find that the southern Rahu has been in more than a few fights. Aside from the scars on her forearms, she has a variety of scars that speak to that. Claw marks, bite marks, burns, knife wounds and even bullet scars make stories out of her flesh, often covered into tattoos or shown proudly. Bobbi Jo is not afraid of her stories, even if many of them aren't happy. There's a newer mark on her left wrist, stylized in the same way as the Renatus Dynasty seal.%0a%3c %0a%3c || %25color=#fc8600%25Height:||5'6"|| %25color=#fc8600%25Weight:||110lbs|| %25color=#fc8600%25Complexion:||Tanned|| %25color=#fc8600%25Hair Color:||Blonde||%0a%3c || %25color=#fc8600%25Eye Color:||Orange|| %25color=#fc8600%25Date of Birth:||8/21/1995|| %25color=#fc8600%25Place of Birth:||Tennessee|| %25color=#fc8600%25Accent:||Southern||%0a%3c || %25color=#fc8600%25Build Type:||Skinny || %25color=#fc8600%25Scars:||Numerous|| %25color=#fc8600%25Tattoos:||Many || %25color=#fc8600%25Piercings:||Lip, Nose, others||%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25https://i.imgur.com/Ushcg0z.png%0a%3c Bobbi Jo is not the brightest bulb in the box, at least not when it comes to book learnin', but she's street smart and savvy, and has a good eye for the right sort of mark. She's clever, and fun to be around so long as her hair trigger temper isn't set off, then she's swinging for the fences - and these days that trigger seems to be easier and easier to pull. Despite all of this, once Bobbi Jo decides to befriend someone and let them them just a little past the walls, she can be loyal to a fault. %0a%3c %0a%3c -----%0a%3c (:div2end:)%0a%3c %25center%25https://i.imgur.com/DqXSEyM.png%0a%3c (:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a%3c -----%0a%3c %25center%25https://i.imgur.com/0bPMYWt.png%0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #FF7654' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=325px height=325px%25https://i.imgur.com/dMdPSFI.jpg%0a%3c *'''%25color=#fc8600%25Temper (Anyone)''': Bobbi Jo is a spitfire, it's just the plain honest to god truth. Her temper is a quick hot burn, over almost as fast as it starts, but while she's angry...she's dangerous. %0a%3c *'''%25color=#fc8600%25''Legitimate'' Business Owner (Anyone)''': Bobbi Jo has recently purchased a building for a club - more specifically a Burlesque Club. It seems on the up on and up but rumors suggest she might be using it as a front.%0a%3c *'''%25color=#fc8600%25Up and Comer (Criminal Types)''': Bobbi Jo is starting her own prostitution ring inside her burlesque club.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25https://i.imgur.com/cUXRDba.png%0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #FF7654' margin-top=0px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=25px width=300px height=300px%25https://i.imgur.com/NOof6N1.jpg%0a%3c *'''%25color=#fc8600%25Kinslayer (Wolves)''': There's a story that goes round that Bobbi Jo killed her family. Or...at least some of it. She's not against talking about it, but there's a heavy sadness that follows that story like a dark cloud. Of late, that sadness has shifted to anger.%0a%3c *'''%25color=#fc8600%25Bone Shadow (Wolves)''': She sure took her time, but rumor has it Bobbi Jo finally joined a tribe. Depending on your perspective it might be utterly surprising or completely typical, but she's done it. She, however, is not making a huge fuss of it.%0a%3c *'''%25color=#fc8600%25Emissary to the Wise (Wolves, Mages)''': Asked to aid Charlie Caine while she was still alive, Bobbi Jo became her assistant, and in the time after her death, Bobbi Jo put to work all of her social skills to rise t the position.
