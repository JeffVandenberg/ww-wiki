Unless otherwise identified here, the rules are as written in Chronicles of Darkness and 2nd Edition books.%0a%0a%0a!!%25center%25'''Custom Conditions'''%0a%0a:Positive: Note that exceptional successes on related supernatural powers can likely also provide these conditions%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Attuned''%0aYour character has gotten particularly well attuned to a certain, specific object, and has found that using it comes more easily than most. They gain 9-again on rolls involving it.%0a*''Possible Sources'': Exceptional success using or studying an object.%0a**''Resolution'': Fail a roll involving the object, don’t use the object for at least a day.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Resolute''%0aHaving stood up in the face of danger, oppression, or hostility from another, your character finds themself feeling unshakeable. They gain +2 on any Resolve or Composure rolls used to resist supernatural powers or social dice pools, and +1 for determining Doors for social maneuvering initiated while the character has this condition.%0a*''Possible Sources'': Exceptional success resisting a mental power or social roll, or on a resolve + composure roll.%0a**''Resolution'': Succumb to supernatural power, fail a resolve or composure roll, end up with the Shaken or Spooked condition, lose Willpower you didn’t spend yourself.%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25Empowered%0aYour character feels charged with supernatural power. Upon gaining this condition from a listed source, note that power. Upon successfully using that power, you may resolve this condition to gain an extra success on the roll. This does not work on contested abilities, however.%0a*''Possible Sources'': Exceptional success on a power activation roll or use of a (rolled) template ability.%0a**''Resolution'': Gain an extra success on a roll with that power as described above, fail a roll using that power.%0a***''Note'': This cannot be granted directly by magic or other powers unless they explicitly say they do; it’s by default only available when you roll an exceptional success on a power.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Alert''%0aYour character, while not quite on edge, is focused and alert, not easily distracted from the current situation. Perception rolls they make gain a +2 bonus, including rolls to notice an ambush or other surprise.%0a%0a*''Possible Sources'': Exceptional success on a Wits + Composure roll.%0a**''Resolution'': Fail a perception roll, get surprised, or leave the current location.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Prepared''%0aHaving done a bit of research or otherwise refreshed your memory of a named supernatural danger (such as Demons, Werewolves, or ghosts), you find yourself better able to face it. Attacks or other hostile actions of both mundane and supernatural nature from creatures of that type suffer a &#8722;2 penalty against you, and you get an exceptional success on 3 successes instead of 5 to evade or resist (but not attack) them.%0a%0a*''Possible Sources'': Exceptional success on Occult.%0a**''Resolution'': Fail a roll to resist the creature type’s powers, take lethal damage greater than your Stamina from the creature type, successfully defeat a creature of that type (whether in physical combat or some other challenge).%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Suspicious''%0aYou’ve noticed a lie or other dishonesty from a given character (attach their name to the condition), and they find it harder to trick you because of it. They suffer a -2 penalty on subterfuge, persuasion, or socialize actions against you, and you’re considered to have a step worse Impression in Social maneuvering initiated by them while you have the condition.%0a%0a*''Possible Sources'': Exceptional Success on Empathy or Subterfuge noticing a lie or other misdirection%0a**''Resolution'': Succumb to Social Maneuvering against the character, fail an empathy or subterfuge roll against them, or otherwise let them regain your trust.%0a%0a!!%25center%25'''Crossover'''%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Auras''%0a%0a*Vampires can sense Werewolves and Beasts as having a “Predatory Aura”, but realize they aren’t Vampires, to the range of their Kindred Senses. This does not beat powers concealing nature (including Passing Resemblance).%0a*Werewolves sense Vampires and Beasts with a successful, instant Wits + Primal Urge roll when close enough to smell one; again, this does not defeat powers concealing nature.%0a*Neither Vampires nor Werewolves can inherently sense Changelings (even predatory ones) through their aura due to the Mask (but see rules on the Mask below).%0a*Hunter’s Aspect can defend against Lashing Out and visa versa, and both can be used to defend against Bedlam. Bedlam can theoretically be used to defend against other auras too.%0a*All auras can be used to try and defend against supernatural powers that mention any other aura type as able to end it (e.g. Awe). This must be purposely done, however.%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Clash of Wills''%0a%0a*Whenever there’s no dice pool listed for a given situation, use Supernatural Tolerance (“Power Stat”) + Relevant Attribute. Mortals always just roll an Attribute.%0a*When using an Attribute in a Clash of Wills, only your ‘’base’’, permanent attribute rating applies, not anything temporary (or even 'indefinite', if the ability is still 'active') boosting it. Permanent, lasting changes (those not needing 'active' powers keeping it going) work normally.%0a*Ephemeral entities all roll Rank + Influence, as described for spirits in Werewolf: the Forsaken.%0a*Re-attempting a power usage (or another very similar power usage) after a lost Clash of Wills is subject to multiple action penalties (a -1 for each further attempt) for both the ensuing reactivation (if applicable) and the Clash dice pool itself. Only the one re-activating is subject to the penalty.%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Magic''%0a%0aCertain merits and abilities, such as Sorcerous Eunuch (SotC) reference ‘magic’ in general, rather than specific types of powers. However, the definition of magic often varies depending on the venue. The following rules apply, based on the 'source material' a given merit, power, or rules text comes from. Any notable exceptions will be listed below:%0a%0a*In Blue Books, Vampire, Beast, and Werewolf, merits/powers that provide protection against or affect ‘Magic’ in general, without referencing a specific type, protect against any power that’s activated with an extended action, one that requires a separate extended action first (like meditation), and anything that explicitly is called a ‘spell’ or ‘ritual’ in its description. This includes all Blood Sorcery, Obcasus Rites, and Wolf/Pack Rites, among other specific examples. This never applies to 'template' abilities, like a Werewolf's shifting.%0a*In Changeling, 'magic' is often interchangeable with 'supernatural', and so will affect or respond to any sort of supernatural ability. It will not, unless it specifically says so, affect 'template abilities' like a Vampire's Blood Bond or a Werewolf's shape-shifting.%0a%0aNote that text that talks about supernatural powers or abilities in other forms are unaffected by this; if it mentions the supernatural in general, even among talks of magic, it works more universally.  %0a%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''The Mask and ‘Mystical Senses’''%0a%0a*Kindred Senses only see past the Mask if related to what they normally reveal (life, blood), and ONLY reveal that aspect of the Mien. Abilities like Auspex can see through it more reliably.%0a*Wolf Senses allow the Mien to be smelled, but don’t reveal visual information.%0a*Beasts don’t see past the Mask without powers like Eyes of Heaven, but do sense Changelings normally with Family Resemblance.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Vampires and Supernatural blood''%0a%0a*Unnatural Affinity allows you to feed on the chosen type as if they had vampiric blood. It is not needed to feed on living supernaturals, but is needed for feeding on ephemeral entities.%0a*Supernatural blood has no special side effects unless a 2e book says otherwise.%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a%0a!!%25center%25'''Custom Items and Powers'''%0a%0a%25center%25'+%25red%25'''ANY''' custom item/power can only be developed after creation%25%25+' [[%3c%3c]]%0a%25center%25'+(''but you can start with public ones on the [[Custom Items And Powers]] wiki'')+'%0a%0a(:include GameRef.CustomItemsAndPowers#from6#to6:)%0a%0a%0a!!%25center%25'''General Equipment'''%0a%0aThese are pieces of equipment not from the book that will not need Rules Master approval if they follow the guidelines below, and will generally provide a dice bonus equal to half the Availability cost rounded up (similar to Fashion).%0a%0aAnything already in the book as example equipment of course supersedes this general equipment.%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Instruments''%0a:Equipment Bonus: +1 to +3 (Half the Availability spent on it)%0a:Availability: As above%0a:Size: Varies as appropriate%0a*Instruments represents any sort of musical instrument or similar tools used by performers. A guitar, drum set, magician's toolkit, and DJ setup all fall under this category, and provide the usual equipment bonus based on availability.%0a*At ST discretion, more bulky and complex setups may provide an additional +1 bonus (Max 3) compared to normal for its Availability.%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Laboratories''%0a:Equipment Bonus: +1 to +3 (Half the Availability spent on it)%0a:Availability: As above%0a:Size: A full room, or Size 2 if portable (see below)%0a*Laboratories covers a varied number of research oriented rooms and setups geared to a scientific or academic focus of some kind. When buying a Laboratory, choose a mental skill specialty ("Research" and similar skill-agnostic specs should also be tied to a specific skill); they apply their equipment to research and development oriented tasks that relate to that specialty.%0a*By decreasing the provided equipment bonus by 1 (for the same Availability), you can create "Portable" labs that can be used anywhere with maybe a few minutes of setup.%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Repositories''%0a:Equipment Bonus: +1 to +3 (Half the Availability spent on it)%0a:Availability: As above%0a:Size: Size 5 or so (a small bookcase) if physical, but digital Repositories are possible and have the size of their containing electronics.%0a*Repositories are similar to Libraries, but are generally highly specialized, representing less effort made in creating a widespread, accessible Library, and more towards getting everything that can be found about one very specific subject. When putting together a "general" repository, choose a category that could likely be represented with a mental skill specialty (other than "Research" or similar action-based specialties, of course); this topic is what its bonus applies to.%0a*As normal, Repositories may stack with Libraries, up to a total between them of +5.%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Workshops''%0a:Equipment Bonus: +1 to +3 (Half the Availability spent on it)%0a:Availability: As above%0a:Size: A full room, or Size 2 if portable (see below)%0a*Unlike Laboratories, which tend to be keyed to research and scientific discovery, workshops are tied to some sort of crafting or creation. Upon purchasing a Workshop, choose a crafting-related specialty (It needn't be a Crafts one; Supernatural Equipment as an Occult Specialty is acceptable, for instance, as would be "Music Composition" for Expression). Its bonus applies to any crafting rolls made that fall within that specialty.%0a*Like Laboratories, 'portable' workshops can be put together in a large bag and take a few minutes to setup in any room with enough space for the type of crafting being done.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Visual Artwork''%0a:Equipment Bonus: +1 to +3 (Half the Availability spent on it)%0a:Availability: As above%0a:Size: Varies as appropriate%0a*Visual Artwork represents many artistic endeavors that are meant to be set on display permanently and can otherwise be casually enjoyed solely with the sense of sight, not requiring a specific performance or a "run time" of any sort.%0a*The bonus is rarely tied to anything specific, and instead will apply to social bonuses for such things as socializing in its presence with someone who appreciates artwork, offering it as a gift, and so on. No specialization needs to be given, it just needs to be defined what exactly the Artwork is.%0a%0a%0aEquipment that provides higher bonuses, a more widespread area it applies to, or that similarly varies isn't banned, but does still need to go through the RulesMaster Request queue normally (Custom Item/Power) and likely will have some related trade-off. For instance, a Repository of 24/7 security footage might apply a larger bonus but ONLY for the sake of investigating one very specific location, and have a higher possible bonus for only that purpose.%0a%0aAs well, as a general rule, Crafting something costs 1 less Availability than purchasing it outright most times, although exceptions might be made in specific cases (many artistic endeavors, for instance).%0a%0aOther suggested options for General equipment should be sent in a Feedback request to the Rules Master group.%0a%0aOther preapproved equipment: %0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Protective Amulet''%0a:Equipment Bonus: +2%0a:Availability: •••%0a:Size: 1%0aProtective Amulets protect against either "magic" in general (representing all 'spells' and 'rituals'), or a specific type of creature's supernatural powers (like spiritual powers, for instance), chosen upon creation. The dice bonus applies to rolls to resist or contest the appropriate type of power. On an exceptional success (that isn't successfully contested) against the caster with that type of power, however, the amulet explodes, causing 1 Lethal damage. %0a%0a%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a%0a!!%25center%25'''General House Rules'''%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Integrity Traits and Sanctity of Merits''%0a%0aAny increases to Humanity or Integrity that are purchased with Experience are subject to sanctity of merits.%0a%0a:Example: If you purchase Humanity 8 at char gen and later drop to Humanity 7 - you will receive back the XP spent on the increase.  %0a%0a:Example: You are at Integrity 4 and you feel that your character has earned an increase to Integrity 5. You spend the XP for the increase. If you later fall back to 4, you will receive back your spent XP.%0a%0a:No XP will be given for drops in which no XP was spent, such as starting with Integrity 7 and dropping to Integrity 6:%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''[[City.MysteryCult|Mystery Cult]] Initiation''%0a%0aA character may only have a total of 6 dots assigned to different versions of this merit. %0aThe following [[City.MysteryCult|Cults]] do not count towards the limit for mortal characters, but may ICly limit membership in other groups: FHC LLC, Miami Infoship, Niqibat Al-Tijara, The Order of Saint Cervantes de Valladolid, and The Seventh.%0a%0a'''Benefits for MCIs are to be noted in the ''power notes section'' of the sheet and are ''not to be added onto the sheet'' with dots.'''%0a%0aInitiation may be in a setting-created Cults or Groups (See [[City.MysteryCult|Mystery Cults]]) or a player may create a new Cult (see below).%0a%0aUse the Notes section under Character Bio to identify the merit or skill benefits obtained by this merit, and the Sanctioning Staff will add them to your sheet during sanctioning.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Player-Created Cults''%0aTo have a custom [[City.MysteryCult|Mystery Cult]]  approved for play, submit the details (including Purpose, Relic (optional), and Doctrine, as described in the merit, ties to the setting, and basic associations of Initiation level with standing in the Cult) to the Rules Master, along with the Initiation benefits. After it has been approved mechanically, it must go through Story Master approval to make sure that it is a fit for the setting.%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25'''This should be done BEFORE character creation if not being created In Character.'''%0a%0a*Note that at least 3 PCs need to be involved in a Cult BEFORE being approved for play, with it being open to more members.  If the Cult ever falls below three members all remaining members lose access to the benefits of the cult until they recruit a third member again.  They may either leave the dots on the sheet and recruit IC or sanctity of merits them back to get a refund on XP but no one will be able to use the mechanical benefits without 3 active, sanctioned PC members.%0a%0a*All Cults need at least one member with 5 dots of Initiation, or a member with a merit like Primordial Cult (Beast) that implies cult leadership.%0a%0a*If approved, the Cult becomes a facet of the setting just like anything else, and may be made to have ties with existing or new NPCs, existing or future plots, other PCs, or the city’s Spheres, as the STM deems appropriate. The player will not always have 100%25 control over this, but their Initiation level will give them sway as appropriate. \\%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Merit: Status''%0a%0a*Status 1-2 can be purchased with Experience or starting merit dots, with Justification. Anything above that requires [[GamRef.Experience|Narrative Justification]], but does not need to be purchased. This does not apply to any other merit, like Mystery Cult Initiation or Mantle.%0a**Note that you must have Status purchased at 2 with XP to be able to earn a high-level position or otherwise raise to a higher status level, though you may do this at the "same time" as a position is offered IC, if applicable. %0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Strength Scores and Lifting''%0a%0a*Each dot in strength allows you to lift and carry something 25 lbs or less, push something 50 lbs or less, or push on wheels/rollers something that’s 250 lbs or less.%0a*For lifting, you’re able to lift more than this limit but you take a cumulative -1 penalty to Speed and all Physical rolls for every 25 lbs you carry in excess of your safe capacity.%0a*The second dot of the Strength Performance merit from Hurt Locker sets the lift/carry limit and the amount at which penalties apply to 40 lbs per dot of Strength, which also means your push limit becomes 80 lbs per dot and your push on wheels/rollers limit to 400 lbs per dot.%0a*The third dot of the Strength Performance merit doesn’t affect the lift/carry limit, but sets the push limit to 400 lbs per dot, and the push on wheels/rollers to 1600 lbs per dot.%0a%0a||! Strength ||! Lift/Carry ||! Push ||! Push on wheels/rollers ||%0a|| • || 25 || 50 || 250 ||%0a|| •• || 50 || 100 || 500 ||%0a|| ••• || 75 || 150 || 750 ||%0a|| •••• || 100 || 200 || 1000 ||%0a|| ••••• || 125 || 250 || 1250 ||%0a|| •••••• || 150 || 300 || 1500 ||%0a|| ••••••• || 175 || 350 || 1750 ||%0a|| •••••••• || 200 || 400 || 2000 ||%0a|| ••••••••• || 225 || 450 || 2250 ||%0a|| •••••••••• || 250 || 500 || 2500 ||%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Tilts''%0a*Stunned works off of the "Targeted Attacks" rule in various books, meaning the attack ''needs to target the head'' and do damage equal to or greater than the target's Size; ignore the "Causing the Tilt" entry in most books. The Stun Tag for weapons still works normally, as do powers or other abilities that explicitly cause Stunned. Damage sources that can't be targeted usually don't cause Stunned.%0a**Knockout Artist (Boxing, Hurt Locker) simply treats Size as 1 lower for targeted attacks to the head.%0a**Ippon (Grappling, Hurt Locker) allows the penalty (-3) be taken to cause Stunned, with the listed benefit calculating damage.%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25'''General Clarifications'''%0a%0a:Ephemera Summoning: When using an ability to summon ephemeral entities not represented by a merit on your sheet, staff is needed to summon anything of Rank 2+, or for any hostile (PvP) purposes. Obviously, you must be within the power’s range of a potential entity.%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Fighting Styles''%0a%0a:Weapon Prerequisites: When a fighting style or other merit/ability prerequisite relies on a weapon of a certain damage rating, use the weapon’s base rating in the case of magically or supernaturally enhanced items. (Example: A 1L knife with +3 damage due to being magical still counts as a 1L knife for the purpose of the Light Weapons fighting style)%0a%0a:Lethal Unarmed Damage: If you have a way to make your unarmed attacks do lethal damage, they do that instead of bashing for fighting styles saying you do a certain amount of bashing damage or improve bashing damage from unarmed attacks, so long as it makes sense for the lethal appendage(s) to be capable of the maneuver. %0aNote that per Hurt Locker, striking styles only work with normal human appendages, however.%0a%0a:Animal Forms: Fighting styles relying on human appendages will not work in animal forms.%0aPCs may gain the benefits from styles like K9 and Falconry if they can turn into that form and have specifically trained in it that way.%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Game Time frames''%0a%0aOne scene is one hour in downtime (but is just a scene as normal in-game), a chapter is a week, a story is a month, a chronicle is 3 months.%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Grappling''%0a%0a*Damage done via the Damage maneuver, as well as similar ‘success based’ maneuvers, like Feed, deal net successes in damage/blood/etc, not total.%0a*Activating powers can be done normally if reflexive, and if you win the grapple roll for instant actions.%0a:Clarifications: %0a*When grappled, you do not lose your first turn if you haven’t gone. You may still make a roll to ‘contest’ the initial grapple and try to escape, or do another action that the grapple wouldn’t prevent.%0a*When you get an exceptional success, using Break Free after another move does NOT give you another action unless the other maneuver was also reflexive.%0a*You may NOT choose the same maneuver twice with an exceptional success (e.g no damaging twice).%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Minor Power Usage''%0aWhen in casual 'coffee shop' type scenes, dice rolls and willpower/energy expenditures for minor, short term, casual usages of powers or innate abilities will typically not be enforced. Obviously, this should be nothing causing a lasting effect, harm to another, or that's resisted or contested in any way; such cases use the normal systems. This allows for simple things like using Telekinesis to float a drink over, for instance, without spending a point of Willpower.%0a%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Poison''%0a%0a:Clarifications: %0a*When in combat, all poisons inflict the Poisoned Tilt. It’s moderate for Toxicity 1–5, and Severe for Toxicity 6–10.%0a*Out of combat, if a given source of Toxicity doesn’t say otherwise, the damage dealt happens one time.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Hurt Locker''%0a%0a:Integrity Merits:%0a%0a*Support Network works for Integrity and Humanity.%0a*Scarred may only be taken for Integrity.%0a%0a:Violent Skills: Most of the Violent Skill uses are usable as is, though may need Narrator oversight when the need of an ST is mentioned.%0a**Occult Charms are capped at +/-5 in their effect, like equipment, but extra successes can always add extra days.%0a**Academics’ system for removing merits is tweaked slightly:%0a***The roll is made per week, not per day, and is Contested instead of Resisted; the target uses Resolve + Academics (or another skill if the ST deems it appropriate to the plan), with a target equal to twice the rating (without adding anything else, as it's a little easier to defend the status quo than to work against it). Rolls and results are made at the END of each week. The defender wins if there's a tie (as in both meet/exceed their target by the exact same amount in the same roll).%0a***Merits like Contacts (where appropriate to what's being targeted) will reveal what's going on to the character at the BEGINNING of the process.%0a***The plan MUST be detailed and make sense; if you have no actual idea HOW you could harm a given merit, you can't do it.%0a***'Personal' social merits like Striking Looks and Taste can't be targeted with this system.%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Social Maneuvering and PCs''%0aUse the systems described in Chronicles of Darkness, pg 82–83 with regards to using Social Maneuvering on other characters.%0a*Players decide the Impression others have with their character, but this should generally start as Average without other circumstances, and constant claims of Hostile impression for no good reason will be investigated by the staff.%0a*Supernatural powers that define or alter Impression somehow always supersede this.%0a%0a:Note: The examples in the books of simple instant rolls like intimidation or persuasion to make someone do what you want with a single success are meant as abstractions for unimportant NPCs, they do NOT force specific actions from PCs. However, they shouldn’t be entirely ignored; they evoke an emotional response, it just does not dictate action.%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Soul Loss''%0a%0aUse the systems in Vampire: the Requiem and the World of Darkness 2E: The God Machine Rules Update.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Specialties''%0a%0a*You may buy a specialty in a given power type (a specific Discipline, i.e. Auspex, for instance, or a specific Gift, like Elements) for a given skill, and this applies a bonus as normal. Similarly, any other specialty that might apply can affect power uses too.%0a*Remember that up to 3 different specialties may apply to a given skill roll.%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Touchstones''%0a%0a*Touchstones of any sort may not be of the same character type of the character that has it (A Vampire can not have a Vampiric Touchstone, for instance). If a Touchstone changes into that template, it counts as if they died.%0a*PCs may be Touchstones, and work normally, but must be approved by the other player, which may delay sanctioning. Werewolves may only take PCs as physical Touchstones.%0a*In the case of a character desanctioning without dying or otherwise being lost, a new Touchstone should be selected via request, but there’s no mechanical requirement or drawback for doing so.%0a*Mortals and half-templates are just about always suitable as Touchstones, even within the same venue.%0a*Other Supernaturals MAY be suitable as Touchstones, if they truly remind the character of their human side somehow, but this is generally rare, and needs Storymaster permission (along with the other player); in such cases, it should only be another PC.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Tilts''%0a*In the case of any merit or power that inflicts a scaled Tilt or Condition, if the writeup doesn't include a rating, assume it uses the minimum or lowest severity version. %0a*Where there's conflict between different versions of the same Tilt in various books, default to the Chronicles of Darkness 2e version, or the newer book if not in that core.   %0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25'''Merits'''%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Merits which grant Merits''%0a%0a*[[City.MysteryCult|Mystery Cult]] Initiation benefits ignore prerequisites when granting a ‘’specific’’ merit (or one of a set of specific merits), but cannot grant venue-specific merits to those not in it.%0a**With Storymaster and Rulesmaster permission when submitting the [[City.MysteryCult|MCI]] progression, merits may be rewritten slightly to accommodate a different venue or work universally. This should be done sparingly, and will not usually be approved for more than a single level of Initiation.%0a**If a character cannot benefit from a given level, they instead receive an appropriate number of dots of RELATED merits, and these replacement dots do NOT ignore prerequisites.%0a*Totems cannot grant merits from other venues (like Vampire merits or Supernatural merits) but otherwise ignore prerequisites. As above, if a member cannot benefit, they get replacement dots.%0a*No Merits that provide access to merits or similar traits at lower effective cost may ever provide access to OTHER merits that do the same or provide further cost breaks. For instance, you cannot have a Totem that provides Professional Training or Mystery Cult Initiation.%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Merits Shared By Multiple Characters''%0a*Mundane merits that appear with the "Motley" tag in Changeling can be combined by ''any'' group like any other shared merit. Merits with this tag, as of writing, that aren't already listed as shareable in other sources include Allies, Contacts, Resources, Retainer, Staff, and Status (mundane only)%0a*Merits representing the same sort of supernatural location stack with each other, and can be "shared" that way. For instance, Dedicated Locus stacks with Nest Guardian and Magical Nexus, so long as the latter two are taken to reflect that Locus.

When buying a Laboratory, choose a mental skill specialty ("Research" and similar skill-agnostic specs should also be tied to a specific skill); they apply their equipment to research and development oriented tasks that relate to that specialty. %0a%3c *By decreasing the provided equipment bonus by 1 (for the same Availability), you can create "Portable" labs that can be used anywhere with maybe a few minutes of setup. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25''Workshops''%0a%3c :Equipment Bonus: +1 to +3 (Half the Availability spent on it)%0a%3c :Availability: As above%0a%3c :Size: A full room, or Size 2 if portable (see below)%0a%3c *Unlike Laboratories, which tend to be keyed to research and scientific discovery, workshops are tied to some sort of crafting or creation. Upon purchasing a Workshop, choose a crafting-related specialty (It needn't be a Crafts one; Supernatural Equipment as an Occult Specialty is acceptable, for instance, as would be "Music Composition" for Expression). Its bonus applies to any crafting rolls made that fall within that specialty. %0a%3c *Like Laboratories, 'portable' workshops can be put together in a large bag and take a few minutes to setup in any room with enough space for the type of crafting being done. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25''Instruments''%0a%3c :Equipment Bonus: +1 to +3 (Half the Availability spent on it)%0a%3c :Availability: As above%0a%3c :Size: Varies as appropriate%0a%3c *Instruments represents any sort of musical instrument or similar tools used by performers. A guitar, drum set, magician's toolkit, and DJ setup all fall under this category, and provide the usual equipment bonus based on availability. %0a%3c *At ST discretion, more bulky and complex setups may provide an additional +1 bonus (Max 3) compared to normal for its Availability. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25''Repositories''%0a%3c :Equipment Bonus: +1 to +3 (Half the Availability spent on it)%0a%3c :Availability: As above%0a%3c :Size: Size 5 or so (a small bookcase) if physical, but digital Repositories are possible and have the size of their containing electronics.%0a%3c *Repositories are similar to Libraries, but are generally highly specialized, representing less effort made in creating a widespread, accessible Library, and more towards getting everything that can be found about one very specific subject. When putting together a "general" repository, choose a category that could likely be represented with a mental skill specialty (other than "Research" or similar action-based specialties, of course); this topic is what its bonus applies to. %0a%3c *As normal, Repositories may stack with Libraries, up to a total between them of +5. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Equipment that provides higher bonuses, a more widespread area it applies to, or that similarly varies isn't banned or anything, it will just need to go through me normally and likely will have some related tradeoff. For instance, a Repository of 24/7 security footage might apply a larger bonus but ONLY for the sake of investigating one very specific location, and have a higher possible bonus for only that purpose.%0a%3c %0a%3c As well, as a general rule, just so it's specifically stated, crafting something costs 1 less Availability than purchasing it outright most times, although exceptions might be made in specific cases (many artistic endeavors, for instance).%0a%3c %0a%3c If anyone has anything else they believe should fit in the general equipment category of "Simple dice bonus equal to half Availability", send in a Feedback request to the Rules Master group, please! %0a%3c %0a%3c [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a

However, we don’t want to entirely prevent ‘on the fly’ magic or Creative Thaumaturgy, so we’re implementing the following rules:%0a> %0a> *Creative Thaumaturgy may be performed in staff-run scenes ‘on the fly’, at the staff member’s discretion. Being allowed to perform a spell in a staff-run scene without it being finalized (see below), however, does '''NOT''' guarantee that it can be used again, as the mechanics will generally be simplified and made to suit the current situation.%0a> *Creative Thaumaturgy spells may be submitted to the “Rules Master” group via a “Custom Item/Power” request, where it will be discussed and balanced as needed. There’s no specific time limit between submissions, but please only submit CT for spells you’re capable of casting and actively plan to use.%0a> *Once approved, Creative Thaumaturgy spells will be made publicly available on the wiki, and can be cast and used by anyone as if they came from an official source.%0a> *If no staff is present, you may only perform approved and published spells in scenes.%0a> *Note that for now, only spells can be submitted, not custom Reach effects for published spells, to avoid difficulties cross-referencing.%0a> %0a> '''Exceptional Successes on Casting'''%0a> The listed option of ignoring all Withstand ratings on an exceptional success in spellcasting is not available.%0a> %0a> '''Pattern Restoration'''%0a> Pattern Restoration is not able to remove Conditions or Tilts that are supernatural in nature; they need to be removed with appropriate spells (or resolved normally).

Additionally, characters who fall under this classification can purchase Sleepwalker Merits.%0a> Character types who are considered Sleepwalkers (Note: Only 1 of the following is necessary):%0a> %0a> *Mortals who have purchased the Sleepwalker merit%0a> *Mortals who have purchased an “internal” Supernatural merit (Chronicles of Darkness)%0a> *Changelings, Vampires, Werewolves, Fae-touched, Ghouls, Wolf-blooded or any other supernatural template.%0a> *Ephemeral beings and similar ‘Non-Template’ entities, like Strix and Oneroi, do not count as Sleepwalkers for the purpose of related mechanics, but nor do they count as Sleepers for the sake of paradox.%0a> %0a> '''Unsafe Relinquishment'''%0a> Relinquishing a spell unsafely (with a willpower point) is an act of hubris at the Understanding level without an immediate need to. An inured spell is of course not affected by this.%0a> %0a> '''Clarification:''' Boons%0a> Fate spells that grant a boon cannot provide a Potency dice bonus to casting dice pools, even if the spell lists affecting spellcasting pools as its own Reach option. Dice Tricks (e.g 9-again) affect spellcasting normally if Reach is used.%0a> %0a> '''Clarification:''' Combined Spells%0a> Combined spells have the same factors (if their Primary differs, choose one), including specified targets/area, unless a Reach is spent to separate the Scale.%0a> %0a> '''Clarification:''' Nimbus Tilt%0a> Nimbus Tilts only affect those actively witnessing them, meaning those using Mage Sight (or other supernatural powers that can perceive it), or anyone when the Nimbus is deliberately flared; this also includes the offender when the Nimbus is used defensively.

Dramatic failure cannot be willingly taken, and an Exceptional success instead provides the Sated condition. If a Dramatic Failure is somehow naturally rolled, contact a Narrator.%0a> *The vitae gained from the weekly roll can be applied throughout the week rather than all at once.

Thrice Born Merit & Clarification%0a> %0a> ''Definition''%0a> A Thrice-Born is a wolf-blood with two very specific tells: Second Skin and Shadow Twin. The other component to being Thrice-Born is the culture in which their gifts are cultivated. Simply having the right combination of Tells is not enough. Thrice-Born are raised with duty and service to the Uratha and their culture. Thrice-born believe that they are a special part of Uratha culture, where the Wolf, the Man and the Spirit are born in separate, distinct forms. Because they have this unique perspective of what it is to be a servant of Luna, then they are duty bound to serve and fight.%0a> %0a> There are specific drawbacks and benefits to being a Thrice-Born. Thrice-Born are raised in a militaristic manner, a very hierarchical familial group who expects them to serve the Uratha as warriors, and scouts, and keeps their arcane education at the forefront of that. After all, sending the ignorant into battle is a surefire way to make sure they die first.%0a> %0a> They are expected to serve All Uratha as their assistance is called upon, and they are not allowed to pick and choose their battles. As they are servants to all, they will not get involved in conflicts between packs. They do not claim territory. They do not join packs, except with other Thrice-born or packs exclusive to their familial group, who understand the duty they must do.%0a> %0a> Thrice-Born Can and Do undergo the first change. Unlike other Wolfbloods, when the Thrice-born first changes into an Uratha, they will lose both Shadow Twin and Second Skin tells. They are no longer Thrice-Born, as those separate aspects have joined into one, complete being. As such, the other Thrice-Born will still pay them honor as having shared in their struggles and run as a servant, but will no longer count them among their numbers.%0a> %0a> !!!

This does not go without notice in the family and they talk of your praise. You gain 1 dot of resources as well as the access to the family’s Library. Your access to the library will increase as your status does, and provides an equipment bonus equal to Status: Hayes for appropriate research rolls.%0a> The Thrice Born has work to further the family and help Forsaken as well. You have really done your part to help as best you can. Ronald had noticed your work and wants to help you get stronger. You gain Favored Form at 2 dots for any form. (Note that only those Thrice Born with the family name may go above Status 3. There are very extreme circumstances for someone without the family name to move beyond this point.)%0a> You are now one of the top members of the family. There are not many of you, but if you got here, you deserved it, you worked for it with your own sweat and blood.

This stacks if Fortified Form is already taken for one form (Max of the 5 dot version)%0a> Disclosed. Only Ronald and his daughter Claire have this level of status at the moment.%0a> Drawback: Thrice born cannot take the Neighborhood merit as the Estate is all the family cares about.

They gain 9-again on rolls involving it.%0a%3c %0a%3c Possible Sources%0a%3c Exceptional success using or studying an object.%0a%3c Resolution%0a%3c Fail a roll involving the object, don’t use the object for at least a day.%0a%3c Resolute%0a%3c Having stood up in the face of danger, oppression, or hostility from another, your character finds themself feeling unshakeable. They gain +2 on any Resolve or Composure rolls used to resist supernatural powers or social dice pools, and +1 for determining Doors for social maneuvering initiated while the character has this condition.%0a%3c %0a%3c Possible Sources%0a%3c Exceptional success resisting a mental power or social roll, or on a resolve + composure roll.%0a%3c Resolution%0a%3c Succumb to supernatural power, fail a resolve or composure roll, end up with the Shaken or Spooked condition, lose Willpower you didn’t spend yourself.%0a%3c Hyper-Focus%0a%3c Separate from obsession, your character is incredibly focused on their current task (note it by the condition), to the exclusion of all others. Take a &#8722;2 penalty to all perception rolls, but you may expend this condition to make up to 2 additional rolls over the character’s current maximum for an extended action. This does NOT apply to extended supernatural power rolls.%0a%3c %0a%3c Possible Sources%0a%3c Exceptional success on an extended action, or to a roll preparing for one.%0a%3c Resolution%0a%3c Expend the condition as noted above, take damage, or dramatically fail a roll relating to the focus.%0a%3c Empowered%0a%3c Your character feels charged with supernatural power. Upon gaining this condition from a listed source, note that power. Upon successfully using that power, you may resolve this condition to gain an extra success on the roll. This does not work on contested or withstood abilities, however.%0a%3c %0a%3c Possible Sources%0a%3c Exceptional success on a power activation roll or use of a (rolled) template ability.%0a%3c Resolution%0a%3c Gain an extra success on a roll with that power as described above, fail a roll using that power.%0a%3c Note%0a%3c This cannot be granted directly by magic or other powers unless they explicitly say they do; it’s by default only available when you roll an exceptional success on a power.%0a%3c Alert%0a%3c Your character, while not quite on edge, is focused and alert, not easily distracted from the current situation. Perception rolls they make gain a +2 bonus, including rolls to notice an ambush or other surprise.%0a%3c %0a%3c Possible Sources%0a%3c Exceptional success on a Wits + Composure roll.%0a%3c Resolution%0a%3c Fail a perception roll, get surprised, or leave the current location.%0a%3c Prepared%0a%3c Having done a bit of research or otherwise refreshed your memory of a named supernatural danger (such as Demons, Werewolves, or ghosts), you find yourself better able to face it. Attacks or other hostile actions of both mundane and supernatural nature from creatures of that type suffer a &#8722;2 penalty against you, and you get an exceptional success on 3 successes instead of 5 to evade or resist (but not attack) them.%0a%3c %0a%3c Possible Sources%0a%3c Exceptional success on Occult.%0a%3c Resolution%0a%3c Fail a roll to resist the creature type’s powers, take lethal damage greater than your Stamina from the creature type, successfully defeat a creature of that type (whether in physical combat or some other challenge).%0a%3c Suspicious%0a%3c You’ve noticed a lie or other dishonesty from a given character (attach their name to the condition), and they find it harder to trick you because of it. They suffer a &#8722;2 penalty on subterfuge, persuasion, or socialize actions against you, and you’re considered to have a step worse Impression in Social maneuvering initiated by them while you have the condition.%0a%3c %0a%3c Possible Sources%0a%3c Exceptional Success on Empathy or Subterfuge noticing a lie or other misdirection%0a%3c Resolution%0a%3c Succumb to Social Maneuvering against the character, fail an empathy or subterfuge roll against them, or otherwise let them regain your trust.%0a63,93c73,75%0a%3c Vampires can sense Werewolves as having a “Predatory Aura”, but realize they aren’t Vampires, to the range of their Kindred Senses.%0a%3c Werewolves sense Vampires with a successful, instant Wits + Primal Urge roll when close enough to smell one.%0a%3c Neither Vampires nor Werewolves can inherently sense Mages (or Visa Versa) without specific powers.%0a%3c Hunter’s Aspect can defend against Lashing Out and visa versa, and both can be used to prevent a Nimbus Tilt, in place of the normal defense. Mages always reflexively defend with their Nimbus as described in Mage: the Awakening.%0a%3c All auras can be used to try and defend against supernatural powers that mention any other aura type as able to end it (for instance, Awe). This must be purposely done, however, it’s never reflexive. \\%0a%3c [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !! Clash of Wills%0a%3c %0a%3c Whenever there’s no dice pool listed for a given situation, use Supernatural Tolerance (“Power Stat”) + Relevant Attribute. Mortals always just roll an Attribute.%0a%3c Ephemeral entities all roll Rank + Influence, as described for spirits in Werewolf: the Forsaken. \\%0a%3c [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !! Magic%0a%3c %0a%3c Certain merits and abilities, such as ‘Deadpan’ (MtA) and Sorcerous Eunuch (SotC) reference ‘magic’ in general, rather than specific types of powers. In these cases, the following defines ‘magic’:%0a%3c %0a%3c Most merits that provide protection against or affect ‘Magic’ in general, without referencing a specific type, protect against any power that’s activated with an extended action, a power that takes longer than a turn to activate by default (even if it can be made to work quicker), and anything that explicitly is called a ‘spell’ or ‘ritual’ in its description.%0a%3c This includes all Supernal magic, all Blood Sorcery, and Rites, among other specific examples.%0a%3c Exception: Mage Spells that target ‘magic’ only affect Awakened magic by default unless it says otherwise. \\%0a%3c [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !! The Mask and ‘Mystical Senses’%0a%3c %0a%3c Kindred Senses only see past the Mask if related to what they normally reveal (life, blood), and ONLY reveal that aspect of the Mien. Auspex 1 (Beast’s Hackles) can reveal the Mien with a question like “What here is hidden behind illusion?”, or if another question would point out the Changeling. Auspex 2 (Uncanny Perception) reveals the Mien if “Is this person a supernatural creature?” is asked, or anything relating to illusion.%0a%3c Wolf Senses allow the Mien to be smelled, but don’t reveal visual information.%0a%3c Mages see past the Mask with Mage Sight, as well as with spells that reveal illusion or visual “truth”.%0a%3c Supernaturals can see past a strengthened mask with a Clash of Wills and the above methods.%0a---%0a> Clash of Wills%0a> Magic%0a> The Mask and ‘Mystical Senses’%0a95,118c77%0a%3c Unnatural Affinity allows you to feed on the chosen type as if they had vampiric blood. It is not needed to feed on living supernaturals, but is needed for feeding on ephemeral entities.%0a%3c Supernatural blood has no special side effects unless a 2e book says otherwise. \\%0a%3c [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !! Custom Items and Powers%0a%3c %0a%3c See Custom Items And Powers. Custom Magical Items and certain Supernatural Powers (see below) can be created anew by Player Characters using the following process:%0a%3c %0a%3c Submitted the proposed Item or Power to the Rules Master with suggested mechanics for approval:%0a%3c From the Request Tool create a Custom Item/Power type request for the Group: Rules Master.%0a%3c Use the Template for the type of item you’re creating (or if you’re making something completely new, use the recommendations in the book for information to provide)%0a%3c Privacy: The power/item should be listed as Public or Private in the writeup. Private means only the character that created it can use it, or those they’ve directly taught. Public means anyone may learn it (due to it being freely taught or the methodology spread around). Both will be listed on the wiki, for ease of access, but will have their ‘privacy’ noted.%0a%3c The Rules Master will then either approve it, work with the player to balance it out, or deny it if it simply can’t be done with the level or power(s) given.%0a%3c Once approved, the power or item must be developed IC:%0a%3c From the Request Tool create an Action type request for your Character Type’s Group.%0a%3c Attach the approved Custom Item/Power Request along with any development suggestions from the Rules Master.%0a%3c Specify in the request whether your character is hoping to build (i.e., craft) the item or power or retrieve the item or power.%0a%3c Power/Item types that provide a creation system in the books are created with the systems provided. In addition, a single scene or bluebook must be provided as Justification, involving some aspect of the creation process. Scenes do not need to involve an ST.%0a%3c Note: System required dice rolls should be attached to the request.%0a%3c In the case of power or item types that don’t have a concrete system, a number of Justifications must be provided equal to the level of the item/power. These can include scenes (with or without an ST), bluebooks, applicable merit uses (discussed with the Rules Master), and extended rolls (discussed with the Rules Master. Only successful rolls apply, of course). A scene or blue book MUST be one of the chosen Justifications.%0a%3c Retrieval: In the case of custom items that a character would like to ‘find’ or otherwise physically acquire in-character, the above Justification system is still used, representing the process of researching and seeking it out, but needing to involve a Scene run by an ST for actually acquiring the item (though this may be done via PRP). Retrievals are never Private.%0a%3c Once Justified, the item/power is sent back to the Rules Master for purchase (assuming you have the Experience), at which point it will be added to the wiki.%0a%3c Only one custom item/power may be submitted per month per character, no matter how long it takes to create it, and only one may be in ‘development’ at a time.%0a---%0a> Custom Items and Powers%0a120,131d78%0a%3c The following is a list, by Faction, of what can be custom-made with the above system. An * means that item can use the ‘retrieval’ system, and ** means they MUST be ‘retrieved’.%0a%3c %0a%3c Vampire: Devotions, Carthian Law, Invictus Oath, Scales of the Dragon, and Rituals.%0a%3c Carthian Law is inherently Public simply due to its often-external nature.%0a%3c Those with Protean 2/4 may submit Predatory Aspects and Unnatural Aspects without Justification or counting against the monthly limit, for now.%0a%3c Werewolf: Rites, Pack Tactics, Fetishes/Talens*.%0a%3c Changeling: Goblin Contracts, Tokens**.%0a%3c Goblin Contracts always cost 2xp, period, and should be balanced appropriately. This means they require 2 Justifications%0a%3c Mortal+: Supernatural Merits (Including those for ‘Micro’ templates).%0a%3c ONLY Mortals may create new supernatural merits; Others with means of learning them can learn those developed by mortals, but cannot create new ones themselves.%0a%3c Mages use the Creative Thaumaturgy systems listed in their own rules, and their magic items are similarly based off of spells/attainments and use those system; thus, they have no ‘monthly’ limit.%0a%3c All may submit ‘modifications’ for powers like Protean, Biomimicry, Chrysalis, and similar ‘animal aspect’ type abilities that allow you to gain modular benefits. This does not have a monthly limit, but again, please don’t submit for anything you can’t use.%0a133,137c80%0a%3c Mundane but still custom items are still submitted to the Rules Master for mechanical approval before the actual crafting roll is made, but no ‘Justifications’ are needed beyond what’s needed to get any materials needed for the item. Similarly, they are not limited to one per month. [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !! General House Rules%0a%3c %0a---%0a> General House Rules%0a139,198c82,86%0a%3c Mystery Cult Initiation benefits ignore prerequisites and type restrictions, except when a benefit relies on a trait or template ability that the character doesn’t have.%0a%3c Level 5 can provide a merit that’s essentially ‘rewritten’ for different traits, or that’s universally usable somehow, but other levels can’t.%0a%3c If a character cannot benefit from a given level, they instead receive an appropriate number of dots of RELATED merits; they must either be close to the benefit granted by that dot level, or thematically related to the cult, and these replacement dots do NOT ignore prerequisites or type restrictions.%0a%3c When a Totem grants merits, they can ignore prerequisites, but not type restrictions. If a Totem would grant a merit that a pack member cannot benefit from for that reason, this works the same way as if they had the ‘maximum’ rating, and they may take other benefits relevant to the Totem that Totem can normally grant.%0a%3c Replacement traits do not ignore prerequisites.%0a%3c Masques never ignore prerequisites.%0a%3c No Merits that provide access to other merits or similar traits at lower effective cost may ever provide access to OTHER merits that grant merits or other traits at lower cost. For instance, you cannot have a Totem that provides Professional Training, or take a Masque that grants Mystery Cult Influence.%0a%3c NEW Merit: Neighborhood (1–5)%0a%3c Prerequisite%0a%3c Neighborhood must be available or claimed by an agreeing, allied individual or group.%0a%3c When an individual or group has accrued enough status or the ability to claim and hold a Neighborhood as territory, they can then begin to develop the Neighborhood to work for them. This merit reflects an investment of time and effort to focus the mundane and potentially supernatural aspects of a Neighborhood towards the goals.%0a%3c Notification if any other individual or group is attempting to make a move on the territory. Perhaps a Neighborhood Watch has been established and strange faces cause a stir, or a general paranoia of being hunted has made the citizens of the Neighborhood overly cautious. Either way snooping or aggressive actions cause rumors.%0a%3c Select one skill. Everyone in the Neighborhood receives a +1 to dice pools involving that skill. Your actions or the actions of your group, whether positive or negative, have made certain things just a little easier for residents of your Neighborhood. However, others passing through also have access to this benefit.%0a%3c +1 Defense while in the Neighborhood. This is your turf. You know it and all the tricks and turns and the doors that will open and unlock. You know how to take advantage of the terrain to your benefit.%0a%3c Antagonists or Opponents receive a &#8722;1 to aggressive or threatening actions. You or your group are deeply entrenched in the Neighborhood. People may or may not know your face on sight, but your presence has instilled a deep territorial bent in everyone who lives in your Neighborhood. Anyone who tries to make a move against the Neighborhood will have some serious problems accomplishing it.%0a%3c Increase a bonus or a penalty to ± 3. Depending on what you or your group is attempting to accomplish in the neighborhood, you can choose which one of the previous dot benefits to improve.%0a%3c Increase an enemy’s penalties? The neighborhood starts to get very insular and distrustful of outsiders. They know who belongs and who doesn’t.%0a%3c Increase defense? The Neighborhood may or may not be more welcoming, but it has been honed as a defensive stronghold for you and your group. The residents will make protecting you a priority, even when other benefits could be had by putting their attention elsewhere.%0a%3c Increase a skill bonus? The neighborhood becomes well known for what it does best. Perhaps the University which supports a +3 to Academics starts to attract better teachers, smarter students, and more funding. Residential areas with a +3 to Larceny gain a reputation for being a rough place to live and attract gangs, etc.%0a%3c When requesting Neighborhood, the specify the merit note to be: Neighborhood Name (Group Name if applicable) for example: Neighborhood: Centennial (Leafy Bros). [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !! Merit: Mystery Cult Initiation%0a%3c %0a%3c A character may only have a total of 6 dots assigned to different versions of this merit.%0a%3c %0a%3c Initiation may be in a setting-created Cults or Groups (See Mystery Cults) or a player may create a new Cult (see below).%0a%3c Use the Notes section under Character Bio to identify the merit or skill benefits obtained by this merit, and the Sanctioning Staff will add them to your sheet during sanctioning.%0a%3c Player-Created Cults%0a%3c To have a custom Mystery Cult approved for play, submit the details (including Purpose, Relic (optional), and Doctrine, as described in the merit, ties to the setting, and basic associations of Initiation level with standing in the Cult) to a StoryMaster, along with the Initiation benefits.%0a%3c This should be done BEFORE character creation if not being created In Character.%0a%3c Note that at least 2 PCs need to be involved in a Cult for it to gain the mechanical benefits of Mystery Cult Initiation BEFORE being submitted, with it being open to more members.%0a%3c All Cults need at least one member with 5 dots of Initiation or Influence. This can be an NPC with Storymaster permission, but must be discussed with them.%0a%3c If approved, the Cult becomes a facet of the setting just like anything else (it’s not meant for simply adding on to a cabal/pack/other closed group), and may be made to have ties with existing or new NPCs, existing or future plots, other PCs, or the city’s Spheres, as the STM deems appropriate. The player will not always have 100%25 control over this, but their Initiation level will give them sway as appropriate. \\%0a%3c [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !! Merit: Status (1–5)%0a%3c %0a%3c Status can be gained in a combination of purchase via the merit or appointment to positions which confer status. For example, a Vampire character may gain the status of Sheriff which confers the status of 4 in the Court.%0a%3c %0a%3c Acknowledged Member - Can be purchased with XP.%0a%3c All characters receive 1 free dot of status in one Faction-specific group at Character Creation.%0a%3c Trusted Member - Can be purchased with XP.%0a%3c Respected Member, lower ranks of leadership - Can be obtained via position which confers status at no cost.%0a%3c Leader - Can be obtained via position which confers status at no cost.%0a%3c Indispensable Authority - Can be obtained via position which confers status at no cost.%0a%3c Note%0a%3c The role definitions listed above are rough guidelines that apply to most groups. Certain groups and/or player created groups (i.e., cults) may define the status dots differently. \\%0a%3c [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !! Psychokinetic Resistance%0a%3c %0a%3c Any non-mortal that has a way to learn Psychokinetic Resistance, through whatever means, will never be able to use it as a way to protect against their splat’s inherent ‘ weaknesses, or developed weaknesses like Vampiric Banes or Changeling Frailties. It simply provides no protection. \\%0a%3c [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !! General Clarifications%0a%3c %0a---%0a> NEW Merit: Neighborhood (1-5)%0a> Merit: Mystery Cult Initiation%0a> Merit: Status (1-5)%0a> Psychokinetic Resistance%0a> General Clarifications%0a200,257c88,93%0a%3c When using an ability to summon ephemeral entities not represented by a merit on your sheet, staff is needed to summon anything of Rank 2+, or for any hostile (PvP) purposes. Obviously, you must be within the power’s range of a potential entity. \\%0a%3c [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !! Fighting Styles%0a%3c %0a%3c Weapon Prerequisites%0a%3c When a fighting style or other merit/ability prerequisite relies on a weapon of a certain damage rating, use the weapon’s base rating in the case of magically or supernaturally enhanced items. (Example: A 1L knife with +3 damage due to being magical still counts as a 1L knife for the purpose of the Light Weapons fighting style)%0a%3c Lethal Unarmed Damage%0a%3c If you have a way to make your unarmed attacks do lethal damage, they do that instead of bashing for fighting styles saying you do a certain amount of bashing damage or improve bashing damage from unarmed attacks, so long as it makes sense for the lethal appendage(s) to be capable of the maneuver. Note that per Hurt Locker, striking styles only work with normal human appendages, however.%0a%3c Animal Forms%0a%3c Fighting styles relying on human appendages will not work in animal forms.%0a%3c PCs may gain the benefits from styles like K9 and Falconry if they can turn into that form and have specifically trained in it that way. \\%0a%3c [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !! Game Timeframes%0a%3c %0a%3c One scene is one hour in downtime (but is just a scene as normal in-game), a chapter is a week, a story is a month, a chronicle is 3 months. \\%0a%3c [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !! Grappling%0a%3c %0a%3c Damage done via the Damage maneuver, as well as similar ‘success based’ maneuvers, like Feed, deal net successes in damage/blood/etc, not total.%0a%3c Activating powers can be done normally if reflexive, and if you win the grapple roll for instant actions.%0a%3c Mages use the rules in their own book for spellcasting in a grapple.%0a%3c Clarification: When grappled, you do not lose your first turn if you haven’t gone. You may still make a roll to ‘contest’ the initial grapple and try to escape, or do another action that the grapple wouldn’t prevent.%0a%3c Clarification: Ties in grappling are re-rolled, but the initial roll is what determines level of success.%0a%3c Clarification: When you get an exceptional success, using Break Free after another move does NOT give you another action unless the other maneuver was also reflexive.%0a%3c Clarification: You may NOT choose the same maneuver twice with an exceptional success (e.g no damaging twice). \\%0a%3c [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !! Hurt Locker%0a%3c %0a%3c ‘Integrity’ merits%0a%3c Support Network works for Integrity, Humanity, Clarity, and Wisdom breaking points, but not Harmony.%0a%3c Scarred may only be taken for Integrity.%0a%3c Violent Skills%0a%3c Most of the Violent Skill uses are usable as is, though may need Narrator oversight when the need of an ST is mentioned.%0a%3c Academics’ system for removing merits works week by week instead of day by day, to reflect the flow of a chat game, and merits like Neighborhood can warn the target of such an attempt, as may others at Staff discretion. \\%0a%3c [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !! Merits Shared By Multiple Characters%0a%3c %0a%3c Merits benefits are capped at 5 unless the merit specifies a higher cap. If more than 5+ characters have purchased 1+ dots in a pooled Merit so that the total dots invested is greater than 5, the merit is still considered 5, unless it is a specific exception.%0a%3c In order to benefit from a pooled merit, a character must have purchased at least 1 dot of that merit - unless the merit says otherwise, or logically would apply anyway.

The latter requires Storymaster approval that your character has said ‘affinity’.%0a%3c Going deeper in, or to any area that’s expected to be dangerous even ‘nearby’ requires a staff member present (this can include someone running an approved PrP), as does going in if you lack affinity at all.%0a%3c As an exception, if a character who DOES have affinity is guiding no more than 1–2 others through the nearby area, and they have appropriate traits to do so (a specialty in navigating the area, for instance), no staff member is needed so long as the above rules are followed. \\%0a%3c [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!

If a Touchstone changes into that template, it counts as if they died.%0a%3c PCs may be Touchstones, and work normally, but must be approved by a Storymaster and the other player (the character doesn’t need to know what they are, though), which may delay sanctioning. Werewolves may only take PCs as physical Touchstones.%0a%3c In the case of a character idle-desanctioning or otherwise desanctioning without dying or otherwise being lost, a new Touchstone should be selected via request, but there’s no mechanical requirement or drawback for doing so.%0a%3c Mortals and half-templates are just about always suitable as Touchstones, even within the same Faction.%0a%3c Other Supernaturals MAY be suitable as Touchstones, if they truly remind the character of their human side somehow, but this is generally rare, and again, needs Storymaster permission (along with the other player); in such cases, it should only be another PC. \\%0a%3c [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!

Exotic Airs (• to •••••)%0a%3c %0a%3c The following rules are a temporary replacement for the missing ‘Exotic Airs’ merit in the Playtest%0a%3c Effect: Your character can harvest the emotions of some of the stranger creatures of the World of Darkness. Each dot of this Merit allows your character to gain Glamour from one type of supernatural creature. This may mean werewolves, ghosts, mummies, zombies, or stranger things still. The Glamour works the same way as if it had been harvested from a mortal. This DOES allow such characters to be Reaped, as well, but they may inherently make a roll to determine the source, and add their Supernatural Tolerance to it. %0a%3c Drawback: This advantage does not inherently mean the character is (more) able to interact with the chosen subject. For example, ghosts exist in an ethereal state, and their emotions tend to be dead and blunted.

However, we don’t want to entirely prevent ‘on the fly’ magic or Creative Thaumaturgy, so we’re implementing the following rules:%0a%3c %0a%3c Creative Thaumaturgy may be performed in staff-run scenes ‘on the fly’, at the staff member’s discretion. Being allowed to perform a spell in a staff-run scene without it being finalized (see below), however, does NOT guarantee that it can be used again, as the mechanics will generally be simplified and made to suit the current situation.%0a%3c Creative Thaumaturgy spells may be submitted to the “Rules Master” group via a “Custom Item/Power” request, where it will be discussed and balanced as needed. There’s no specific time limit between submissions, but please only submit CT for spells you’re capable of casting and actively plan to use.%0a%3c Once approved, Creative Thaumaturgy spells will be made publicly available on the wiki, and can be cast and used by anyone as if they came from an official source.%0a%3c If no staff is present, you may only perform approved and published spells in scenes.%0a%3c Note that for now, only spells can be submitted, not custom Reach effects for published spells, to avoid difficulties cross-referencing.%0a410d114%0a%3c The listed option of ignoring all Withstand ratings on an exceptional success in spellcasting is not available.%0a412,423c116%0a%3c Pattern Restoration is not able to remove Conditions or Tilts that are supernatural in nature; they need to be removed with appropriate spells (or resolved normally). It can remove mundane conditions/tilts that are applied because of supernatural powers, however (but if the power’s still active, this may be a Clash of Wills or it may just be re-applied).%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !! Sleepwalkers%0a%3c %0a%3c TO clarify, Sleepwalkers are not mechanically considered a “half-template” for the Mage venue regardless of how involved in the Mage venue the Sleepwalker may be.

However, the mage flaring the Nimbus is not affected by their own Tilt in any case.%0a433,434d121%0a%3c Merits and abilities that subtract from a type of power’s resisted dice pool instead raises Withstand by 1/2 the amount (round up) when dealing with spells.%0a%3c Merits and abilities that specifically treat the trait as higher just do exactly that.%0a436d122%0a%3c As listed in the Creative Thaumaturgy rules, Shielding spells will only protect against a number of supernatural effects equal to the spell’s potency for a given casting.%0a438,445c124%0a%3c Releasing Paradox always requires a staff member present to direct the paradox Reach; it’s recommended not to release paradox for downtime casting%0a%3c Internal Paradoxes require a staff member to be notified if more than 5 successes are rolled beyond what’s absorbed by Wisdom, as a new Paradox condition is likely to be needed.%0a%3c \\%0a%3c [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!

However, there are a few house rules in place to make it easier to manage in a chat environment, both for players and Storymasters:%0a%3c %0a%3c It’s assumed all Kindred hunt for an average of 1 Vitae per night in their downtime, to counteract the loss of Vitae from waking from daysleep, so Vitae pools don’t decrease over time by default. Players otherwise keep track of their own Vitae pools from night to night.%0a%3c Note: If under the effect of any power or circumstance that would prevent you from ‘casually’ feeding with normal mechanics, you do NOT get the nightly Vitae back in downtime; any feeding methodologies will need to account for the nightly loss.%0a%3c A Vampire PC’s player may make one hunting roll per chapter (Week), using the system for ‘feeding scenes with dice’ on VtR2e page 96. Dramatic failure cannot be willingly taken, and an Exceptional success instead provides the Sated condition. If a Dramatic Failure is somehow naturally rolled, contact a Narrator.%0a%3c The vitae gained from the weekly roll can be applied throughout the week rather than all at once. For example, if you are down 2 vitae and a hunt gains 6 vitae, 2 vitae can be applied immediately and 4 remaining can be used to replenish any other losses for that week.%0a%3c 1 vessel = 3 vitae (or 7 with a breaking point).%0a%3c Vitae gained In-Character from other PCs or ST-NPCs works normally and has no effect on hunting rolls or visa versa. You may not, however, gain Vitae from retainers or similar merits in this way; if they’re willing to provide blood to you, buy Herd.%0a%3c If there’s any confusion about something might be affected by this, ask a Narrator (if in a scene) or the Rules Master. \\%0a%3c [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!

In the case of normally ‘permanent’ abilities, they’re reflexively activated for a scene as one ‘use’. After these uses, the part rots away.%0a%3c To keep a Graft permanently, you must buy the Graft (• - •••••) merit, which is not available at Creation. The cost is equal to 1xp per dot level of the power being grafted; in the case of powers with no ratings, this will default to 3 and be adjusted up or down by the staff on a case by case basis (which will be recorded as they’re decided on)%0a%3c Grafting Unholy Flesh doesn’t work on ‘innate’ abilities like a Werewolf’s shapeshifting or a Mage’s Sight.%0a%3c As well, certain NPC-type powers, such as certain Dread Powers, rare Numina, and similar may not be graftable at StoryMaster and Rules Master discretion. This is in addition to the existing restrictions against taking template abilities.%0a%3c Traits unique to the ‘donor’ template type use the donor’s rating for all dice pools and derived effects. Attributes, skills, and other trait types the Vampire DOES have access to use their own ratings (other than the grafted power rating itself, of course).%0a%3c If using this Scale to gain a Mage’s power, you choose from their Praxes or Rotes, not Arcana, though individual Attainments can be taken one for one as normal. Similarly, it can’t be used to gain Blood Sorcery dots, but can be used for individual Rituals.%0a%3c You must always submit an Action request when using this Scale, and keep track of the Health levels of any relevant parts.

The other component to being Thrice-Born is the culture in which their gifts are cultivated. Simply having the right combination of Tells is not enough. Thrice-Born are raised with duty and service to the Uratha and their culture. Thrice-born believe that they are a special part of Uratha culture, where the Wolf, the Man and the Spirit are born in separate, distinct forms. Because they have this unique perspective of what it is to be a servant of Luna, then they are duty bound to serve and fight.%0a%3c %0a%3c There are specific drawbacks and benefits to being a Thrice-Born. Thrice-Born are raised in a militaristic manner, a very hierarchical familial group who expects them to serve the Uratha as warriors, and scouts, and keeps their arcane education at the forefront of that. After all, sending the ignorant into battle is a surefire way to make sure they die first.%0a%3c %0a%3c They are expected to serve All Uratha as their assistance is called upon, and they are not allowed to pick and choose their battles.

They do not join packs, except with other Thrice-born or packs exclusive to their familial group, who understand the duty they must do.%0a%3c %0a%3c Thrice-Born Can and Do undergo the first change. Unlike other Wolfbloods, when the Thrice-born first changes into an Uratha, they will lose both Shadow Twin and Second Skin tells. They are no longer Thrice-Born, as those separate aspects have joined into one, complete being. As such, the other Thrice-Born will still pay them honor as having shared in their struggles and run as a servant, but will no longer count them among their numbers.%0a%3c %0a%3c NEW Wolfblooded ONLY Merit: THRICE BORN (**)%0a%3c Wolfblood Only Merit - to be listed publicly on wiki and sheets %0a%3c Prerequisites: Shadow Twin (Tell), Second Skin (Tell) %0a%3c Optional: Family Status-Hayes%0a%3c %0a%3c Benefits%0a%3c The Thrice Born Merit identifies a Blooded as a Thrice-Born.

(Note: only if the change happens IC. This does not apply to Uratha who started the game as changed Thrice-Born. This applies to characters created after this merit was implemented, and will not be applied to current characters who have thrice-born in their background, OR to characters who started the game thrice-born and underwent the first change.

Upon gaining this condition from a listed source, note that power. Upon successfully using that power, you may resolve this condition to gain an extra success on the roll. This does not work on contested or withstood abilities, however.%0a> %0a> Possible Sources%0a> Exceptional success on a power activation roll or use of a (rolled) template ability.%0a> Resolution%0a> Gain an extra success on a roll with that power as described above, fail a roll using that power.%0a> Note%0a> This cannot be granted directly by magic or other powers unless they explicitly say they do; it’s by default only available when you roll an exceptional success on a power.%0a> Alert%0a> Your character, while not quite on edge, is focused and alert, not easily distracted from the current situation.

Mages always reflexively defend with their Nimbus as described in Mage: the Awakening.%0a> All auras can be used to try and defend against supernatural powers that mention any other aura type as able to end it (for instance, Awe).

Status: Hayes Family%0a%3c %0a%3c Requirements: Thrice Born and/or Last name Hayes%0a%3c %0a%3c Ronald Hayes has indoctrinated you into the family. You gain access to use the family Locus freely. This also comes with free housing at the Hayes family estate as well as a family that will back you up through thick and thicker.%0a%3c You did something of note that even the Forsaken talks about. This does not go without notice in the family and they talk of your praise. You gain 1 dot of resources as well as the access to the family’s Library. Your access to the library will increase as your status does, and provides an equipment bonus equal to Status: Hayes for appropriate research rolls.%0a%3c The Thrice Born has work to further the family and help Forsaken as well. You have really done your part to help as best you can. Ronald had noticed your work and wants to help you get stronger. You gain Favored Form at 2 dots for any form. (Note that only those Thrice Born with the family name may go above Status 3. There are very extreme circumstances for someone without the family name to move beyond this point.)%0a%3c You are now one of the top members of the family. There are not many of you, but if you got here, you deserved it, you worked for it with your own sweat and blood. Hayes and other higher members of the family teach you why the Thrice-born are not to be trifled with. They are not just money and family, they are fierce warriors as well. You can access to Fortified Form (3 dot version) for whichever form you choose. You must still meet the requirements of Fortified Form to use it. This stacks if Fortified Form is already taken for one form (Max of the 5 dot version)%0a%3c Disclosed. Only Ronald and his daughter Claire have this level of status at the moment.%0a%3c Drawback: Thrice born cannot take the Neighborhood merit as the Estate is all the family cares about. Thrice Born within the family shall not form packs with non-Thrice Born and Hayes family members.%0a%3c %0a%3c Exiled members can not take Status Hayes family but may take the Neighborhood merit.%0a%3c \\%0a---%0a> Clash of Wills%0a> Whenever there’s no dice pool listed for a given situation, use Supernatural Tolerance (“Power Stat”) + Relevant Attribute. Mortals always just roll an Attribute.%0a> Ephemeral entities all roll Rank + Influence, as described for spirits in Werewolf: the Forsaken. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Magic%0a> Certain merits and abilities, such as ‘Deadpan’ (MtA) and Sorcerous Eunuch (SotC) reference ‘magic’ in general, rather than specific types of powers. In these cases, the following defines ‘magic’:%0a> %0a> Most merits that provide protection against or affect ‘Magic’ in general, without referencing a specific type, protect against any power that’s activated with an extended action, a power that takes longer than a turn to activate by default (even if it can be made to work quicker), and anything that explicitly is called a ‘spell’ or ‘ritual’ in its description.%0a> This includes all Supernal magic, all Blood Sorcery, and Rites, among other specific examples.%0a> Exception: Mage Spells that target ‘magic’ only affect Awakened magic by default unless it says otherwise. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> The Mask and ‘Mystical Senses’%0a> Kindred Senses only see past the Mask if related to what they normally reveal (life, blood), and ONLY reveal that aspect of the Mien. Auspex 1 (Beast’s Hackles) can reveal the Mien with a question like “What here is hidden behind illusion?”, or if another question would point out the Changeling. Auspex 2 (Uncanny Perception) reveals the Mien if “Is this person a supernatural creature?” is asked, or anything relating to illusion.%0a> Wolf Senses allow the Mien to be smelled, but don’t reveal visual information.%0a> Mages see past the Mask with Mage Sight, as well as with spells that reveal illusion or visual “truth”.%0a> Supernaturals can see past a strengthened mask with a Clash of Wills and the above methods.%0a> Vampires and Supernatural blood%0a> Unnatural Affinity allows you to feed on the chosen type as if they had vampiric blood. It is not needed to feed on living supernaturals, but is needed for feeding on ephemeral entities.%0a> Supernatural blood has no special side effects unless a 2e book says otherwise. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Custom Items and Powers%0a> See Custom Items And Powers. Custom Magical Items and certain Supernatural Powers (see below) can be created anew by Player Characters using the following process:%0a> %0a> Submitted the proposed Item or Power to the Rules Master with suggested mechanics for approval:%0a> From the Request Tool create a Custom Item/Power type request for the Group: Rules Master.%0a> Use the Template for the type of item you’re creating (or if you’re making something completely new, use the recommendations in the book for information to provide)%0a> Privacy: The power/item should be listed as Public or Private in the writeup. Private means only the character that created it can use it, or those they’ve directly taught. Public means anyone may learn it (due to it being freely taught or the methodology spread around). Both will be listed on the wiki, for ease of access, but will have their ‘privacy’ noted.%0a> The Rules Master will then either approve it, work with the player to balance it out, or deny it if it simply can’t be done with the level or power(s) given.%0a> Once approved, the power or item must be developed IC:%0a> From the Request Tool create an Action type request for your Character Type’s Group.%0a> Attach the approved Custom Item/Power Request along with any development suggestions from the Rules Master.%0a> Specify in the request whether your character is hoping to build (i.e., craft) the item or power or retrieve the item or power.%0a> Power/Item types that provide a creation system in the books are created with the systems provided. In addition, a single scene or bluebook must be provided as Justification, involving some aspect of the creation process. Scenes do not need to involve an ST.%0a> Note: System required dice rolls should be attached to the request.%0a> In the case of power or item types that don’t have a concrete system, a number of Justifications must be provided equal to the level of the item/power. These can include scenes (with or without an ST), bluebooks, applicable merit uses (discussed with the Rules Master), and extended rolls (discussed with the Rules Master. Only successful rolls apply, of course). A scene or blue book MUST be one of the chosen Justifications.%0a> Retrieval: In the case of custom items that a character would like to ‘find’ or otherwise physically acquire in-character, the above Justification system is still used, representing the process of researching and seeking it out, but needing to involve a Scene run by an ST for actually acquiring the item (though this may be done via PRP). Retrievals are never Private.%0a> Once Justified, the item/power is sent back to the Rules Master for purchase (assuming you have the Experience), at which point it will be added to the wiki.%0a> Only one custom item/power may be submitted per month per character, no matter how long it takes to create it, and only one may be in ‘development’ at a time.%0a> Customizable Traits%0a> The following is a list, by Faction, of what can be custom-made with the above system. An * means that item can use the ‘retrieval’ system, and ** means they MUST be ‘retrieved’.%0a> %0a> Vampire: Devotions, Carthian Law, Invictus Oath, Scales of the Dragon, and Rituals.%0a> Carthian Law is inherently Public simply due to its often-external nature.%0a> Those with Protean 2/4 may submit Predatory Aspects and Unnatural Aspects without Justification or counting against the monthly limit, for now.%0a> Werewolf: Rites, Pack Tactics, Fetishes/Talens*.%0a> Changeling: Goblin Contracts, Tokens**.%0a> Goblin Contracts always cost 2xp, period, and should be balanced appropriately. This means they require 2 Justifications%0a> Mortal+: Supernatural Merits (Including those for ‘Micro’ templates).%0a> ONLY Mortals may create new supernatural merits; Others with means of learning them can learn those developed by mortals, but cannot create new ones themselves.%0a> Mages use the Creative Thaumaturgy systems listed in their own rules, and their magic items are similarly based off of spells/attainments and use those system; thus, they have no ‘monthly’ limit.%0a> All may submit ‘modifications’ for powers like Protean, Biomimicry, Chrysalis, and similar ‘animal aspect’ type abilities that allow you to gain modular benefits. This does not have a monthly limit, but again, please don’t submit for anything you can’t use.%0a> Note: Mundane Items%0a> Mundane but still custom items are still submitted to the Rules Master for mechanical approval before the actual crafting roll is made, but no ‘Justifications’ are needed beyond what’s needed to get any materials needed for the item. Similarly, they are not limited to one per month. [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> General House Rules%0a> Merits which grant Merits%0a> Mystery Cult Initiation benefits ignore prerequisites and type restrictions, except when a benefit relies on a trait or template ability that the character doesn’t have.%0a> Level 5 can provide a merit that’s essentially ‘rewritten’ for different traits, or that’s universally usable somehow, but other levels can’t.%0a> If a character cannot benefit from a given level, they instead receive an appropriate number of dots of RELATED merits; they must either be close to the benefit granted by that dot level, or thematically related to the cult, and these replacement dots do NOT ignore prerequisites or type restrictions.%0a> When a Totem grants merits, they can ignore prerequisites, but not type restrictions. If a Totem would grant a merit that a pack member cannot benefit from for that reason, this works the same way as if they had the ‘maximum’ rating, and they may take other benefits relevant to the Totem that Totem can normally grant.%0a> Replacement traits do not ignore prerequisites.%0a> Masques never ignore prerequisites.%0a> No Merits that provide access to other merits or similar traits at lower effective cost may ever provide access to OTHER merits that grant merits or other traits at lower cost. For instance, you cannot have a Totem that provides Professional Training, or take a Masque that grants Mystery Cult Influence.%0a> NEW Merit: Neighborhood (1–5)%0a> Prerequisite%0a> Neighborhood must be available or claimed by an agreeing, allied individual or group.%0a> When an individual or group has accrued enough status or the ability to claim and hold a Neighborhood as territory, they can then begin to develop the Neighborhood to work for them. This merit reflects an investment of time and effort to focus the mundane and potentially supernatural aspects of a Neighborhood towards the goals.%0a> Notification if any other individual or group is attempting to make a move on the territory. Perhaps a Neighborhood Watch has been established and strange faces cause a stir, or a general paranoia of being hunted has made the citizens of the Neighborhood overly cautious. Either way snooping or aggressive actions cause rumors.%0a> Select one skill. Everyone in the Neighborhood receives a +1 to dice pools involving that skill. Your actions or the actions of your group, whether positive or negative, have made certain things just a little easier for residents of your Neighborhood. However, others passing through also have access to this benefit.%0a> +1 Defense while in the Neighborhood. This is your turf. You know it and all the tricks and turns and the doors that will open and unlock. You know how to take advantage of the terrain to your benefit.%0a> Antagonists or Opponents receive a &#8722;1 to aggressive or threatening actions. You or your group are deeply entrenched in the Neighborhood. People may or may not know your face on sight, but your presence has instilled a deep territorial bent in everyone who lives in your Neighborhood. Anyone who tries to make a move against the Neighborhood will have some serious problems accomplishing it.%0a> Increase a bonus or a penalty to ± 3. Depending on what you or your group is attempting to accomplish in the neighborhood, you can choose which one of the previous dot benefits to improve.%0a> Increase an enemy’s penalties? The neighborhood starts to get very insular and distrustful of outsiders. They know who belongs and who doesn’t.%0a> Increase defense? The Neighborhood may or may not be more welcoming, but it has been honed as a defensive stronghold for you and your group. The residents will make protecting you a priority, even when other benefits could be had by putting their attention elsewhere.%0a> Increase a skill bonus? The neighborhood becomes well known for what it does best. Perhaps the University which supports a +3 to Academics starts to attract better teachers, smarter students, and more funding. Residential areas with a +3 to Larceny gain a reputation for being a rough place to live and attract gangs, etc.%0a> When requesting Neighborhood, the specify the merit note to be: Neighborhood Name (Group Name if applicable) for example: Neighborhood: Centennial (Leafy Bros). [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Merit: Mystery Cult Initiation%0a> A character may only have a total of 6 dots assigned to different versions of this merit.%0a> %0a> Initiation may be in a setting-created Cults or Groups (See Mystery Cults) or a player may create a new Cult (see below).%0a> Use the Notes section under Character Bio to identify the merit or skill benefits obtained by this merit, and the Sanctioning Staff will add them to your sheet during sanctioning.%0a> Player-Created Cults%0a> To have a custom Mystery Cult approved for play, submit the details (including Purpose, Relic (optional), and Doctrine, as described in the merit, ties to the setting, and basic associations of Initiation level with standing in the Cult) to a StoryMaster, along with the Initiation benefits.%0a> This should be done BEFORE character creation if not being created In Character.%0a> Note that at least 2 PCs need to be involved in a Cult for it to gain the mechanical benefits of Mystery Cult Initiation BEFORE being submitted, with it being open to more members.%0a> All Cults need at least one member with 5 dots of Initiation or Influence. This can be an NPC with Storymaster permission, but must be discussed with them.%0a> If approved, the Cult becomes a facet of the setting just like anything else (it’s not meant for simply adding on to a cabal/pack/other closed group), and may be made to have ties with existing or new NPCs, existing or future plots, other PCs, or the city’s Spheres, as the STM deems appropriate. The player will not always have 100%25 control over this, but their Initiation level will give them sway as appropriate. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Merit: Status (1–5)%0a> Status can be gained in a combination of purchase via the merit or appointment to positions which confer status. For example, a Vampire character may gain the status of Sheriff which confers the status of 4 in the Court.%0a> %0a> Acknowledged Member - Can be purchased with XP.%0a> All characters receive 1 free dot of status in one Faction-specific group at Character Creation.%0a> Trusted Member - Can be purchased with XP.%0a> Respected Member, lower ranks of leadership - Can be obtained via position which confers status at no cost.%0a> Leader - Can be obtained via position which confers status at no cost.%0a> Indispensable Authority - Can be obtained via position which confers status at no cost.%0a> Note%0a> The role definitions listed above are rough guidelines that apply to most groups. Certain groups and/or player created groups (i.e., cults) may define the status dots differently. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Psychokinetic Resistance%0a> Any non-mortal that has a way to learn Psychokinetic Resistance, through whatever means, will never be able to use it as a way to protect against their splat’s inherent ‘ weaknesses, or developed weaknesses like Vampiric Banes or Changeling Frailties. It simply provides no protection. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> General Clarifications%0a> Ephemera Summoning%0a> When using an ability to summon ephemeral entities not represented by a merit on your sheet, staff is needed to summon anything of Rank 2+, or for any hostile (PvP) purposes. Obviously, you must be within the power’s range of a potential entity. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Fighting Styles%0a> Weapon Prerequisites%0a> When a fighting style or other merit/ability prerequisite relies on a weapon of a certain damage rating, use the weapon’s base rating in the case of magically or supernaturally enhanced items. (Example: A 1L knife with +3 damage due to being magical still counts as a 1L knife for the purpose of the Light Weapons fighting style)%0a> Lethal Unarmed Damage%0a> If you have a way to make your unarmed attacks do lethal damage, they do that instead of bashing for fighting styles saying you do a certain amount of bashing damage or improve bashing damage from unarmed attacks, so long as it makes sense for the lethal appendage(s) to be capable of the maneuver. Note that per Hurt Locker, striking styles only work with normal human appendages, however.%0a> Animal Forms%0a> Fighting styles relying on human appendages will not work in animal forms.%0a> PCs may gain the benefits from styles like K9 and Falconry if they can turn into that form and have specifically trained in it that way. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Game Timeframes%0a> One scene is one hour in downtime (but is just a scene as normal in-game), a chapter is a week, a story is a month, a chronicle is 3 months. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Grappling%0a> Damage done via the Damage maneuver, as well as similar ‘success based’ maneuvers, like Feed, deal net successes in damage/blood/etc, not total.%0a> Activating powers can be done normally if reflexive, and if you win the grapple roll for instant actions.%0a> Mages use the rules in their own book for spellcasting in a grapple.%0a> Clarification: When grappled, you do not lose your first turn if you haven’t gone. You may still make a roll to ‘contest’ the initial grapple and try to escape, or do another action that the grapple wouldn’t prevent.%0a> Clarification: Ties in grappling are re-rolled, but the initial roll is what determines level of success.%0a> Clarification: When you get an exceptional success, using Break Free after another move does NOT give you another action unless the other maneuver was also reflexive.%0a> Clarification: You may NOT choose the same maneuver twice with an exceptional success (e.g no damaging twice). \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Hurt Locker%0a> ‘Integrity’ merits%0a> Support Network works for Integrity, Humanity, Clarity, and Wisdom breaking points, but not Harmony.%0a> Scarred may only be taken for Integrity.%0a> Violent Skills%0a> Most of the Violent Skill uses are usable as is, though may need Narrator oversight when the need of an ST is mentioned.%0a> Academics’ system for removing merits works week by week instead of day by day, to reflect the flow of a chat game, and merits like Neighborhood can warn the target of such an attempt, as may others at Staff discretion. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Merits Shared By Multiple Characters%0a> Merits benefits are capped at 5 unless the merit specifies a higher cap. If more than 5+ characters have purchased 1+ dots in a pooled Merit so that the total dots invested is greater than 5, the merit is still considered 5, unless it is a specific exception.%0a> In order to benefit from a pooled merit, a character must have purchased at least 1 dot of that merit - unless the merit says otherwise, or logically would apply anyway. Safe Place, for instance, only gives initiative to those with the merit, but the penalty to breaking in benefits anyone inside. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Merits within Spheres%0a> Characters are encouraged to take Status in the different Spheres. However when purchasing Contacts and Allies it’s inappropriate to list the entire Sphere. Instead Contacts and Allies should be specific subsets within the larger Sphere that the character would have access to.%0a> Status (Business)%0a> Contacts (Secretary Pool)%0a> Allies (Middle Managers)%0a> Poison%0a> Clarification: When in combat, all poisons inflict the Poisoned Tilt. It’s moderate for Toxicity 1–5, and Severe for Toxicity 6–10.%0a> Clarification: Out of combat, if a given source of Toxicity doesn’t say otherwise, the damage dealt happens one time. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Pre-empting Social Actions%0a> Merits that work like Table Turned and let you pre-empt social actions are declared after the original roll is made, and works normally at that point. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Professional Training%0a> The dice tricks provided (9-again, rote) never affect supernatural powers. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Retainers, Familiars, etc.%0a> Derived Traits%0a> Defense is equal to Retainer rating%0a> Speed is equal to Species Factor + (Retainer dots * 2)%0a> Retainers can’t spend Willpower, but if they need it for powers assume they have (Retainer dots) available for a given scene.%0a> Initiative is (Retainer dots * 2)%0a> Hedgebeasts%0a> Merits for NPCs represented on a sheet by a merit (like Hedgebeasts) can only be personal in scope (That is, doesn’t represent external NPCs, items, or locations). For instance, a Hedge Beast Companion can not take a Retainer, Safe Place, or Allies, but can take Encyclopedic Knowledge or a Style merit. Merits/Abilities like Attache (VtR pg 110) that explicitly provide that sort of merit to a Retainer (or whatever else) are unchanged, however. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Animal Stats%0a> Retainer animals use the basic Retainer system, as referenced below%0a> Animal stats not in one of the published books should come from the official add-on here \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Supernatural Retainers%0a> Retainers cannot be full template creatures likes Mages or Vampires, except in explicitly defined, limited cases like the Sanctuary merit.%0a> Retainers representing ephemeral entities, Mortal+ characters, or Half-Templates gain 1 dot of an appropriate Power per 2 dots in the Retainer merit, rounded up.%0a> Ghouls gain Discipline dots, Wolf-Blooded gain Tells, Fae-Touched gain dots of Contracts, Mortal+ characters gain dots of Supernatural merits, and Ephemeral Entities gain Numina.%0a> Ephemeral Entities have a Rank equal to half the Retainer merit (round up), and Influences/Manifestations appropriate to it, but use normal dice pools for the merit. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Sleight of Hand (Merit)%0a> Supernaturally enhanced senses count as ‘trying’ to catch the user inherently, but a roll must still be made as normal.%0a> Remember that penalties still apply; especially difficult actions like swiping someone’s latched-on watch is more difficult than picking a pocket, for instance, and will have a dice penalty as appropriate. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Specialties%0a> You may buy a specialty in a given power type (a specific Discipline, i.e. Auspex, for instance, or a specific Gift, like Elements) for a given skill, and this applies a bonus as normal. Similarly, any other specialty that might apply can affect power uses too.%0a> Remember that up to 3 different specialties may apply to a given skill roll. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Social Maneuvering and PCs%0a> Use the systems described in Chronicles of Darkness, pg 82–83 with regards to using Social Maneuvering on other characters.%0a> Players decide the Impression others have with their character, but this should generally start as Average without other circumstances, and constant claims of Hostile impression for no good reason will be investigated by the staff. Supernatural powers that define or alter Impression somehow always supersede this.%0a> Note: The examples in the books of simple instant rolls like intimidation or persuasion to make someone do what you want with a single success are meant as abstractions for unimportant NPCs, they do NOT force specific actions from PCs. However, simple social rolls still shouldn’t be entirely ignored, they should evoke an emotional response if not resisted, it just does not dictate action. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Soul Loss%0a> Use the systems in Mage: the Awakening and the World of Darkness 2E: The God Machine Rules Update. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Travel to Other Realms%0a> Characters with an ‘affinity’ to another realm, whether through splat (Werewolf/Thyrsus Mage to Shadow, Changeling to the Hedge) or character build/concept (A Gravewright changeling with Underworld specs and the Underworld), may go to the ‘nearby’ areas of the related realm, for instance a Trod in the Hedge or the Autocthnous Depths of the Underworld. The latter requires Storymaster approval that your character has said ‘affinity’.%0a> Going deeper in, or to any area that’s expected to be dangerous even ‘nearby’ requires a staff member present (this can include someone running an approved PrP), as does going in if you lack affinity at all.%0a> As an exception, if a character who DOES have affinity is guiding no more than 1–2 others through the nearby area, and they have appropriate traits to do so (a specialty in navigating the area, for instance), no staff member is needed so long as the above rules are followed. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Touchstones%0a> Touchstones of any sort may not be of the same character type of the character that has it (A Vampire can not have a Vampiric Touchstone, for instance). If a Touchstone changes into that template, it counts as if they died.%0a> PCs may be Touchstones, and work normally, but must be approved by a Storymaster and the other player (the character doesn’t need to know what they are, though), which may delay sanctioning. Werewolves may only take PCs as physical Touchstones.%0a> In the case of a character idle-desanctioning or otherwise desanctioning without dying or otherwise being lost, a new Touchstone should be selected via request, but there’s no mechanical requirement or drawback for doing so.%0a> Mortals and half-templates are just about always suitable as Touchstones, even within the same Faction.%0a> Other Supernaturals MAY be suitable as Touchstones, if they truly remind the character of their human side somehow, but this is generally rare, and again, needs Storymaster permission (along with the other player); in such cases, it should only be another PC. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Changeling House Rules and Clarifications%0a> Goblin Contracts%0a> Goblin Contracts have the following house rules to make them ‘backwards compatible’ until the book is out:%0a> Instead of losing favored Regalia as a Hedge Denizen, you no longer gain free Seeming blessings from Contracts.%0a> Goblin Queen provides dots of Retainers = to Wyrd that can have Contract dots as normal.%0a> For when there’s no staff around to spend Goblin Debt, you should have a condition/tilt associated with each Goblin Contract upon purchase; when you reach 5 debt you always gain that condition/tilt and spend the debt (when the debt’s from multiple contracts, use the last one activated). The exception is if you specifically note you’re trying to gain the Hedge Denizen condition ahead of time, in which case Debt is only spent by staff normally. Note current Debt in the Conditions section of your sheet.%0a> Goblin Contracts always cost 2xp, period, and should be balanced appropriately. This means they currently require 2 Justifications to create with the Custom Item/Power system. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Ensorcellment%0a> The playtest document doesn’t cover how to ensorcel, but does provide mechanics for the ensorcelled. So, until the book is published with those rules, a given changeling may ‘upkeep’ 1 ensorcelled mortal (or supernatural), the ensorcellment of which is assumed to happen in downtime for the time being.%0a> Please avoid calling it a pledge or similar because we don’t know for certain if that’s how it works. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Exotic Airs (• to •••••)%0a> The following rules are a temporary replacement for the missing ‘Exotic Airs’ merit in the Playtest%0a> Effect: Your character can harvest the emotions of some of the stranger creatures of the World of Darkness. Each dot of this Merit allows your character to gain Glamour from one type of supernatural creature. This may mean werewolves, ghosts, mummies, zombies, or stranger things still. The Glamour works the same way as if it had been harvested from a mortal. This DOES allow such characters to be Reaped, as well, but they may inherently make a roll to determine the source, and add their Supernatural Tolerance to it. %0a> Drawback: This advantage does not inherently mean the character is (more) able to interact with the chosen subject. For example, ghosts exist in an ethereal state, and their emotions tend to be dead and blunted. If you take this Merit, work with your Storyteller to determine how your character might harvest from these monsters.%0a> \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Clarification: Changeling Hours%0a> When used on living things, Rewind the Clock doesn’t generally do much (unless counteracting similar age-based damaging powers), and Speed the Clock does bashing damage.%0a> The fairest benefit affects all living supernaturals normally. Vampires (and other immortal/undead beings) are unaffected by Rewind or Speed the clock, but can be affected by Freeze the Clock. A Resolve + Wyrd contested roll is added in for freeze the clock. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Playtest Documents%0a> Changeling 2ed is still in development and as part of the open playtest process, large sections of rules have been made available to the community. Chapters 1 and 3 are more recent releases and superseded rules published in the V.6 compilation.%0a> %0a> Playtest Compilation V.6%0a> Playtest Chapter 1: Seemings and Kiths%0a> Playtest Chapter 3: The Laws We Live By%0a> Clarification: Cloak of Elements, Control Elements, etc%0a> Elemental contracts require an element be chosen with the purchase. An elemental affinity that lets you manifest or control two elements gives you the second for free, and that affinity is a cheap way to buy a second element for others, too.%0a> For Phantom Glory’s Elemental affinity, it can be purchased multiple times for new elements (only the first is free for Elementals). \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Mage House Rules and Clarifications%0a> Beneficial Conditions and Spellcasting%0a> Beneficial Conditions (such as Informed, Inspiring, and Steadfast) granted directly by spells NEVER grant beats when resolved, even if cast with an exceptional success.%0a> Creative Thaumaturgy%0a> A large part of Mage’s thematics hinge on the flexibility of magic, but that sort of flexibility is difficult on a chat game compared to tabletop. However, we don’t want to entirely prevent ‘on the fly’ magic or Creative Thaumaturgy, so we’re implementing the following rules:%0a> %0a> Creative Thaumaturgy may be performed in staff-run scenes ‘on the fly’, at the staff member’s discretion. Being allowed to perform a spell in a staff-run scene without it being finalized (see below), however, does NOT guarantee that it can be used again, as the mechanics will generally be simplified and made to suit the current situation.%0a> Creative Thaumaturgy spells may be submitted to the “Rules Master” group via a “Custom Item/Power” request, where it will be discussed and balanced as needed. There’s no specific time limit between submissions, but please only submit CT for spells you’re capable of casting and actively plan to use.%0a> Once approved, Creative Thaumaturgy spells will be made publicly available on the wiki, and can be cast and used by anyone as if they came from an official source.%0a> If no staff is present, you may only perform approved and published spells in scenes.%0a> Note that for now, only spells can be submitted, not custom Reach effects for published spells, to avoid difficulties cross-referencing.%0a> Exceptional Successes on Casting%0a> The listed option of ignoring all Withstand ratings on an exceptional success in spellcasting is not available.%0a> Pattern Restoration%0a> Pattern Restoration is not able to remove Conditions or Tilts that are supernatural in nature; they need to be removed with appropriate spells (or resolved normally). It can remove mundane conditions/tilts that are applied because of supernatural powers, however (but if the power’s still active, this may be a Clash of Wills or it may just be re-applied).%0a> %0a> Sleepwalkers%0a> TO clarify, Sleepwalkers are not mechanically considered a “half-template” for the Mage venue regardless of how involved in the Mage venue the Sleepwalker may be. Instead, Sleepwalker is a classification for characters who are immune to the Curse, cause no Dissonance, do not increase Paradox and remember what they’ve seen (as pertains to the Supernal). Additionally, characters who fall under this classification can purchase Sleepwalker Merits.%0a> Character types who are considered Sleepwalkers (Note: Only 1 of the following is necessary):%0a> %0a> Mortals who have purchased the Sleepwalker merit%0a> Mortals who have purchased an “internal” Supernatural merit (Chronicles of Darkness)%0a> Changelings, Vampires, Werewolves, Fae-touched, Ghouls, Wolf-blooded or any other supernatural template.%0a> Ephemeral beings and similar ‘Non-Template’ entities, like Strix and Oneroi, do not count as Sleepwalkers for the purpose of related mechanics, but nor do they count as Sleepers for the sake of paradox.%0a> Unsafe Relinquishment%0a> Relinquishing a spell unsafely (with a willpower point) is an act of hubris at the Understanding level without an immediate need to. An inured spell is of course not affected by this.%0a> Clarification: Boons%0a> Fate spells that grant a boon cannot provide a Potency dice bonus to casting dice pools, even if the spell lists affecting spellcasting pools as its own Reach option. Dice Tricks (e.g 9-again) affect spellcasting normally if Reach is used.%0a> Clarification: Combined Spells%0a> Combined spells have the same factors (if their Primary differs, choose one), including specified targets/area, unless a Reach is spent to separate the Scale.%0a> Clarification: Nimbus Tilt%0a> Nimbus Tilts only affect those actively witnessing them, meaning those using Mage Sight (or other supernatural powers that can perceive it), or anyone when the Nimbus is deliberately flared; this also includes the offender when the Nimbus is used defensively. However, the mage flaring the Nimbus is not affected by their own Tilt in any case.%0a> Clarification: Resistance and Withstanding%0a> Merits and abilities that subtract from a type of power’s resisted dice pool instead raises Withstand by 1/2 the amount (round up) when dealing with spells.%0a> Merits and abilities that specifically treat the trait as higher just do exactly that.%0a> Clarification: Shielding Spells%0a> As listed in the Creative Thaumaturgy rules, Shielding spells will only protect against a number of supernatural effects equal to the spell’s potency for a given casting.%0a> Policy: Staff and Paradox%0a> Releasing Paradox always requires a staff member present to direct the paradox Reach; it’s recommended not to release paradox for downtime casting%0a> Internal Paradoxes require a staff member to be notified if more than 5 successes are rolled beyond what’s absorbed by Wisdom, as a new Paradox condition is likely to be needed.%0a> \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Mortal House Rules and Clarifications%0a> New Merits%0a> Unseen Sense, Advanced (•••)%0a> Prerequisite%0a> Unseen Sense%0a> Effect%0a> Your characters sixth sense for a type of supernatural creature is increased. By spending a point of Willpower she can extend the range of her unseen senses to 100 yards. As with Unseen Sense, the player can accept the Spooked Condition, in exchange for which the character can pinpoint where the feeling is coming from; this reveals all triggers of it within that range. If the target is using a power that specifically cloaks its supernatural nature, however, this does not work (though the Condition remains until resolved as usual), nor does it work against powers that use mental illusions to conceal or otherwise hide the character.%0a> Unseen Sense, Epic (•••)%0a> Prerequisite%0a> Unseen Sense%0a> Effect%0a> Your characters sixth sense is increased to detect any supernatural creature, and she is able to distinguish between them. As with Unseen Sense, Advanced, the player can accept the Spooked Condition, in exchange for which the character can pinpoint where the feeling is coming from; this reveals all triggers of it within that range. If the target is using a power that specifically cloaks its supernatural nature, however, this does not work (though the Condition remains until resolved as usual), nor does it work against powers that use mental illusions to conceal or otherwise hide the character.%0a> Psychic Vampires%0a> Hunting%0a> For keeping track of Ephemera, use the Vampire rules for Hunting, listed here and in the Vampire Core where referenced, replacing Vitae with Ephemera, and gaining Empowered (Psychic Vampirism) instead of Sated on an exceptional.\\ If you lack the Vampire book, the hunting rules essentially involve putting together a dice pool for how you hunt, and then taking penalties (&#8722;2 each) for additional vessels being hunted with that roll. Ask the Rules Master for any clarifications needed on different traits. [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Vampire House Rules and Clarifications%0a> Vitae and Hunting%0a> The feeding and hunting systems, provided in Vampire: the Requiem 2nd Edition, are largely unchanged. However, there are a few house rules in place to make it easier to manage in a chat environment, both for players and Storymasters:%0a> %0a> It’s assumed all Kindred hunt for an average of 1 Vitae per night in their downtime, to counteract the loss of Vitae from waking from daysleep, so Vitae pools don’t decrease over time by default. Players otherwise keep track of their own Vitae pools from night to night.%0a> Note: If under the effect of any power or circumstance that would prevent you from ‘casually’ feeding with normal mechanics, you do NOT get the nightly Vitae back in downtime; any feeding methodologies will need to account for the nightly loss.%0a> A Vampire PC’s player may make one hunting roll per chapter (Week), using the system for ‘feeding scenes with dice’ on VtR2e page 96. Dramatic failure cannot be willingly taken, and an Exceptional success instead provides the Sated condition. If a Dramatic Failure is somehow naturally rolled, contact a Narrator.%0a> The vitae gained from the weekly roll can be applied throughout the week rather than all at once. For example, if you are down 2 vitae and a hunt gains 6 vitae, 2 vitae can be applied immediately and 4 remaining can be used to replenish any other losses for that week.%0a> 1 vessel = 3 vitae (or 7 with a breaking point).%0a> Vitae gained In-Character from other PCs or ST-NPCs works normally and has no effect on hunting rolls or visa versa. You may not, however, gain Vitae from retainers or similar merits in this way; if they’re willing to provide blood to you, buy Herd.%0a> If there’s any confusion about something might be affected by this, ask a Narrator (if in a scene) or the Rules Master. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Blood Bonding%0a> Blood bonds may only be raised by 1 step per night via traditional feeding methods (powers that apply the blood bond are not limited in this way, however).%0a> Players are expected to give OOC notice if the scene or action has the intent to be to bond a character. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Clarification: Auspex%0a> The sample questions for the first three levels are not your only options. You may ask anything relevant as described by that discipline.%0a> Lay Open the Mind and dreams: This works normally on someone sleeping (thus allowing dream-watching), but projected thoughts/images can’t override actual Dreamwalking, nor does it provide any such abilities beyond what’s listed in the Discipline. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Clarification: Animalism%0a> While Feral Whispers allows communication with other supernatural creatures in animal forms, it can’t be used to command them. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Clarification: Swarm Form%0a> Use the statistics in the Chronicles of Darkness 2e book, pg 121, for ‘Trained Guard Dog’ to determine your swarm’s base physical traits. The ‘Bite’ dice pool gives you your ‘Strength + Brawl’, and you can extrapolate a Brawl of 2 and Athletics of 3 if you need any other physical skills (the rest are 0). \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Clarification: Downgrading Damage%0a> The book isn’t entirely all-inclusive on what gets downgraded from aggravated to lethal or lethal to bashing. So, unless a power/ability (on either side) explicitly says otherwise, or a Narrator deems differently due to unique circumstances in a scene, the following rules apply:%0a> %0a> Fire/Sunlight damage is of course not downgraded, from any source.%0a> Any mundane source of aggravated or lethal damage is downgraded (including Fighting/Style merits, and Environmental Tilts).%0a> Direct supernatural sources that deal lethal damage (such as Nightmare 5 or the Mind Flay Mage spell) are not downgraded unless it works through mundane vectors like organ failure.%0a> Supernatural powers creating weapons, environmental tilts, or redirecting external forces (such as Telekinesis) are downgraded normally.%0a> Supernatural sources of aggravated damage are usually downgraded.%0a> Exception: Vampiric powers that say they deal aggravated damage deal aggravated damage even to Vampires, because they’re the basis within Vampire books.%0a> Supernatural powers that say Vampires may be immune, downgrade the damage, or otherwise suffer less harm at Storyteller discretion (like Mage’s Rend Lifespan) have that lesser effect on Vampires by default. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Clarification: Tech-Savvy%0a> Tech-Savvy is for mundane, physical (or electronic) equipment. It cannot be used for ‘Mystical’/’Occult’ equipment, plans, repositories, creative works, etc. It CAN be used, of course, for labs and other tools that’d grant benefits to crafting those things, but will not benefit the end product directly. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Grafting Unholy Flesh%0a> By default, a Graft created with Grafting Unholy Flesh will last only a number of uses equal to the Scale user’s dots in Zirnitra (minimum of 1). In the case of normally ‘permanent’ abilities, they’re reflexively activated for a scene as one ‘use’. After these uses, the part rots away.%0a> To keep a Graft permanently, you must buy the Graft (• - •••••) merit, which is not available at Creation. The cost is equal to 1xp per dot level of the power being grafted; in the case of powers with no ratings, this will default to 3 and be adjusted up or down by the staff on a case by case basis (which will be recorded as they’re decided on)%0a> Grafting Unholy Flesh doesn’t work on ‘innate’ abilities like a Werewolf’s shapeshifting or a Mage’s Sight.%0a> As well, certain NPC-type powers, such as certain Dread Powers, rare Numina, and similar may not be graftable at StoryMaster and Rules Master discretion. This is in addition to the existing restrictions against taking template abilities.%0a> Traits unique to the ‘donor’ template type use the donor’s rating for all dice pools and derived effects. Attributes, skills, and other trait types the Vampire DOES have access to use their own ratings (other than the grafted power rating itself, of course).%0a> If using this Scale to gain a Mage’s power, you choose from their Praxes or Rotes, not Arcana, though individual Attainments can be taken one for one as normal. Similarly, it can’t be used to gain Blood Sorcery dots, but can be used for individual Rituals.%0a> You must always submit an Action request when using this Scale, and keep track of the Health levels of any relevant parts. Any mechanical issues will be decided on a power by power basis. \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> %0a> Werewolf House Rules and Clarifications%0a> Packs%0a> Pack Experiences are not in use%0a> Packs may be formed either pre-creation or IC, but only involves PCs or those directly represented with merits; no ‘Secondary’ characters are created. Totems are created normally.%0a> Packs do gain the normal 5 dots of Pack merits, but other dots must be purchased by individual characters contributing their personal Experiences.%0a> Hunting Natures are not in use, due to the difficulty of keeping track. No drawbacks or benefits of the conditions are gained.%0a> Packs may purchase and use Pack Tactics of any level as well as use them spontaneously, though the latter may only occur in a scene with a Storyteller, who will approve their use on the spot; this does not guarantee every staff member will allow the same one in the future.%0a> Tactics must be purchased via individual pack members contributing Experiences%0a> Developing learned Pack Tactics for purchase follows the same guidelines as other Custom Creations.%0a> To clarify, the Primal Instincts Tell is required for Wolf-Blooded to participate in Pack Tactics. Non-Werewolves otherwise cannot do so.%0a> Wolf-Blooded Changing to Another Faction/Template%0a> Former Wolf-Blooded characters retain ONE tell when changing into anything besides a Werewolf. Any additional Tells purchased are lost with all other Wolf-Blooded merits.%0a> %0a> Thrice Born Merit & Clarification%0a> Definition%0a> A Thrice-Born is a wolf-blood with two very specific tells: Second Skin and Shadow Twin. The other component to being Thrice-Born is the culture in which their gifts are cultivated. Simply having the right combination of Tells is not enough. Thrice-Born are raised with duty and service to the Uratha and their culture. Thrice-born believe that they are a special part of Uratha culture, where the Wolf, the Man and the Spirit are born in separate, distinct forms. Because they have this unique perspective of what it is to be a servant of Luna, then they are duty bound to serve and fight.%0a> %0a> There are specific drawbacks and benefits to being a Thrice-Born. Thrice-Born are raised in a militaristic manner, a very hierarchical familial group who expects them to serve the Uratha as warriors, and scouts, and keeps their arcane education at the forefront of that. After all, sending the ignorant into battle is a surefire way to make sure they die first.%0a> %0a> They are expected to serve All Uratha as their assistance is called upon, and they are not allowed to pick and choose their battles. As they are servants to all, they will not get involved in conflicts between packs. They do not claim territory. They do not join packs, except with other Thrice-born or packs exclusive to their familial group, who understand the duty they must do.%0a> %0a> Thrice-Born Can and Do undergo the first change. Unlike other Wolfbloods, when the Thrice-born first changes into an Uratha, they will lose both Shadow Twin and Second Skin tells. They are no longer Thrice-Born, as those separate aspects have joined into one, complete being. As such, the other Thrice-Born will still pay them honor as having shared in their struggles and run as a servant, but will no longer count them among their numbers.%0a> %0a> NEW Wolfblooded ONLY Merit: THRICE BORN (**)%0a> Wolfblood Only Merit - to be listed publicly on wiki and sheets %0a> Prerequisites: Shadow Twin (Tell), Second Skin (Tell) %0a> Optional: Family Status-Hayes%0a> %0a> Benefits%0a> The Thrice Born Merit identifies a Blooded as a Thrice-Born. There are benefits to this%0a> %0a> .	+2 in assist/teamwork rolls with Werewolves and their allies.%0a> .	+1 to persuasion rolls among the Uratha of Portland.%0a> .	&#8722;2 to those in the Werewolf faction initiating hostile actions upon the wolfblood. Follow up hostile actions have no penalty.%0a> Drawbacks%0a> There are drawbacks as well:%0a> %0a> .	They can only join packs with other Thrice-Born or PC’s with Family Status-Hayes%0a> .	They cannot take the Neighborhood Merit, even as pack members.%0a> .	They cannot hold Territories, as they are servants to all Uratha.%0a> .	If the Wolfblood undergoes the First Change, they will lose both the Second Skin and Shadow Twin merits, as well as the Thrice-Born merit, as they are no longer considered Thrice-Born.%0a> The First Change-Mechanics%0a> When a Thrice Born undergoes the First Change, they are no longer considered Thrice-Born. Unlike other blooded changes, they lose both Second Skin and Spirit Twin tells. XP spent for those merits will be refunded back.They will retain a permanent dot of status in the Hayes family, or gain a second to reflect their service as a Thrice-Born. (Note: only if the change happens IC. This does not apply to Uratha who started the game as changed Thrice-Born. This applies to characters created after this merit was implemented, and will not be applied to current characters who have thrice-born in their background, OR to characters who started the game thrice-born and underwent the first change. It is meant for those who purchased the merit “thrice born” only.)%0a> \\%0a> [[#top | &#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> Status: Hayes Family%0a

Mages always reflexively defend with their Nimbus as described in Mage: the Awakening.%0a%3c All auras can be used to try and defend against supernatural powers that mention any other aura type as able to end it (for instance, Awe).

In these cases, the following defines ‘magic’:%0a%3c %0a%3c Most merits that provide protection against or affect ‘Magic’ in general, without referencing a specific type, protect against any power that’s activated with an extended action, a power that takes longer than a turn to activate by default (even if it can be made to work quicker), and anything that explicitly is called a ‘spell’ or ‘ritual’ in its description.%0a%3c This includes all Supernal magic, all Blood Sorcery, and Rites, among other specific examples.%0a%3c Exception: Mage Spells that target ‘magic’ only affect Awakened magic by default unless it says otherwise.%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c The Mask and ‘Mystical Senses’%0a%3c Kindred Senses only see past the Mask if related to what they normally reveal (life, blood), and ONLY reveal that aspect of the Mien. Auspex 1 (Beast’s Hackles) can reveal the Mien with a question like “What here is hidden behind illusion?”, or if another question would point out the Changeling. Auspex 2 (Uncanny Perception) reveals the Mien if “Is this person a supernatural creature?” is asked, or anything relating to illusion.%0a%3c Wolf Senses allow the Mien to be smelled, but don’t reveal visual information.%0a%3c Mages see past the Mask with Mage Sight, as well as with spells that reveal illusion or visual “truth”.%0a%3c Supernaturals can see past a strengthened mask with a Clash of Wills and the above methods.%0a%3c Vampires and Supernatural blood%0a%3c Unnatural Affinity allows you to feed on the chosen type as if they had vampiric blood.

Private means only the character that created it can use it, or those they’ve directly taught. Public means anyone may learn it (due to it being freely taught or the methodology spread around). Both will be listed on the wiki, for ease of access, but will have their ‘privacy’ noted.%0a%3c The Rules Master will then either approve it, work with the player to balance it out, or deny it if it simply can’t be done with the level or power(s) given.%0a%3c Once approved, the power or item must be developed IC:%0a%3c From the Request Tool create an Action type request for your Character Type’s Group.%0a%3c Attach the approved Custom Item/Power Request along with any development suggestions from the Rules Master.%0a%3c Specify in the request whether your character is hoping to build (i.e., craft) the item or power or retrieve the item or power.%0a%3c Power/Item types that provide a creation system in the books are created with the systems provided. In addition, a single scene or bluebook must be provided as Justification, involving some aspect of the creation process. Scenes do not need to involve an ST.%0a%3c Note: System required dice rolls should be attached to the request.%0a%3c In the case of power or item types that don’t have a concrete system, a number of Justifications must be provided equal to the level of the item/power. These can include scenes (with or without an ST), bluebooks, applicable merit uses (discussed with the Rules Master), and extended rolls (discussed with the Rules Master. Only successful rolls apply, of course). A scene or blue book MUST be one of the chosen Justifications.%0a%3c Retrieval: In the case of custom items that a character would like to ‘find’ or otherwise physically acquire in-character, the above Justification system is still used, representing the process of researching and seeking it out, but needing to involve a Scene run by an ST for actually acquiring the item (though this may be done via PRP). Retrievals are never Private.%0a%3c Once Justified, the item/power is sent back to the Rules Master for purchase (assuming you have the Experience), at which point it will be added to the wiki.%0a%3c Only one custom item/power may be submitted per month per character, no matter how long it takes to create it, and only one may be in ‘development’ at a time.%0a%3c Customizable Traits%0a%3c The following is a list, by Faction, of what can be custom-made with the above system. An * means that item can use the ‘retrieval’ system, and ** means they MUST be ‘retrieved’.%0a%3c %0a%3c Vampire: Devotions, Carthian Law, Invictus Oath, Scales of the Dragon, and Rituals.%0a%3c Carthian Law is inherently Public simply due to its often-external nature.%0a%3c Those with Protean 2/4 may submit Predatory Aspects and Unnatural Aspects without Justification or counting against the monthly limit, for now.%0a%3c Werewolf: Rites, Pack Tactics, Fetishes/Talens*.%0a%3c Changeling: Goblin Contracts, Tokens**.%0a%3c Goblin Contracts always cost 2xp, period, and should be balanced appropriately. This means they require 2 Justifications%0a%3c Mortal+: Supernatural Merits (Including those for ‘Micro’ templates).%0a%3c ONLY Mortals may create new supernatural merits; Others with means of learning them can learn those developed by mortals, but cannot create new ones themselves.%0a%3c Mages use the Creative Thaumaturgy systems listed in their own rules, and their magic items are similarly based off of spells/attainments and use those system; thus, they have no ‘monthly’ limit.%0a%3c All may submit ‘modifications’ for powers like Protean, Biomimicry, Chrysalis, and similar ‘animal aspect’ type abilities that allow you to gain modular benefits. This does not have a monthly limit, but again, please don’t submit for anything you can’t use.%0a%3c Note: Mundane Items%0a%3c Mundane but still custom items are still submitted to the Rules Master for mechanical approval before the actual crafting roll is made, but no ‘Justifications’ are needed beyond what’s needed to get any materials needed for the item.

If a Totem would grant a merit that a pack member cannot benefit from for that reason, this works the same way as if they had the ‘maximum’ rating, and they may take other benefits relevant to the Totem that Totem can normally grant.%0a%3c Replacement traits do not ignore prerequisites.%0a%3c Masques never ignore prerequisites.%0a%3c No Merits that provide access to other merits or similar traits at lower effective cost may ever provide access to OTHER merits that grant merits or other traits at lower cost. For instance, you cannot have a Totem that provides Professional Training, or take a Masque that grants Mystery Cult Influence.%0a%3c NEW Merit: Neighborhood (1–5)%0a%3c Prerequisite%0a%3c Neighborhood must be available or claimed by an agreeing, allied individual or group.%0a%3c When an individual or group has accrued enough status or the ability to claim and hold a Neighborhood as territory, they can then begin to develop the Neighborhood to work for them. This merit reflects an investment of time and effort to focus the mundane and potentially supernatural aspects of a Neighborhood towards the goals.%0a%3c Notification if any other individual or group is attempting to make a move on the territory. Perhaps a Neighborhood Watch has been established and strange faces cause a stir, or a general paranoia of being hunted has made the citizens of the Neighborhood overly cautious. Either way snooping or aggressive actions cause rumors.%0a%3c Select one skill. Everyone in the Neighborhood receives a +1 to dice pools involving that skill. Your actions or the actions of your group, whether positive or negative, have made certain things just a little easier for residents of your Neighborhood. However, others passing through also have access to this benefit.%0a%3c +1 Defense while in the Neighborhood. This is your turf. You know it and all the tricks and turns and the doors that will open and unlock. You know how to take advantage of the terrain to your benefit.%0a%3c Antagonists or Opponents receive a &#8722;1 to aggressive or threatening actions. You or your group are deeply entrenched in the Neighborhood. People may or may not know your face on sight, but your presence has instilled a deep territorial bent in everyone who lives in your Neighborhood. Anyone who tries to make a move against the Neighborhood will have some serious problems accomplishing it.%0a%3c Increase a bonus or a penalty to ± 3. Depending on what you or your group is attempting to accomplish in the neighborhood, you can choose which one of the previous dot benefits to improve.%0a%3c Increase an enemy’s penalties? The neighborhood starts to get very insular and distrustful of outsiders. They know who belongs and who doesn’t.%0a%3c Increase defense? The Neighborhood may or may not be more welcoming, but it has been honed as a defensive stronghold for you and your group. The residents will make protecting you a priority, even when other benefits could be had by putting their attention elsewhere.%0a%3c Increase a skill bonus? The neighborhood becomes well known for what it does best. Perhaps the University which supports a +3 to Academics starts to attract better teachers, smarter students, and more funding. Residential areas with a +3 to Larceny gain a reputation for being a rough place to live and attract gangs, etc.%0a%3c When requesting Neighborhood, the specify the merit note to be: Neighborhood Name (Group Name if applicable) for example: Neighborhood: Centennial (Leafy Bros).

This can be an NPC with Storymaster permission, but must be discussed with them.%0a%3c If approved, the Cult becomes a facet of the setting just like anything else (it’s not meant for simply adding on to a cabal/pack/other closed group), and may be made to have ties with existing or new NPCs, existing or future plots, other PCs, or the city’s Spheres, as the STM deems appropriate.

(Example: A 1L knife with +3 damage due to being magical still counts as a 1L knife for the purpose of the Light Weapons fighting style)%0a%3c Lethal Unarmed Damage%0a%3c If you have a way to make your unarmed attacks do lethal damage, they do that instead of bashing for fighting styles saying you do a certain amount of bashing damage or improve bashing damage from unarmed attacks, so long as it makes sense for the lethal appendage(s) to be capable of the maneuver. Note that per Hurt Locker, striking styles only work with normal human appendages, however.%0a%3c Animal Forms%0a%3c Fighting styles relying on human appendages will not work in animal forms.%0a%3c PCs may gain the benefits from styles like K9 and Falconry if they can turn into that form and have specifically trained in it that way.%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Game Timeframes%0a%3c One scene is one hour in downtime (but is just a scene as normal in-game), a chapter is a week, a story is a month, a chronicle is 3 months.%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Grappling%0a%3c Damage done via the Damage maneuver, as well as similar ‘success based’ maneuvers, like Feed, deal net successes in damage/blood/etc, not total.%0a%3c Activating powers can be done normally if reflexive, and if you win the grapple roll for instant actions.%0a%3c Mages use the rules in their own book for spellcasting in a grapple.%0a%3c Clarification: When grappled, you do not lose your first turn if you haven’t gone. You may still make a roll to ‘contest’ the initial grapple and try to escape, or do another action that the grapple wouldn’t prevent.%0a%3c Clarification: Ties in grappling are re-rolled, but the initial roll is what determines level of success.%0a%3c Clarification: When you get an exceptional success, using Break Free after another move does NOT give you another action unless the other maneuver was also reflexive.%0a%3c Clarification: You may NOT choose the same maneuver twice with an exceptional success (e.g no damaging twice).%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Hurt Locker%0a%3c ‘Integrity’ merits%0a%3c Support Network works for Integrity, Humanity, Clarity, and Wisdom breaking points, but not Harmony.%0a%3c Scarred may only be taken for Integrity.%0a%3c Violent Skills%0a%3c Most of the Violent Skill uses are usable as is, though may need Narrator oversight when the need of an ST is mentioned.%0a%3c Academics’ system for removing merits works week by week instead of day by day, to reflect the flow of a chat game, and merits like Neighborhood can warn the target of such an attempt, as may others at Staff discretion.%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Merits Shared By Multiple Characters%0a%3c Merits benefits are capped at 5 unless the merit specifies a higher cap. If more than 5+ characters have purchased 1+ dots in a pooled Merit so that the total dots invested is greater than 5, the merit is still considered 5, unless it is a specific exception.%0a%3c In order to benefit from a pooled merit, a character must have purchased at least 1 dot of that merit - unless the merit says otherwise, or logically would apply anyway. Safe Place, for instance, only gives initiative to those with the merit, but the penalty to breaking in benefits anyone inside.%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Merits within Spheres%0a%3c Characters are encouraged to take Status in the different Spheres.

For instance, a Hedge Beast Companion can not take a Retainer, Safe Place, or Allies, but can take Encyclopedic Knowledge or a Style merit. Merits/Abilities like Attache (VtR pg 110) that explicitly provide that sort of merit to a Retainer (or whatever else) are unchanged, however.

Supernatural powers that define or alter Impression somehow always supersede this.%0a%3c Note: The examples in the books of simple instant rolls like intimidation or persuasion to make someone do what you want with a single success are meant as abstractions for unimportant NPCs, they do NOT force specific actions from PCs.

The latter requires Storymaster approval that your character has said ‘affinity’.%0a%3c Going deeper in, or to any area that’s expected to be dangerous even ‘nearby’ requires a staff member present (this can include someone running an approved PrP), as does going in if you lack affinity at all.%0a%3c As an exception, if a character who DOES have affinity is guiding no more than 1–2 others through the nearby area, and they have appropriate traits to do so (a specialty in navigating the area, for instance), no staff member is needed so long as the above rules are followed.%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Touchstones%0a%3c Touchstones of any sort may not be of the same character type of the character that has it (A Vampire can not have a Vampiric Touchstone, for instance). If a Touchstone changes into that template, it counts as if they died.%0a%3c PCs may be Touchstones, and work normally, but must be approved by a Storymaster and the other player (the character doesn’t need to know what they are, though), which may delay sanctioning. Werewolves may only take PCs as physical Touchstones.%0a%3c In the case of a character idle-desanctioning or otherwise desanctioning without dying or otherwise being lost, a new Touchstone should be selected via request, but there’s no mechanical requirement or drawback for doing so.%0a%3c Mortals and half-templates are just about always suitable as Touchstones, even within the same Faction.%0a%3c Other Supernaturals MAY be suitable as Touchstones, if they truly remind the character of their human side somehow, but this is generally rare, and again, needs Storymaster permission (along with the other player); in such cases, it should only be another PC.%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Changeling House Rules and Clarifications%0a%3c Goblin Contracts%0a%3c Goblin Contracts have the following house rules to make them ‘backwards compatible’ until the book is out:%0a%3c Instead of losing favored Regalia as a Hedge Denizen, you no longer gain free Seeming blessings from Contracts.%0a%3c Goblin Queen provides dots of Retainers = to Wyrd that can have Contract dots as normal.%0a%3c For when there’s no staff around to spend Goblin Debt, you should have a condition/tilt associated with each Goblin Contract upon purchase; when you reach 5 debt you always gain that condition/tilt and spend the debt (when the debt’s from multiple contracts, use the last one activated). The exception is if you specifically note you’re trying to gain the Hedge Denizen condition ahead of time, in which case Debt is only spent by staff normally. Note current Debt in the Conditions section of your sheet.%0a%3c Goblin Contracts always cost 2xp, period, and should be balanced appropriately.

Each dot of this Merit allows your character to gain Glamour from one type of supernatural creature. This may mean werewolves, ghosts, mummies, zombies, or stranger things still. The Glamour works the same way as if it had been harvested from a mortal. This DOES allow such characters to be Reaped, as well, but they may inherently make a roll to determine the source, and add their Supernatural Tolerance to it. %0a%3c Drawback: This advantage does not inherently mean the character is (more) able to interact with the chosen subject. For example, ghosts exist in an ethereal state, and their emotions tend to be dead and blunted. If you take this Merit, work with your Storyteller to determine how your character might harvest from these monsters.

Chapters 1 and 3 are more recent releases and superseded rules published in the V.6 compilation.%0a%3c %0a%3c Playtest Compilation V.6%0a%3c Playtest Chapter 1: Seemings and Kiths%0a%3c Playtest Chapter 3: The Laws We Live By%0a%3c Clarification: Cloak of Elements, Control Elements, etc%0a%3c Elemental contracts require an element be chosen with the purchase. An elemental affinity that lets you manifest or control two elements gives you the second for free, and that affinity is a cheap way to buy a second element for others, too.%0a%3c For Phantom Glory’s Elemental affinity, it can be purchased multiple times for new elements (only the first is free for Elementals).%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Mage House Rules and Clarifications%0a%3c Beneficial Conditions and Spellcasting%0a%3c Beneficial Conditions (such as Informed, Inspiring, and Steadfast) granted directly by spells NEVER grant beats when resolved, even if cast with an exceptional success.%0a%3c Creative Thaumaturgy%0a%3c A large part of Mage’s thematics hinge on the flexibility of magic, but that sort of flexibility is difficult on a chat game compared to tabletop. However, we don’t want to entirely prevent ‘on the fly’ magic or Creative Thaumaturgy, so we’re implementing the following rules:%0a%3c %0a%3c Creative Thaumaturgy may be performed in staff-run scenes ‘on the fly’, at the staff member’s discretion. Being allowed to perform a spell in a staff-run scene without it being finalized (see below), however, does NOT guarantee that it can be used again, as the mechanics will generally be simplified and made to suit the current situation.%0a%3c Creative Thaumaturgy spells may be submitted to the “Rules Master” group via a “Custom Item/Power” request, where it will be discussed and balanced as needed. There’s no specific time limit between submissions, but please only submit CT for spells you’re capable of casting and actively plan to use.%0a%3c Once approved, Creative Thaumaturgy spells will be made publicly available on the wiki, and can be cast and used by anyone as if they came from an official source.%0a%3c If no staff is present, you may only perform approved and published spells in scenes.%0a%3c Note that for now, only spells can be submitted, not custom Reach effects for published spells, to avoid difficulties cross-referencing.%0a%3c Exceptional Successes on Casting%0a%3c The listed option of ignoring all Withstand ratings on an exceptional success in spellcasting is not available.%0a%3c Pattern Restoration%0a%3c Pattern Restoration is not able to remove Conditions or Tilts that are supernatural in nature; they need to be removed with appropriate spells (or resolved normally). It can remove mundane conditions/tilts that are applied because of supernatural powers, however (but if the power’s still active, this may be a Clash of Wills or it may just be re-applied).%0a%3c %0a%3c Sleepwalkers%0a%3c TO clarify, Sleepwalkers are not mechanically considered a “half-template” for the Mage venue regardless of how involved in the Mage venue the Sleepwalker may be. Instead, Sleepwalker is a classification for characters who are immune to the Curse, cause no Dissonance, do not increase Paradox and remember what they’ve seen (as pertains to the Supernal). Additionally, characters who fall under this classification can purchase Sleepwalker Merits.%0a%3c Character types who are considered Sleepwalkers (Note: Only 1 of the following is necessary):%0a%3c %0a%3c Mortals who have purchased the Sleepwalker merit%0a%3c Mortals who have purchased an “internal” Supernatural merit (Chronicles of Darkness)%0a%3c Changelings, Vampires, Werewolves, Fae-touched, Ghouls, Wolf-blooded or any other supernatural template.%0a%3c Ephemeral beings and similar ‘Non-Template’ entities, like Strix and Oneroi, do not count as Sleepwalkers for the purpose of related mechanics, but nor do they count as Sleepers for the sake of paradox.%0a%3c Unsafe Relinquishment%0a%3c Relinquishing a spell unsafely (with a willpower point) is an act of hubris at the Understanding level without an immediate need to. An inured spell is of course not affected by this.%0a%3c Clarification: Boons%0a%3c Fate spells that grant a boon cannot provide a Potency dice bonus to casting dice pools, even if the spell lists affecting spellcasting pools as its own Reach option. Dice Tricks (e.g 9-again) affect spellcasting normally if Reach is used.%0a%3c Clarification: Combined Spells%0a%3c Combined spells have the same factors (if their Primary differs, choose one), including specified targets/area, unless a Reach is spent to separate the Scale.%0a%3c Clarification: Nimbus Tilt%0a%3c Nimbus Tilts only affect those actively witnessing them, meaning those using Mage Sight (or other supernatural powers that can perceive it), or anyone when the Nimbus is deliberately flared; this also includes the offender when the Nimbus is used defensively. However, the mage flaring the Nimbus is not affected by their own Tilt in any case.%0a%3c Clarification: Resistance and Withstanding%0a%3c Merits and abilities that subtract from a type of power’s resisted dice pool instead raises Withstand by 1/2 the amount (round up) when dealing with spells.%0a%3c Merits and abilities that specifically treat the trait as higher just do exactly that.%0a%3c Clarification: Shielding Spells%0a%3c As listed in the Creative Thaumaturgy rules, Shielding spells will only protect against a number of supernatural effects equal to the spell’s potency for a given casting.%0a%3c Policy: Staff and Paradox%0a%3c Releasing Paradox always requires a staff member present to direct the paradox Reach; it’s recommended not to release paradox for downtime casting%0a%3c Internal Paradoxes require a staff member to be notified if more than 5 successes are rolled beyond what’s absorbed by Wisdom, as a new Paradox condition is likely to be needed.%0a%3c %0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Mortal House Rules and Clarifications%0a%3c New Merits%0a%3c Unseen Sense, Advanced (•••)%0a%3c Prerequisite%0a%3c Unseen Sense%0a%3c Effect%0a%3c Your characters sixth sense for a type of supernatural creature is increased. By spending a point of Willpower she can extend the range of her unseen senses to 100 yards. As with Unseen Sense, the player can accept the Spooked Condition, in exchange for which the character can pinpoint where the feeling is coming from; this reveals all triggers of it within that range. If the target is using a power that specifically cloaks its supernatural nature, however, this does not work (though the Condition remains until resolved as usual), nor does it work against powers that use mental illusions to conceal or otherwise hide the character.%0a%3c Unseen Sense, Epic (•••)%0a%3c Prerequisite%0a%3c Unseen Sense%0a%3c Effect%0a%3c Your characters sixth sense is increased to detect any supernatural creature, and she is able to distinguish between them. As with Unseen Sense, Advanced, the player can accept the Spooked Condition, in exchange for which the character can pinpoint where the feeling is coming from; this reveals all triggers of it within that range. If the target is using a power that specifically cloaks its supernatural nature, however, this does not work (though the Condition remains until resolved as usual), nor does it work against powers that use mental illusions to conceal or otherwise hide the character.%0a%3c Psychic Vampires%0a%3c Hunting%0a%3c For keeping track of Ephemera, use the Vampire rules for Hunting, listed here and in the Vampire Core where referenced, replacing Vitae with Ephemera, and gaining Empowered (Psychic Vampirism) instead of Sated on an exceptional.\\ If you lack the Vampire book, the hunting rules essentially involve putting together a dice pool for how you hunt, and then taking penalties (&#8722;2 each) for additional vessels being hunted with that roll. Ask the Rules Master for any clarifications needed on different traits. [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Vampire House Rules and Clarifications%0a%3c Vitae and Hunting%0a%3c The feeding and hunting systems, provided in Vampire: the Requiem 2nd Edition, are largely unchanged. However, there are a few house rules in place to make it easier to manage in a chat environment, both for players and Storymasters:%0a%3c %0a%3c It’s assumed all Kindred hunt for an average of 1 Vitae per night in their downtime, to counteract the loss of Vitae from waking from daysleep, so Vitae pools don’t decrease over time by default. Players otherwise keep track of their own Vitae pools from night to night.%0a%3c Note: If under the effect of any power or circumstance that would prevent you from ‘casually’ feeding with normal mechanics, you do NOT get the nightly Vitae back in downtime; any feeding methodologies will need to account for the nightly loss.%0a%3c A Vampire PC’s player may make one hunting roll per chapter (Week), using the system for ‘feeding scenes with dice’ on VtR2e page 96. Dramatic failure cannot be willingly taken, and an Exceptional success instead provides the Sated condition. If a Dramatic Failure is somehow naturally rolled, contact a Narrator.%0a%3c The vitae gained from the weekly roll can be applied throughout the week rather than all at once. For example, if you are down 2 vitae and a hunt gains 6 vitae, 2 vitae can be applied immediately and 4 remaining can be used to replenish any other losses for that week.%0a%3c 1 vessel = 3 vitae (or 7 with a breaking point).%0a%3c Vitae gained In-Character from other PCs or ST-NPCs works normally and has no effect on hunting rolls or visa versa. You may not, however, gain Vitae from retainers or similar merits in this way; if they’re willing to provide blood to you, buy Herd.%0a%3c If there’s any confusion about something might be affected by this, ask a Narrator (if in a scene) or the Rules Master.%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Blood Bonding%0a%3c Blood bonds may only be raised by 1 step per night via traditional feeding methods (powers that apply the blood bond are not limited in this way, however).%0a%3c Players are expected to give OOC notice if the scene or action has the intent to be to bond a character.%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Clarification: Auspex%0a%3c The sample questions for the first three levels are not your only options. You may ask anything relevant as described by that discipline.%0a%3c Lay Open the Mind and dreams: This works normally on someone sleeping (thus allowing dream-watching), but projected thoughts/images can’t override actual Dreamwalking, nor does it provide any such abilities beyond what’s listed in the Discipline.%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Clarification: Animalism%0a%3c While Feral Whispers allows communication with other supernatural creatures in animal forms, it can’t be used to command them.%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Clarification: Swarm Form%0a%3c Use the statistics in the Chronicles of Darkness 2e book, pg 121, for ‘Trained Guard Dog’ to determine your swarm’s base physical traits. The ‘Bite’ dice pool gives you your ‘Strength + Brawl’, and you can extrapolate a Brawl of 2 and Athletics of 3 if you need any other physical skills (the rest are 0).%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Clarification: Downgrading Damage%0a%3c The book isn’t entirely all-inclusive on what gets downgraded from aggravated to lethal or lethal to bashing. So, unless a power/ability (on either side) explicitly says otherwise, or a Narrator deems differently due to unique circumstances in a scene, the following rules apply:%0a%3c %0a%3c Fire/Sunlight damage is of course not downgraded, from any source.%0a%3c Any mundane source of aggravated or lethal damage is downgraded (including Fighting/Style merits, and Environmental Tilts).%0a%3c Direct supernatural sources that deal lethal damage (such as Nightmare 5 or the Mind Flay Mage spell) are not downgraded unless it works through mundane vectors like organ failure.%0a%3c Supernatural powers creating weapons, environmental tilts, or redirecting external forces (such as Telekinesis) are downgraded normally.%0a%3c Supernatural sources of aggravated damage are usually downgraded.%0a%3c Exception: Vampiric powers that say they deal aggravated damage deal aggravated damage even to Vampires, because they’re the basis within Vampire books.%0a%3c Supernatural powers that say Vampires may be immune, downgrade the damage, or otherwise suffer less harm at Storyteller discretion (like Mage’s Rend Lifespan) have that lesser effect on Vampires by default.%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Clarification: Tech-Savvy%0a%3c Tech-Savvy is for mundane, physical (or electronic) equipment. It cannot be used for ‘Mystical’/’Occult’ equipment, plans, repositories, creative works, etc. It CAN be used, of course, for labs and other tools that’d grant benefits to crafting those things, but will not benefit the end product directly.%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Grafting Unholy Flesh%0a%3c By default, a Graft created with Grafting Unholy Flesh will last only a number of uses equal to the Scale user’s dots in Zirnitra (minimum of 1). In the case of normally ‘permanent’ abilities, they’re reflexively activated for a scene as one ‘use’. After these uses, the part rots away.%0a%3c To keep a Graft permanently, you must buy the Graft (• - •••••) merit, which is not available at Creation. The cost is equal to 1xp per dot level of the power being grafted; in the case of powers with no ratings, this will default to 3 and be adjusted up or down by the staff on a case by case basis (which will be recorded as they’re decided on)%0a%3c Grafting Unholy Flesh doesn’t work on ‘innate’ abilities like a Werewolf’s shapeshifting or a Mage’s Sight.%0a%3c As well, certain NPC-type powers, such as certain Dread Powers, rare Numina, and similar may not be graftable at StoryMaster and Rules Master discretion. This is in addition to the existing restrictions against taking template abilities.%0a%3c Traits unique to the ‘donor’ template type use the donor’s rating for all dice pools and derived effects. Attributes, skills, and other trait types the Vampire DOES have access to use their own ratings (other than the grafted power rating itself, of course).%0a%3c If using this Scale to gain a Mage’s power, you choose from their Praxes or Rotes, not Arcana, though individual Attainments can be taken one for one as normal. Similarly, it can’t be used to gain Blood Sorcery dots, but can be used for individual Rituals.%0a%3c You must always submit an Action request when using this Scale, and keep track of the Health levels of any relevant parts. Any mechanical issues will be decided on a power by power basis.%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Werewolf House Rules and Clarifications%0a%3c Packs%0a%3c Pack Experiences are not in use%0a%3c Packs may be formed either pre-creation or IC, but only involves PCs or those directly represented with merits; no ‘Secondary’ characters are created. Totems are created normally.%0a%3c Packs do gain the normal 5 dots of Pack merits, but other dots must be purchased by individual characters contributing their personal Experiences.%0a%3c Hunting Natures are not in use, due to the difficulty of keeping track. No drawbacks or benefits of the conditions are gained.%0a%3c Packs may purchase and use Pack Tactics of any level as well as use them spontaneously, though the latter may only occur in a scene with a Storyteller, who will approve their use on the spot; this does not guarantee every staff member will allow the same one in the future.%0a%3c Tactics must be purchased via individual pack members contributing Experiences%0a%3c Developing learned Pack Tactics for purchase follows the same guidelines as other Custom Creations.%0a%3c To clarify, the Primal Instincts Tell is required for Wolf-Blooded to participate in Pack Tactics. Non-Werewolves otherwise cannot do so.%0a%3c Wolf-Blooded Changing to Another Faction/Template%0a%3c Former Wolf-Blooded characters retain ONE tell when changing into anything besides a Werewolf. Any additional Tells purchased are lost with all other Wolf-Blooded merits.%0a%3c %0a%3c Thrice Born Merit & Clarification%0a%3c Definition%0a%3c A Thrice-Born is a wolf-blood with two very specific tells: Second Skin and Shadow Twin. The other component to being Thrice-Born is the culture in which their gifts are cultivated. Simply having the right combination of Tells is not enough. Thrice-Born are raised with duty and service to the Uratha and their culture. Thrice-born believe that they are a special part of Uratha culture, where the Wolf, the Man and the Spirit are born in separate, distinct forms. Because they have this unique perspective of what it is to be a servant of Luna, then they are duty bound to serve and fight.%0a%3c %0a%3c There are specific drawbacks and benefits to being a Thrice-Born. Thrice-Born are raised in a militaristic manner, a very hierarchical familial group who expects them to serve the Uratha as warriors, and scouts, and keeps their arcane education at the forefront of that. After all, sending the ignorant into battle is a surefire way to make sure they die first.%0a%3c %0a%3c They are expected to serve All Uratha as their assistance is called upon, and they are not allowed to pick and choose their battles. As they are servants to all, they will not get involved in conflicts between packs. They do not claim territory. They do not join packs, except with other Thrice-born or packs exclusive to their familial group, who understand the duty they must do.%0a%3c %0a%3c Thrice-Born Can and Do undergo the first change. Unlike other Wolfbloods, when the Thrice-born first changes into an Uratha, they will lose both Shadow Twin and Second Skin tells. They are no longer Thrice-Born, as those separate aspects have joined into one, complete being. As such, the other Thrice-Born will still pay them honor as having shared in their struggles and run as a servant, but will no longer count them among their numbers.%0a%3c %0a%3c NEW Wolfblooded ONLY Merit: THRICE BORN (**)%0a%3c Wolfblood Only Merit - to be listed publicly on wiki and sheets %0a%3c Prerequisites: Shadow Twin (Tell), Second Skin (Tell) %0a%3c Optional: Family Status-Hayes%0a%3c %0a%3c Benefits%0a%3c The Thrice Born Merit identifies a Blooded as a Thrice-Born. There are benefits to this%0a%3c %0a%3c .	+2 in assist/teamwork rolls with Werewolves and their allies.%0a%3c .	+1 to persuasion rolls among the Uratha of Portland.%0a%3c .	&#8722;2 to those in the Werewolf faction initiating hostile actions upon the wolfblood. Follow up hostile actions have no penalty.%0a%3c Drawbacks%0a%3c There are drawbacks as well:%0a%3c %0a%3c .	They can only join packs with other Thrice-Born or PC’s with Family Status-Hayes%0a%3c .	They cannot take the Neighborhood Merit, even as pack members.%0a%3c .	They cannot hold Territories, as they are servants to all Uratha.%0a%3c .	If the Wolfblood undergoes the First Change, they will lose both the Second Skin and Shadow Twin merits, as well as the Thrice-Born merit, as they are no longer considered Thrice-Born.%0a%3c The First Change-Mechanics%0a%3c When a Thrice Born undergoes the First Change, they are no longer considered Thrice-Born. Unlike other blooded changes, they lose both Second Skin and Spirit Twin tells. XP spent for those merits will be refunded back.They will retain a permanent dot of status in the Hayes family, or gain a second to reflect their service as a Thrice-Born. (Note: only if the change happens IC. This does not apply to Uratha who started the game as changed Thrice-Born. This applies to characters created after this merit was implemented, and will not be applied to current characters who have thrice-born in their background, OR to characters who started the game thrice-born and underwent the first change. It is meant for those who purchased the merit “thrice born” only.)%0a%3c %0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Status: Hayes Family%0a%3c Requirements: Thrice Born and/or Last name Hayes%0a%3c %0a%3c Ronald Hayes has indoctrinated you into the family. You gain access to use the family Locus freely. This also comes with free housing at the Hayes family estate as well as a family that will back you up through thick and thicker.%0a%3c You did something of note that even the Forsaken talks about. This does not go without notice in the family and they talk of your praise. You gain 1 dot of resources as well as the access to the family’s Library. Your access to the library will increase as your status does, and provides an equipment bonus equal to Status: Hayes for appropriate research rolls.%0a%3c The Thrice Born has work to further the family and help Forsaken as well. You have really done your part to help as best you can. Ronald had noticed your work and wants to help you get stronger. You gain Favored Form at 2 dots for any form. (Note that only those Thrice Born with the family name may go above Status 3. There are very extreme circumstances for someone without the family name to move beyond this point.)%0a%3c You are now one of the top members of the family. There are not many of you, but if you got here, you deserved it, you worked for it with your own sweat and blood. Hayes and other higher members of the family teach you why the Thrice-born are not to be trifled with. They are not just money and family, they are fierce warriors as well. You can access to Fortified Form (3 dot version) for whichever form you choose. You must still meet the requirements of Fortified Form to use it. This stacks if Fortified Form is already taken for one form (Max of the 5 dot version)%0a%3c Disclosed. Only Ronald and his daughter Claire have this level of status at the moment.%0a%3c Drawback: Thrice born cannot take the Neighborhood merit as the Estate is all the family cares about. Thrice Born within the family shall not form packs with non-Thrice Born and Hayes family members.%0a%3c %0a%3c Exiled members can not take Status Hayes family but may take the Neighborhood merit.%0a%3c %0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Directory: Game Reference%0a%3c Book Policy	House Rules	Character Creation	Sanctioning	Experience Guide	Code of Conduct	Site Policies And Practices%0a%3c %0a%3c Portland, OR %0a%3c Districts%0a%3c %0a%3c Changeling %0a%3c Player Guide%0a%3c %0a%3c Mage %0a%3c Player Guide%0a%3c %0a%3c Mortal %0a%3c Player Guide%0a%3c %0a%3c Vampire %0a%3c Player Guide%0a%3c %0a%3c Werewolf %0a%3c Player Guide%0a%3c Edit - History - Print - Recent Changes - Search%0a%3c Page last modified on November 20, 2017, at 03:15 PM%0a%3c The Storytelling System, Beast the Primordial, Changeling the Lost, Chronicles of Darkness, Demon the Descent, Mage the Awakening, Vampire the Requiem, and Werewolf the Forsaken ©2014-2016 CCP hf and published by Onyx Path Publishing.%0a%3c Produced by Jeff Vandenberg.
