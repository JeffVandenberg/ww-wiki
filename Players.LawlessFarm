As a surname, Lovelace came from a nickname for a person who was an outlaw or was uncontrolled or unrestrained. The Gaelic form of the surname Lovelace is Laighléis.%0a%0aThe name Lawless Farm is an old family tradition for the Lovelace family, dating back over four decades in Savannah GA.

Either they'd been abused, starved, or just generally mistreated and unloved.  All of them but Sawyer seem to be completely recovered.  Sawyer's stall inside has fully enclosed walls instead of the bars.  He is starting to get along with Strey it seems.  Diesel was a carriage horse in downtown Savannah, when Lux found him he was all skin and bones and still working.  Strey was overworked with strained hocks and cuts on his sides from whips and spurs.  The scars are still there but healed now.  Tux had overgrown hooves and his mane and tail was completely dreadlocked and had to be shaved.   Remy came along with Sawyer, she is pregnant by Sawyer and soon to drop her foal.  She has finally been brought to a healthy weight.   Sawyer was overbred and a danger to handle for most people, he still has some scars around his mouth and his sides from the abuse of his former owners.  Ghost was a former reining and cutting horse that was a big winner until he was sold at auction and put as a trail horse.  He was also underfed and his feet badly in need of trimming until Lux bought him.%0a%0a||! %25color=#6E227C%25Image ||! %25color=#6E227C%25Name ||! %25color=#6E227C%25Breed ||! %25color=#6E227C%25Gender ||! %25color=#6E227C%25Personality ||%0a|| %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/ZrRfg2b.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/ZrRfg2b.jpg]] || Diesel || Clydesdale || Gelding || Sweet tempered former carriage horse, was also abused before Lux bought him ||%0a|| %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/FS633CW.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/FS633CW.jpg]] || Strey || Thoroughbred || Gelding || Easy to ride jumper, very fond of cookies ||%0a|| %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/v35BPKC.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/v35BPKC.jpg]] || Tux || Welsh Pony || Gelding || Sweet paint pony, has a bowtie marking on his chest ||%0a|| %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/LiLL2jK.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/LiLL2jK.jpg]] || Remy || Oldenburg || Mare || Retired jumper, currently pregnant ||%0a|| %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/XNZTF95.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/XNZTF95.jpg]] || Sawyer || Holsteiner || Stallion || Recovering abused, stallion, very high strung ||%0a|| %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/fDdITUd.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/fDdITUd.jpg]] || Ghost || Quarter Horse || Gelding || Former reining and cutting, big bay roan ||%0a%0aOther Animals on the farm include Dairy and Beef cattle, along with chickens in a good-sized coop.

All of them but Sawyer seem to be completely recovered.  Sawyer's stall inside has fully enclosed walls instead of the bars.  He is starting to get along with Strey it seems.  Diesel was a carriage horse in downtown Savannah, when Lux found him he was all skin and bones and still working.  Strey was overworked with strained hocks and cuts on his sides from whips and spurs.  The scars are still there but healed now.  Tux had overgrown hooves and his mane and tail was completely dreadlocked and had to be shaved.   Remy came along with Sawyer, she is pregnant by Sawyer and soon to drop her foal.  She has finally been brought to a healthy weight.   Sawyer was overbred and a danger to handle for most people, he still has some scars around his mouth and his sides from the abuse of his former owners.  Ghost was a former reining and cutting horse that was a big winner until he was sold at auction and put as a trail horse.  He was also underfed and his feet badly in need of trimming until Lux bought him.%0a%3c %0a121c119%0a%3c || %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/FS633CW.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/FS633CW.jpg]] || Strey || Thoroughbred || Gelding || Easy to ride jumper, very fond of cookies ||%0a---%0a> || %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/FS633CW.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/FS633CW.jpg]] || Strey || Throughbred || Gelding || Easy to ride jumper, very fond of cookies ||%0a
