Frequented by locals as well as visitors, it's quieter than beaches to the south, but just as beautiful. You will find locals and visitors enjoying the sand and surf, with plenty of space to open up and spread out. The beach is wide and sandy, with concessions and showers. The boardwalk becomes a flat trail here, and winds its way up to Surfside on a path that’s popular with runners, bikers, and dog-walkers from the neighborhood.%0a%0aSmall but mighty, this high-end village in Miami is known as a getaway for the rich and famous, with plenty of luxury shops, elegant hotels, five-star restaurants, and pristine beaches. Luckily, you don’t have to be a resident to enjoy the luxe lifestyle. Whether you’re there for a day or a weekend, you’ll stay busy with the perfect blend of indoor and outdoor entertainment, fabulous views, and varied activities that will leave you feeling both relaxed and invigorated with the spirit of splendor.%0a%0aSince the 1920s, the Detroit-based Miami Beach Heights Corporation – headed by industrialists Robert C. Graham, Walter O. Briggs, and Carl G. Fisher – owned 245 acres (0.99 km2) of undeveloped, partially swampy land that stretched from the bay to the Atlantic. Mr. Graham assumed the duties as the developer for Bal Harbour. In the 1930s, city planners Harland Bartholomew & Associates were called in to design the Village. The company made several plans and they were submitted to the Miami Beach Heights for review.%0a%0aSwampland was filled, sea walls were constructed and the yacht basin was created. Contracts were signed for the sewer systems, water pumping stations and utilities. Bal Harbour was the first planned community in Florida to have its utilities placed underground. Developers set guidelines for the development of the beachfront and the residential areas. Collins Avenue was paved into four lanes with a landscaped median and later widened to the present day six lanes. Village plans indicated that ocean front property was to be 200 feet (61 m) deep and lots approached $100,000. Lots in the residential area were about 1,800 square feet (170 m2) and cost from $6,500 to $20,000.%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a[[#to]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Bal Harbour''%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/MXoZMcu.jpg%0aThe original name chosen for Bal Harbour was Bay Harbour. However, the planning committee didn't think that was appropriate for a city that was on the beach. A name was invented to encompass a village that ran from the bay to the Atlantic Ocean. The "b" was taken from the word bay and the "a" and "l" were taken from the name Atlantic. Hence the word "Bal" was created.%0a%0aIn 1940, World War II began and the plans were put on hold. As a goodwill gesture to the government, Robert C. Graham rented the land to the United States Air Corps for $1 per year. The Air Corps used this land to train their soldiers and established a Prisoner of War camp. The ocean front area was used as a rifle range and the barracks were set up on the west side of Collins Avenue. The camp for prisoners was located where the Bal Harbour Shops are presently.%0a%0aIn 1945, the war was over in both Germany and Japan. The Air Corps left the barracks buildings as a thank you to the owners of the property. These barracks were converted into apartment homes by Mr. Graham in 1946.%0a%0aIn order to incorporate a city in 1946, there had to be at least 25 male registered voters residing in the area. Mr. Graham had twenty five families move into the apartment homes that he had converted in order to qualify the Village for incorporation. He then hired Willard Webb, a Miami Beach tax assessor, to draft a charter for the Village. After the charter was completed, the Village of Bal Harbour was incorporated on August 14, 1946, by Mr. Graham and 25 male registered voters. The Village was operated under the city manager form of government.%0a%0aThe Council established a volunteer fire department.%0a%0aThe first hotel was built and was named "The Kenilworth By-the-Sea."

It was built by Mr. Robert C. Graham Jr. who was the son of Bal Harbour Developer Robert C. Graham. Construction for the Sea View Hotel was started.%0a%0aBal Harbour Village was re-incorporated by a special act of the 1947 Florida Legislature and its own charter was issued June 16.

The population was 5,628 at the 2010 census. It is separated from the mainland by Biscayne Bay, over which the land masses are connected via the Broad Causeway. On the mainland side, BHI is bordered by the city of North Miami, while to the east it borders the villages of Bal Harbour and Surfside. To the south lies the exclusive village of Indian Creek. BHI is about 20 minutes' driving distance away from Miami International Airport, and it is situated between the larger cities of Aventura and Miami Beach.%0aBHI was founded by Shepard Broad on April 28, 1947. It consists of two islands: originally known as Broadview and Bay Harbor, now referred to as, respectively, the West and East Islands. The West Island features single family homes, while the East Island contains the business district, a K-8 school, and multi-family housing.%0aThe East Island of Bay Harbor features one of the largest concentrated collections of mid-century Miami Modern architecture of the 1940s and 1950s, including historic buildings designed by Morris Lapidus, Henry Hohauser, and Charles McKirahan.%0a%0aIn 2014, the National Trust for Historic Preservation named Bay Harbor's East Island to its annual list of the "11 Most Endangered Historic Places" in America because the island's architecture was coming under pressure from development. Two members of the town council responded to the listing by questioning the need to preserve the buildings. Some residents, in turn, criticized council members for as lack of attention to historic preservation.%0a%0a%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' •••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Indian Creek''%25%25%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/UVmR4F9.jpg%0aIndian Creek is an exclusive 300-acre island located on the beautiful waters of Biscayne Bay, and recognized as one of the wealthiest, private, most secure communities in Miami Beach, and the world. The high level of privacy and security is the highest priority to the residents of Indian Creek and maintained by having a State of Florida police force, as well as its own 24/7 armed marine patrol monitoring the waters surrounding the island.%0a%0aIt is not uncommon for Indian Creek Island to make an impression or make real estate headlines with the rich and famous residents who make it their home. These include Spanish singer Julio Iglesias, whose $28 Million home made it on the Top 10 List of Most Expensive Homes in the South in 2006 Forbes Magazine; pro golfer Raymond Floyd, former football coach of the Miami Dolphins Don Shula, television host Don Francisco, billionaire investor Carl Icahn, real estate billionaire Peter Breton, Victoria Secret’s model Adriana Lima, co-founder of Calvin Klein Barry Schwartz, Sheik Mohammed al-Fassi of Saudi Arabia, billionaire developer Donny Soffer, steel executive Leroy Schecter, wireless executive Rajendra Singh, radio magnate Raul Alarcon, former cable company CEO Ken Bagwell, US Senator George Smathers, coal and oil executive Christopher F. Viegas, former football team owner and billionaire art collector Norman Braman, just to name a few who make up this affluent community. In August 2012, Forbes Magazine featured a home sold on Indian Creek as the most expensive home sale in the history of Miami-Dade County.%0a%0aWith only 41 luxury, waterfront residences surrounded by lush gardens, these spectacular homes feature resort-style pools, poolside cabanas, rooftop Jacuzzis, full spas, gyms, wine cellars, entertainment theaters, accentuated with lavish furnishings and the finest accessories. The amenities at Indian Creek include an 18-hole golf course, considered one of the finest and occupying the interior of the island with a few holes on the waterfront, and an elite country club. Just minutes away via 91st Street, you have the neighborhood of Surfside, the nearby conveniences and fine dining on Miami Beach, and shopping at the prestigious Bal Harbour Shops.%0a%0aIndian Creek is a magnificent parade of palatial homes exuding extravagance, with panoramic, breathtaking views of Biscayne Bay, the skyline of Downtown Miami, and a premier location of South Florida and the world.%0a%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''North Bay Village''%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/gC8K21Z.jpg%0aPrior to 1940, most of what is now North Bay Village lay beneath the waters of Biscayne Bay. The only dry land was Broadcast Key, a 5-acre (20,000 m2) island from which pioneer radio station WIOD began broadcasting in 1926. Today, television station WSVN-TV maintains its headquarters at this same site, now joined with Treasure Island.%0a%0aIn 1940, dredging and bulk-heading created North Bay Island. By 1941, palm-lined streets had been laid out, and 12 homes had been built and occupied. Today, the island has grown into a lush neighborhood of attractive single-family residences.%0a%0aDuring the mid-1940s, dredging and filling created Harbor Island and Treasure Island. Harbor Island is composed primarily of multi-family buildings. Treasure Island, whose street names were drawn from Robert Louis Stevenson's novel Treasure Island, is a mixture of single-family dwellings on the westerly end and multi-family dwellings on the eastern end.%0a%0aNorth Bay Village was incorporated in 1945. Harbor and Treasure Islands were annexed several years later. Broadcast Key, also known as Cameo Island, was annexed in 1963. During its early years, North Bay Village was primarily a haven for winter residents. The City became widely known for its popular restaurants and nightclubs, which attracted celebrities like Frank Sinatra and Judy Garland. Dean Martin had a night-club in North Bay Village in the late 1960s and early 1970s called Dino's. It was next to Jilly Rizzo's club, Jilly's.%0a%0aMost of today's residents live here year-round. North Bay Village continues to be home to several of South Florida's most popular restaurants, as well as a variety of business enterprises, apartment buildings, condominiums and 376 single-family homes."%0a%0aMost construction in North Bay Village since the year 2000 has been in the development of high-rise luxury condominium buildings such as the 360 condominium, Space 01 Condo, Eloquence on the Bay, and Grandview Palace Marina%0a%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' •••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''North Beach''%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/uXoES9R.jpg%0a%0aThis northern stretch of Miami Beach includes a community center, an adjoining park at the north end and an old fashioned band shell — the North Beach Bandshell — a historic, open-air amphitheater built in 1961. It was restored to its original splendor within the last decade, and has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places as a prime example of Miami Modern (MiMo) architecture. A popular Miami Beach music venue, the bandshell currently hosts regular concerts from around the world, and for almost sixty years, it has brought people together in the spirit of community, culture and entertainment. Interesting fact: The North Beach Bandshell sits on the site of Miami Beach’s first structure, the Biscayne House of Refuge, which was built in 1875 by the United States Life-Saving Service (now the Coast Guard) to rescue shipwrecked sailors. There is even a small monument on the site.%0a%0a%0aWhere many of Miami’s beaches sit in the shadow of hotels and waterfront properties, North Shore Open Space Park stands apart, as it is a preserve of natural tree canopies and winding walkways. Filled with picnic tables, grills, playgrounds and lush greenery, it delivers what its name promises — open space. Most weekends you’ll find families hosting parties and locals running or biking through the park.

Graham, Walter O. Briggs, and Carl G. Fisher – owned 245 acres (0.99 km2) of undeveloped, partially swampy land that stretched from the bay to the Atlantic. Mr. Graham assumed the duties as the developer for Bal Harbour. In the 1930s, city planners Harland Bartholomew & Associates were called in to design the Village. The company made several plans and they were submitted to the Miami Beach Heights for review.%0a> %0a> The original name chosen for Bal Harbour was Bay Harbour. However, the planning committee didn't think that was appropriate for a city that was on the beach. A name was invented to encompass a village that ran from the bay to the Atlantic Ocean. The "b" was taken from the word bay and the "a" and "l" were taken from the name Atlantic. Hence the word "Bal" was created.%0a> %0a> In 1940, World War II began and the plans were put on hold. As a goodwill gesture to the government, Robert C. Graham rented the land to the United States Air Corps for $1 per year. The Air Corps used this land to train their soldiers and established a Prisoner of War camp. The ocean front area was used as a rifle range and the barracks were set up on the west side of Collins Avenue. The camp for prisoners was located where the Bal Harbour Shops are presently.%0a> %0a> In 1945, the war was over in both Germany and Japan. The Air Corps left the barracks buildings as a thank you to the owners of the property. These barracks were converted into apartment homes by Mr. Graham in 1946.%0a> %0a> In order to incorporate a city in 1946, there had to be at least 25 male registered voters residing in the area. Mr. Graham had twenty five families move into the apartment homes that he had converted in order to qualify the Village for incorporation. He then hired Willard Webb, a Miami Beach tax assessor, to draft a charter for the Village. After the charter was completed, the Village of Bal Harbour was incorporated on August 14, 1946, by Mr. Graham and 25 male registered voters. The Village was operated under the city manager form of government.%0a> %0a> The Council established a volunteer fire department.%0a> %0a> Swampland was filled, sea walls were constructed and the yacht basin was created. Contracts were signed for the sewer systems, water pumping stations and utilities. Bal Harbour was the first planned community in Florida to have its utilities placed underground. Developers set guidelines for the development of the beachfront and the residential areas. Collins Avenue was paved into four lanes with a landscaped median and later widened to the present day six lanes. Village plans indicated that ocean front property was to be 200 feet (61 m) deep and lots approached $100,000. Lots in the residential area were about 1,800 square feet (170 m2) and cost from $6,500 to $20,000.%0a> %0a> The first hotel was built and was named "The Kenilworth By-the-Sea." It was built by Tom Raffington and made famous by Arthur Godfrey. It has since been demolished and is now the Kenilworth Condominium. The first home was built at 160 Bal Cross Drive. It was built by Mr. Robert C. Graham Jr. who was the son of Bal Harbour Developer Robert C. Graham. Construction for the Sea View Hotel was started.%0a> %0a> Bal Harbour Village was re-incorporated by a special act of the 1947 Florida Legislature and its own charter was issued June 16. This new charter supplemented the original incorporation under the General Laws of Florida. In accordance with the new charter, an election to select five to serve on the Council was held June 30. The Council elected were: Edward L. Bonneau, Robert C. Graham, Jr., Glenn E. Massnick, George Whittaker, and Judge Julien Southerland. Judge Southerland was chosen as mayor. Willard Webb, who had been acting manager since the first organization, was appointed as Village Manager. Mary Wetterer was named Village Clerk and Herold Dickey was appointed Chief of Police.%0a> %0a> In 1947, the Church by the Sea was built. In 1948, the Beach Club was built. Its restaurant was operated by Howard Johnson's. In 1949, a new bridge was started over Baker Haulover.%0a> %0a> In 1956, the current Village Hall was built. In 1956, the Hotel Americana was built. It became the Sheraton Hotel in 1980. It was imploded on November 18, 2007 to build a set of condos and a luxury aparthotel as the St. Regis. In 1959, Bal Harbour's beach was renovated due to severe erosion.%0a> %0a> In 1965, the Bal Harbour Shops was built by the Whitman family. Stanley Whitman was one of the incorporators who lived with his family in the barrack apartments. In 1971, Bal Harbour's beach started a major renourishment project. In 1984, the residents of an exclusive neighborhood in Bal Harbour were successfully sued to remove the clause preventing Jews and blacks from owning property there.%0a> %0a> In 2008, The new Regent Bal Harbour opened, becoming the northern gateway to the Village. In 2012, The last oceanfront undeveloped Beach Club site was sold for $220 million in order to make way to the ultra luxury Oceana at Bal Harbour. In 2014, The Ritz-Carlton Bal Harbour, Miami opens at the former Regent Bal Harbour and ONE Bal Harbour Resort & Spa.%0a> %0a> In 2015, it was reported in the press that "the Bal Harbour Police and the Glades County Sheriff set up a giant money laundering scheme, but it all fell apart when federal investigators and the Miami Herald found strange things going on."%0a> %0a> %0a174c173%0a%3c !!!!'''Average Resources''' ••••%0a---%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' ••• to ••••%0a

During that time, Northeast Broadway, one of the district’s main thoroughfares, evolved naturally into a busy strip of restaurants and shops needed to support Portland’s growing eastside population. Although modern automobile travel and convenient MAX light rail service render many of the Northeast neighborhoods a quick 7-10 -minute jaunt to Portland’s downtown core, Northeast Portland seems charmingly detached from the bustle of the city center.%0a> %0a> The seeds of gentrification were planted during World War II, when African Americans from the South flowed into Portland to take jobs in the shipyards. Portland officials and community members, from real estate agents to bankers, pushed the black community into a small area called Lower Albina, near the present-day Rose Quarter, through redlining and other now-illegal practices. White Portlanders fled, and the city began a long pattern of disinvestment. Street and sidewalk repairs were neglected, and the city did little to develop businesses or enforce housing codes, said Dr. Karen Gibson, the PSU professor, who wrote a study in 2007 called Bleeding Albina: A History of Community Disinvestment, 1940-2000.%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25''Farmers Markets''%0a> %0a> *'''Hollywood Farmers Market''' ''Northeast Hancock Street between 44th and 45th avenues.

Boise is bordered by the following neighborhoods:  Humboldt to the north, King to the east, Eliot to the south, and Overlook to the west.%0a> %0a> In the mid-1980s, maybe 5-6 businesses were operating on the five-block North Mississippi Avenue commercial strip between Fremont and Skidmore streets in the Boise neighborhood of North Portland.%0a> %0a> It was a grim place! You name it, N. Mississippi had it: drugs, gangs, street crime, prostitution, abandoned houses — all the elements of urban decay. Today, there are more than 40 businesses on the street. Restaurants, coffee shops, a bike shop, a nursery, furniture makers, a home rebuilding center, and even a couple of recording studios.%0a> %0a> What happened? For one thing, in 1999 the city of Portland created the Mississippi Historic District Target Area to improve public safety, upgrade housing and attract businesses. The city brought an army of bureaucratic tools — including home improvement loans, technical assistance, and help — in dealing with the new designation. And the results are now starting to play out.%0a> %0a> Has the effort been a success? The city hasn’t succeeded entirely in making sure that gentrification doesn’t drive out existing residents. Yes, crime and drugs are down while optimism is up. But the area still deals with undercurrents of racial and class mistrust in one of Oregon’s poorest and most diverse neighborhoods. Changes are happening quickly. People walk to the shops by day; at night, live music can be found at the Mississippi Pizza Pub where crowds and the music spill out onto the sidewalk on warm evenings.%0a> %0a> The new Interstate MAX line is three blocks away, and neighbors hope that the low rents will attract more young artists who will help continue the revival. More than 60 percent of the neighborhood today is under 35, census figures show.%0a> %0a> !!!%25center%25'''Mississippi Avenue Street Fair'''%0a> %0a> The Mississippi Avenue Street Fair began in 2001 as a simple community-building event called the Boise-Eliot Multicultural Fair. The one-day event has since become Portland biggest street fair — attracting thousands and sprawling over five city blocks in the heart of the Historic Mississippi Avenue Business District.%0a> %0a> The attractions have grown along with the fair and there are now multiple stages of entertainment with nearly 30 acts performing.

The population was 5,628 at the 2010 census. It is separated from the mainland by Biscayne Bay, over which the land masses are connected via the Broad Causeway. On the mainland side, BHI is bordered by the city of North Miami, while to the east it borders the villages of Bal Harbour and Surfside. To the south lies the exclusive village of Indian Creek. BHI is about 20 minutes' driving distance away from Miami International Airport, and it is situated between the larger cities of Aventura and Miami Beach.%0a%3c BHI was founded by Shepard Broad on April 28, 1947. It consists of two islands: originally known as Broadview and Bay Harbor, now referred to as, respectively, the West and East Islands. The West Island features single family homes, while the East Island contains the business district, a K-8 school, and multi-family housing.%0a%3c The East Island of Bay Harbor features one of the largest concentrated collections of mid-century Miami Modern architecture of the 1940s and 1950s, including historic buildings designed by Morris Lapidus, Henry Hohauser, and Charles McKirahan.%0a%3c %0a%3c In 2014, the National Trust for Historic Preservation named Bay Harbor's East Island to its annual list of the "11 Most Endangered Historic Places" in America because the island's architecture was coming under pressure from development. Two members of the town council responded to the listing by questioning the need to preserve the buildings. Some residents, in turn, criticized council members for as lack of attention to historic preservation.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Eliot''%0a> %0a> As you can see on the map, Eliot is full of popular dining establishments, as well as two coffee shops, music venues, parks, and the Matt Dishman community center with in-door swimming pool, and plenty of bus stops for public transportation.  This is a great close-in Portland community with access to everything you need.  The bike corridors along Williams and Vancouver contribute to easy bike commutes.%0a> %0a> Eliot is a diverse community that is struggling to hold on to its history while fending off too much commercial urban redevelopment. Many of the residents of Eliot have lived here a long time, contributing to the sense of neighborhood pride and history of the area. There is a mix of residential and commercial property in Eliot, and the residential areas are generally attractive, quiet and livable, while the commercial areas are being actively redeveloped, bringing an influx of interest and energy that has both positive and negative aspects for the community. The residents are proud and protective of their special neighborhood and will actively fight any undesirable influx of commercial business that isn't viewed as a benefit to the neighborhood (witnessed recently when McDonald's tried unsuccessfully to move into the area). Given Eliot's excellent location to downtown, it will be interesting to see how the area grows and develops in the future. Some speculate the East side of the river holds even more potential than the former warehouse area now known as The Pearl District, because there is more affordable single-family residential housing available%0a> %0a> Eliot is located close-in on the East side of the Willamette across the river from the Pearl District. Eliot is an urban neighborhood with cultural diversity. Home styles in this area consist of older Victorian cottages and other older East Portland styles that have historic charm and character you just can't find in the newer 'burbs. While some streets are still rough around the edges, there are many charming homes tucked into the Eliot neighborhood.  Here you will still find the early 1900s sidewalks imprinted with the names of the original craftsmen, with metal curb rings for tethering horses along the streets.  There are also recent infill houses and condos being built in the area, so you can actually find a newer home if that is your preference.  Eliot is very conveniently located for an easy commute, and it's popularity is growing as people rediscover North/Northeast Portland, and especially as the TriMet light rail expansion will bring the streetcar to the edge of Eliot.  Eliot is becoming something of a destination for good eats in Portland.  From Russell Street Barbeque, Queen of Sheba Ethiopian, and the new Afrique restaurant, there is plenty to choose from.%0a> %0a106a124%0a> *[[Players.TheDreamhold|%25changeling%25The Dreamhold]]%0a108,110c126,127%0a%3c *%0a%3c !!!!'''Average Resources''' •••%0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a> %0a118,124c135,148%0a%3c !!%25center%25''Surfside''%0a%3c %0a%3c Surfside is Miami’s small beachside town.

Incorporated in 1935 with the signatures of just 35 local residents, Surfside has retained its vision of a small oceanfront community focused on residents, local businesses, and tourism.

Grant Park is conveniently located along Tri Met bus lines, and relatively close-in to Downtown Portland. The Grant Park community has a family-friendly feel, with quiet, residential streets lined with comfortable family homes.  The gem of the neighborhood is Grant Park, with large mature trees, and a nice playground, as well as a dog park area.  Grant Park adjoins Grant High School, and has lit tennis courts, a pool, a track, and lots of playground equipment for kids. Grant Park is conveniently located near coffee shops, restaurants, and shopping in popular commercial areas lining Broadway, and along Fremont St. in the Beaumont-Wilshire, Irvington and Alameda neighborhoods.  Also nearby in the Hollywood district, you will find additional shops, restaurants, and the popular neighborhood Trader Joe's market.%0a> %0a> Besides visiting the park, neighbors also enjoy walking through the hills behind 35th and Siskiyou for beautiful views, and exploring the hillside stairwells that take you to the top of the stunning Alameda Ridge.  Definitely drive under the trees on Knott Street between 33rd and 42nd Avenues in spring time to enjoy the show of cherry blossoms, and in the fall to enjoy the maple leaves!  Also, this is an excellent neighborhood for summertime yard sales.  Grant Park offers a wide range of home styles, from classic Old Portland style homes to Craftsman Cottages, Cape Codes, Bungalows, Colonials and more.

Funded by donations from Cleary fans, the park was built by the Friends of Henry and Ramona. It includes life-sized renditions by local sculptor Lee Hunt of three Cleary characters: Ramona Quimby, Henry Huggins, and Ribsy (Henry's dog). The life-sized sculptures were created using vintage clothes on wax models to create a realistic feel. The sculpture of Ramona is dressed in raincoat and boots, with a joyous expression, and is positioned such that she splashes in the garden's fountain.

Luckily, you don’t have to be a resident to enjoy the luxe lifestyle. Whether you’re there for a day or a weekend, you’ll stay busy with the perfect blend of indoor and outdoor entertainment, fabulous views, and varied activities that will leave you feeling both relaxed and invigorated with the spirit of splendor.%0a%3c %0a%3c Since the 1920s, the Detroit-based Miami Beach Heights Corporation – headed by industrialists Robert C. Graham, Walter O. Briggs, and Carl G. Fisher – owned 245 acres (0.99 km2) of undeveloped, partially swampy land that stretched from the bay to the Atlantic. Mr. Graham assumed the duties as the developer for Bal Harbour. In the 1930s, city planners Harland Bartholomew & Associates were called in to design the Village. The company made several plans and they were submitted to the Miami Beach Heights for review.%0a%3c %0a%3c The original name chosen for Bal Harbour was Bay Harbour. However, the planning committee didn't think that was appropriate for a city that was on the beach. A name was invented to encompass a village that ran from the bay to the Atlantic Ocean. The "b" was taken from the word bay and the "a" and "l" were taken from the name Atlantic. Hence the word "Bal" was created.%0a%3c %0a%3c In 1940, World War II began and the plans were put on hold. As a goodwill gesture to the government, Robert C. Graham rented the land to the United States Air Corps for $1 per year. The Air Corps used this land to train their soldiers and established a Prisoner of War camp. The ocean front area was used as a rifle range and the barracks were set up on the west side of Collins Avenue. The camp for prisoners was located where the Bal Harbour Shops are presently.%0a%3c %0a%3c In 1945, the war was over in both Germany and Japan. The Air Corps left the barracks buildings as a thank you to the owners of the property. These barracks were converted into apartment homes by Mr. Graham in 1946.%0a%3c %0a%3c In order to incorporate a city in 1946, there had to be at least 25 male registered voters residing in the area. Mr. Graham had twenty five families move into the apartment homes that he had converted in order to qualify the Village for incorporation. He then hired Willard Webb, a Miami Beach tax assessor, to draft a charter for the Village. After the charter was completed, the Village of Bal Harbour was incorporated on August 14, 1946, by Mr. Graham and 25 male registered voters. The Village was operated under the city manager form of government.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Council established a volunteer fire department.%0a%3c %0a%3c Swampland was filled, sea walls were constructed and the yacht basin was created. Contracts were signed for the sewer systems, water pumping stations and utilities. Bal Harbour was the first planned community in Florida to have its utilities placed underground. Developers set guidelines for the development of the beachfront and the residential areas. Collins Avenue was paved into four lanes with a landscaped median and later widened to the present day six lanes. Village plans indicated that ocean front property was to be 200 feet (61 m) deep and lots approached $100,000. Lots in the residential area were about 1,800 square feet (170 m2) and cost from $6,500 to $20,000.%0a%3c %0a%3c The first hotel was built and was named "The Kenilworth By-the-Sea." It was built by Tom Raffington and made famous by Arthur Godfrey. It has since been demolished and is now the Kenilworth Condominium. The first home was built at 160 Bal Cross Drive. It was built by Mr. Robert C. Graham Jr. who was the son of Bal Harbour Developer Robert C. Graham. Construction for the Sea View Hotel was started.%0a%3c %0a%3c Bal Harbour Village was re-incorporated by a special act of the 1947 Florida Legislature and its own charter was issued June 16. This new charter supplemented the original incorporation under the General Laws of Florida. In accordance with the new charter, an election to select five to serve on the Council was held June 30. The Council elected were: Edward L. Bonneau, Robert C. Graham, Jr., Glenn E. Massnick, George Whittaker, and Judge Julien Southerland. Judge Southerland was chosen as mayor. Willard Webb, who had been acting manager since the first organization, was appointed as Village Manager. Mary Wetterer was named Village Clerk and Herold Dickey was appointed Chief of Police.%0a%3c %0a%3c In 1947, the Church by the Sea was built. In 1948, the Beach Club was built. Its restaurant was operated by Howard Johnson's. In 1949, a new bridge was started over Baker Haulover.%0a%3c %0a%3c In 1956, the current Village Hall was built. In 1956, the Hotel Americana was built. It became the Sheraton Hotel in 1980. It was imploded on November 18, 2007 to build a set of condos and a luxury aparthotel as the St. Regis. In 1959, Bal Harbour's beach was renovated due to severe erosion.%0a%3c %0a%3c In 1965, the Bal Harbour Shops was built by the Whitman family. Stanley Whitman was one of the incorporators who lived with his family in the barrack apartments. In 1971, Bal Harbour's beach started a major renourishment project. In 1984, the residents of an exclusive neighborhood in Bal Harbour were successfully sued to remove the clause preventing Jews and blacks from owning property there.%0a%3c %0a%3c In 2008, The new Regent Bal Harbour opened, becoming the northern gateway to the Village. In 2012, The last oceanfront undeveloped Beach Club site was sold for $220 million in order to make way to the ultra luxury Oceana at Bal Harbour. In 2014, The Ritz-Carlton Bal Harbour, Miami opens at the former Regent Bal Harbour and ONE Bal Harbour Resort & Spa.%0a%3c %0a%3c In 2015, it was reported in the press that "the Bal Harbour Police and the Glades County Sheriff set up a giant money laundering scheme, but it all fell apart when federal investigators and the Miami Herald found strange things going on."%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!%25center%25''Humboldt''%0a> %0a> The Humboldt neighborhood in Portland can probably best be described as young, urban and hip. The streets are busied with bike traffic, foot-traffic and buses cruising by every few minutes. This area is a hot-spot for the 20-30ish Portland crowd looking for easy access to downtown and the ever-cool Boise neighborhood which is known to most as "Mississippi" due to its most popular and populated street, Historic Mississippi Ave. Mississippi is a destination for many out of area out of neighborhood visitors and Humboldt enjoys the spill over traffic coming up to its famous coffee shop, The Albina Press. Atlas Tattoo, located a few doors down from the Albina Press, is Portland renowned for incredible ink work. The Red Fox is the very popular local watering hole.%0a> %0a> Locals here probably spend a lot of their time on Mississippi Avenue since they can walk there in less than five minutes or bike in a flash.  Mississippi has just about everything the average Humboldter could need: nearly a dozen great restaurants, great coffee shops, several watering holes (bars) and a lot of retail and boutique shops.  A few standouts on the street are Mississippi Street's Crow Bar, Amnesia Brewing, Gravy, Equinox, Por Que No?!, The Fresh Pot, Lorenzo's, Pistils Nursery and Miss Delta.  It should also be noted that Humboldt and Mississippi are home to mostly independent businesses.  You won't find a Starbucks here and locals will see to it that you don't.%0a> %0a> Portland Community College is a major presence in the Humboldt area and many residents are also students or faculty. Nearby Williams Avenue offers even more independent retail and boutiques in addition to standouts Lompoc's 5Q (Fifth Quarter) and Pix Patisserie and Ristretto Roasters.  Additionally, Killingsworth Street has several really great local businesses to choose from such as Saraveza (a beer bottle shop), The Red E Cafe, E'njoni Ethiopian Cafe and CoffeeHouse-Five. Down the road on Interstate is a New Seasons Market which is a local area shopping staple and employer.   Artsy, earthy, and most definitely hip although the area hipsters would shy away from this claim. Bikes and scooters are more widely accepted than cars. The neighborhood prizes diversity, independence and entrepreneurialism. Locals know each other and support their local businesses.  A mix of renters and owners, singletons and families.  Everyone seems to be busy doing something interesting.  Humboldt homes are either modest, awesome or funky and are just as varied from Old Victorians, Bungalows, Old Foursquare, ranch, apartments, fresh new condos and more. Creative paint schemes and landscaping will shout out to you from pockets all around the neighborhood. It's not uncommon to see "lawn gardens" peppered with edibles such as strawberries, blueberries and herbs in lieu of boring old grass.%0a> %0a> Humboldt experienced the same boom that Mississippi and surrounding areas did and as a result, a huge mass of people moved in and prices increased dramatically.  That said, one can still find affordable homes in the Humboldt area. If you are looking to purchase a home in this area, make sure to be on your toes and ready to make a quick offer as Humboldt homes are highly coveted and will not stay on the market long. All in all, Humboldt is a great place for those who want the comfy feel of an older home, a sense of community and easy access to other popular neighborhoods and downtown Portland.%0a> %0a173,174c174,175%0a%3c !!!!'''Average Resources''' ••• to ••••%0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a> %0a176a178,319%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> %0a> %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25''Irvington''%0a> %0a> Irvington is in a fantastic location for both commuting, as well as getting to many other great Portland neighborhoods. Major freeway ramps located near Irvington include I-84 and I-5. Portland’s Tri Met runs bus schedules, and the MAX light rail train is only blocks away from Irvington’s Southernmost boundary, at Lloyd Center Mall. Drive West over the Broadway bridge to get downtown or to the Pearl District in mere minutes, or head Northeast to Alberta or Beaumont-Wilshire, Northwest to the Boise/Eliot and Historic Mississippi Avenue neighborhoods, or Southeast to get to the Belmont and Hawthorne neighborhoods.  Portland’s Irvington neighborhood cannot be easily characterized. On its southern border is a sizeable strip of restaurants, bars, coffee houses, personal service establishments, and shop after shop. In this section of Irvington is the array between bars with video lottery and shops with expensive lingerie. Irvington’s northern border is primarily residential, but where commercialism pops through tends to be high-end. And on its east and west sit two large parks.%0a> %0a> In between? Well, this is the kind of neighborhood for which people enter the American dream. The houses, each unique and almost all attractive with their ancient trees and flowing green lawns, seem the picture of Americana that we agreed to when we entered the game. The children playing seem palpably blessed to have this as their foundation. And driving through you can almost hear the promise of a simpler country and a simpler time if we just hold onto neighborhoods like it.  Several grand dame old homes are located here, and many are on the National Register of Historic Places. Back when they were constructed, Irvington homes were considered upper middle class. The sense of Irvington history can be found in more than just the homes. The exclusive Irvington Club for tennis was founded in 1898. And, if you pay attention while strolling the streets, you’ll notice many sidewalks imprinted with the original craftsman’s name and date (”E. Wiles 1908”) and you’ll even find an occasional metal ring still attached to the curb, from back in the days when everyone had horses to tie up instead of automobiles to park.%0a> %0a> Like any neighborhood that has been around since the turn of the last century, Irvington has suffered from periodic slumps over the years. Some houses fell into disrepair, and here and there a house was demolished and replaced with a “modern” mid-century apartment or commercial building. But overall, if you enjoy historic charm and unique homes with fine character and craftsmanship, you’ll love Irvington.  %0a> %0a> Irvington is a classic American neighborhood, with beautiful older homes, manicured lawns, enormous mature trees, and quiet streets with sidewalks made for evening strolls. Live in Irvington if you appreciate the joys of owning an older home, (or enjoy restoration projects), and appreciate the classic appeal of an old established neighborhood. There are also plenty of rentals in the area. This is a also great location if living in a well-known, prestigious Portland neighborhood is important to you. Other benefits of Irvington include the convenience of being near shopping, walking to the coffee shop in the morning, and becoming a part of the community.%0a> %0a> Northeast Knott Street runs through the heart of Irvington and is lined with some of Irvington’s most beautiful homes.

Once predominantly African-American, the neighborhood has rapidly gentrified since the 1990s and attracted more young, mostly white residents. It was previously an area of high crime rates related to gang activity, poverty, and the crack epidemic of the 1980–1990s. With its proximity to the Alberta Commercial Corridor, King is now seen as one of the more popular Portland neighborhoods with housing prices remaining above Portland average.%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a> *%25werewolf%25[[Players.TobiasCastle|Tobias Castle]]%0a> *%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Locations'''%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> %0a> %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25''Sabin''%0a> %0a> Sabin is very conveniently located in NE Portland, just North of Irving Park and the Irvington neighborhood, West of Alameda neighborhood, along Fremont St. East of MLK.  Just North of the neighborhood, you'll find Concordia and the popular Alberta Arts District along Alberta Street. The convenient close-in location makes it an easy commute to downtown, and close to freeways for access to other areas of Portland.  There is a nice community feel to this older established neighborhood.  Neighbors enjoy walking to the park, enjoying the community garden on 11th Avenue, or walking along Fremont Street where there is a row of Portland coffee shops, restaurants, a neighborhood bar, and more.  Right around the corner within walking distance along 15th Avenue you'll find Wild Oats Market, a natural grocery store featuring many organic and healthy products.  Also in the shopping center is a video rental store, and Papa Murphy's Pizza.  Sabin features many charming older East Portland style homes, including Craftsman bungalows, and Old Portland foursquare.%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a> *%0a> *%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Locations'''%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> %0a> %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25''Sullivan’s Gulch''%0a> %0a> Sullivan's Gulch is located in Northeast Portland. It is bordered by the Lloyd, Kerns, Hollywood, Grant Park, Laurelhurst, and Irvington neighborhoods. Sullivan's Gulch is conveniently located on bus lines, and within a short distance to the MAX light rail station at Lloyd Center.  Sullivan's Gulch is a mixed urban and residential area that is located within walking distance to dining, shopping, and other entertainment. This well-established community has a mix of older East Portland homes, usually mid-sized to larger family homes located on streets with mature trees. There are also some lovely vintage apartments, and plexes for rent, as well as some newly developed condominiums for a more urban lifestyle.  Sullivan's Gulch is located near Lloyd Center Mall, and also offers great shopping along Broadway and Wiedler. Catch a movie at the local Regal Theaters Cineplex. Or, try one of the many restaurants in the area. Sullivan's Gulch is also home to the popular Fred Meyer store.%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a> [[Players.TheTriad|The Triad - Feng Family]]%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' ••••%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Locations'''%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> %0a> %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25%25werewolf%25''Sunderland''%25%25%0a> %0a> Sunderland is located in North Portland near the Portland International Airport. With the exception of two golf courses, Broadmoor Golf Course and the Columbia Edgewater Golf Club, both nice courses, there is little to do here. Most people agree with this, which is why it probably ranks as Portland’s smallest community at just over 500 people. %0a> %0a> Sunderland is known for being the location of Dignity Village, an encampment of approximately 60 homeless people.

Woodlawn neighborhood is the oldest settled area in the old Albina area -- now referred to as the Woodlawn Historic District. Initially settled in the 1860's as a rural farming village, it was the only independent town that existed outside the city of Albina (now Portland). Woodlawn's character changed dramatically in 1888 when the railroad running from Portland to Vancouver located a train station in the center of the village. This connection to a larger market stimulated commercial and residential development. The commercial uses centered around the train station with homes development surrounding the city center. The train depot was located at the intersection of today's Durham and Dekum avenues and the station's waiting room was built in the middle of a triangular park which is still present today. %0a> %0a> Woodlawn is a commonly overlooked neighborhood as it seems somewhat tucked away. Bordering industrial north and northeast Portland, Woodlawn really is a little gem of a neighborhood which is being slowly but surely built into a wonderful family oriented neighborhood. New businesses have popped up in the last few years such as: Buffalo Gardens, Woodlawn Coffee and Pastry and Breakside Brewery are local hangouts and area favorites. Others like the Good Neighbor Pizzeria shop and The Firehouse, are well known staples having weathered the early dormant years. The Firehouse is a must-visit restaurant, well known for their excellent wood-fired pizzas and amazing locally sourced dishes served in a beautiful and unique dining setting.  Like the neighboring communities, Woodlawn homes are fantastic turn-of-the-last-century classics such as Bungalows, Cape Cods, a few Victorians and Four squares.  Tree-lined, crooked streets are very quiet and mostly well maintained.  %0a> %0a> Woodlawn School is connected to the Community Garden which is connected to Woodlawn Park -which is complete with a fun water feature and big basketball court- making for a huge neighborhood gathering area. Nearly all the businesses in Woodlawn are locally owned. %0a> %0a> Woodlawn boasts a wonderful view of Vancouver, Washington at night. There are over 14 buildings on the historic registry in our small area.  Cyclists have often been the very few "outsiders" to navigate Woodlawn as once one knows the diagonals, Woodlawn is an excellent cut-through when coming from Jantzen Beach or other northern destinations. One would gather that it's also a neighborhood that is home to cyclists, as "Share the Road" and "My other car is a bike" bumper stickers abound. Cyclist residents enjoy the calm streets and proximity to downtown (4 miles).%0a> %0a> In the 1920's, paved major roads, the improved automobile and a bridge between Vancouver and Portland gave residents more shopping options and businesses in Woodlawn were either swept aside for housing or converted to factories. Woodlawn is 15 minutes travel time by car to Washington, 10 minutes to the Portland International Airport, 15 minutes to downtown Portland and 15 minutes to excellent shopping malls in good traffic conditions. Woodlawn is well served by buses and freight trains glide by at the base of the bluff. Some residents move here because they love the sight and sound of trains. Many residents commute by bicycle to their jobs. The proximity to the airport has caused some issues due to plane noise.%0a> Atop the bluff, Woodlawn is mostly residential, with Queen Annes, Craftsman bungalows, and an influx of modern infill housing and condos. Some of those homes are occupied by families who have lived in Woodlawn for six generations. In the 40's and 50's many ranch and smaller homes were built throughout the neighborhood to house the working class residents and evacuees of the Vanport Flood. Many of the Vanport people had worked in the shipyards during WW2.%0a> %0a> Woodlawn is a very desirable neighborhood with the Woodlawn Park as a centerpiece. Art and culture are eagerly supported here, and overflow crowds attend the productions of Trek in the Park each summer. Woodlawn in the 21st century has fascinating businesses and unique landmarks. In recent years there’s been a revitalization of businesses along Dekum, as envisioned in the 1993 Woodlawn Plan. We have exquisite pastry and coffee houses, fabulous restaurants, a brewpub, and a public benefit pub, a movement studio and a massage studio, a resale shop, a bicycle repair shop, ceramic studios, plant nurseries and many other fascinating businesses. The newest addition to the commercial triangle is a LEED Platinum remodel of a historic building housing a company that makes high quality, locally sourced, organic foods for local businesses. Light and heavy industrial businesses flank the current train route, as do a variety of businesses that need space, such as plant nurseries. %0a> %0a> !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a> *[[Players.JeffersonShantiJones|%25mage%25Jefferson -Shanti- Jones]]%0a> *%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a> Crafts +3, Trait 2%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Locations'''%0a> *%25mage%25[[Temple of Inner Illumination]]%0a

Drive West over the Broadway bridge to get downtown or to the Pearl District in mere minutes, or head Northeast to Alberta or Beaumont-Wilshire, Northwest to the Boise/Eliot and Historic Mississippi Avenue neighborhoods, or Southeast to get to the Belmont and Hawthorne neighborhoods.  Portland’s Irvington neighborhood cannot be easily characterized. On its southern border is a sizeable strip of restaurants, bars, coffee houses, personal service establishments, and shop after shop. In this section of Irvington is the array between bars with video lottery and shops with expensive lingerie. Irvington’s northern border is primarily residential, but where commercialism pops through tends to be high-end. And on its east and west sit two large parks.%0a%3c %0a%3c In between? Well, this is the kind of neighborhood for which people enter the American dream. The houses, each unique and almost all attractive with their ancient trees and flowing green lawns, seem the picture of Americana that we agreed to when we entered the game. The children playing seem palpably blessed to have this as their foundation. And driving through you can almost hear the promise of a simpler country and a simpler time if we just hold onto neighborhoods like it.  Several grand dame old homes are located here, and many are on the National Register of Historic Places. Back when they were constructed, Irvington homes were considered upper middle class. The sense of Irvington history can be found in more than just the homes. The exclusive Irvington Club for tennis was founded in 1898. And, if you pay attention while strolling the streets, you’ll notice many sidewalks imprinted with the original craftsman’s name and date (”E. Wiles 1908”) and you’ll even find an occasional metal ring still attached to the curb, from back in the days when everyone had horses to tie up instead of automobiles to park.%0a%3c %0a%3c Like any neighborhood that has been around since the turn of the last century, Irvington has suffered from periodic slumps over the years. Some houses fell into disrepair, and here and there a house was demolished and replaced with a “modern” mid-century apartment or commercial building. But overall, if you enjoy historic charm and unique homes with fine character and craftsmanship, you’ll love Irvington.  %0a%3c %0a%3c Irvington is a classic American neighborhood, with beautiful older homes, manicured lawns, enormous mature trees, and quiet streets with sidewalks made for evening strolls. Live in Irvington if you appreciate the joys of owning an older home, (or enjoy restoration projects), and appreciate the classic appeal of an old established neighborhood. There are also plenty of rentals in the area. This is a also great location if living in a well-known, prestigious Portland neighborhood is important to you. Other benefits of Irvington include the convenience of being near shopping, walking to the coffee shop in the morning, and becoming a part of the community.%0a%3c %0a%3c Northeast Knott Street runs through the heart of Irvington and is lined with some of Irvington’s most beautiful homes. Each year during the Christmas season a group of owners open their homes to the public. They use horse-drawn carriages to tour.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Like many of the surrounding neighborhoods, King has historically had one of the highest proportions of non-white residents in the city. Census data taken 2010 show that the neighborhood was 60.1%25 white.%0a%3c %0a%3c King straddles Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard from Ainsworth Street to Fremont and is at one end of the Alberta Arts District, a commercial district where locally owned shops, galleries, and cafés have brought new life. Once predominantly African-American, the neighborhood has rapidly gentrified since the 1990s and attracted more young, mostly white residents. It was previously an area of high crime rates related to gang activity, poverty, and the crack epidemic of the 1980–1990s. With its proximity to the Alberta Commercial Corridor, King is now seen as one of the more popular Portland neighborhoods with housing prices remaining above Portland average.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Just North of the neighborhood, you'll find Concordia and the popular Alberta Arts District along Alberta Street. The convenient close-in location makes it an easy commute to downtown, and close to freeways for access to other areas of Portland.  There is a nice community feel to this older established neighborhood.  Neighbors enjoy walking to the park, enjoying the community garden on 11th Avenue, or walking along Fremont Street where there is a row of Portland coffee shops, restaurants, a neighborhood bar, and more.  Right around the corner within walking distance along 15th Avenue you'll find Wild Oats Market, a natural grocery store featuring many organic and healthy products.  Also in the shopping center is a video rental store, and Papa Murphy's Pizza.  Sabin features many charming older East Portland style homes, including Craftsman bungalows, and Old Portland foursquare.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

It is bordered by the Lloyd, Kerns, Hollywood, Grant Park, Laurelhurst, and Irvington neighborhoods. Sullivan's Gulch is conveniently located on bus lines, and within a short distance to the MAX light rail station at Lloyd Center.  Sullivan's Gulch is a mixed urban and residential area that is located within walking distance to dining, shopping, and other entertainment. This well-established community has a mix of older East Portland homes, usually mid-sized to larger family homes located on streets with mature trees. There are also some lovely vintage apartments, and plexes for rent, as well as some newly developed condominiums for a more urban lifestyle.  Sullivan's Gulch is located near Lloyd Center Mall, and also offers great shopping along Broadway and Wiedler. Catch a movie at the local Regal Theaters Cineplex. Or, try one of the many restaurants in the area. Sullivan's Gulch is also home to the popular Fred Meyer store.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

With the exception of two golf courses, Broadmoor Golf Course and the Columbia Edgewater Golf Club, both nice courses, there is little to do here. Most people agree with this, which is why it probably ranks as Portland’s smallest community at just over 500 people. %0a%3c %0a%3c Sunderland is known for being the location of Dignity Village, an encampment of approximately 60 homeless people. Columbia River Correctional Institute is also located here, so frankly, this is not an appealing or popular family friendly community. %0a%3c %0a%3c Not surprisingly, homes are affordable, and there are little choices for shopping or dining.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Woodlawn neighborhood is the oldest settled area in the old Albina area -- now referred to as the Woodlawn Historic District. Initially settled in the 1860's as a rural farming village, it was the only independent town that existed outside the city of Albina (now Portland). Woodlawn's character changed dramatically in 1888 when the railroad running from Portland to Vancouver located a train station in the center of the village. This connection to a larger market stimulated commercial and residential development. The commercial uses centered around the train station with homes development surrounding the city center. The train depot was located at the intersection of today's Durham and Dekum avenues and the station's waiting room was built in the middle of a triangular park which is still present today. %0a%3c %0a%3c Woodlawn is a commonly overlooked neighborhood as it seems somewhat tucked away. Bordering industrial north and northeast Portland, Woodlawn really is a little gem of a neighborhood which is being slowly but surely built into a wonderful family oriented neighborhood. New businesses have popped up in the last few years such as: Buffalo Gardens, Woodlawn Coffee and Pastry and Breakside Brewery are local hangouts and area favorites. Others like the Good Neighbor Pizzeria shop and The Firehouse, are well known staples having weathered the early dormant years. The Firehouse is a must-visit restaurant, well known for their excellent wood-fired pizzas and amazing locally sourced dishes served in a beautiful and unique dining setting.  Like the neighboring communities, Woodlawn homes are fantastic turn-of-the-last-century classics such as Bungalows, Cape Cods, a few Victorians and Four squares.  Tree-lined, crooked streets are very quiet and mostly well maintained.  %0a%3c %0a%3c Woodlawn School is connected to the Community Garden which is connected to Woodlawn Park -which is complete with a fun water feature and big basketball court- making for a huge neighborhood gathering area. Nearly all the businesses in Woodlawn are locally owned. %0a%3c %0a%3c Woodlawn boasts a wonderful view of Vancouver, Washington at night. There are over 14 buildings on the historic registry in our small area.  Cyclists have often been the very few "outsiders" to navigate Woodlawn as once one knows the diagonals, Woodlawn is an excellent cut-through when coming from Jantzen Beach or other northern destinations. One would gather that it's also a neighborhood that is home to cyclists, as "Share the Road" and "My other car is a bike" bumper stickers abound. Cyclist residents enjoy the calm streets and proximity to downtown (4 miles).%0a%3c %0a%3c In the 1920's, paved major roads, the improved automobile and a bridge between Vancouver and Portland gave residents more shopping options and businesses in Woodlawn were either swept aside for housing or converted to factories. Woodlawn is 15 minutes travel time by car to Washington, 10 minutes to the Portland International Airport, 15 minutes to downtown Portland and 15 minutes to excellent shopping malls in good traffic conditions. Woodlawn is well served by buses and freight trains glide by at the base of the bluff. Some residents move here because they love the sight and sound of trains. Many residents commute by bicycle to their jobs. The proximity to the airport has caused some issues due to plane noise.%0a%3c Atop the bluff, Woodlawn is mostly residential, with Queen Annes, Craftsman bungalows, and an influx of modern infill housing and condos. Some of those homes are occupied by families who have lived in Woodlawn for six generations. In the 40's and 50's many ranch and smaller homes were built throughout the neighborhood to house the working class residents and evacuees of the Vanport Flood. Many of the Vanport people had worked in the shipyards during WW2.%0a%3c %0a%3c Woodlawn is a very desirable neighborhood with the Woodlawn Park as a centerpiece. Art and culture are eagerly supported here, and overflow crowds attend the productions of Trek in the Park each summer. Woodlawn in the 21st century has fascinating businesses and unique landmarks. In recent years there’s been a revitalization of businesses along Dekum, as envisioned in the 1993 Woodlawn Plan. We have exquisite pastry and coffee houses, fabulous restaurants, a brewpub, and a public benefit pub, a movement studio and a massage studio, a resale shop, a bicycle repair shop, ceramic studios, plant nurseries and many other fascinating businesses. The newest addition to the commercial triangle is a LEED Platinum remodel of a historic building housing a company that makes high quality, locally sourced, organic foods for local businesses. Light and heavy industrial businesses flank the current train route, as do a variety of businesses that need space, such as plant nurseries. %0a---%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

During that time, Northeast Broadway, one of the district’s main thoroughfares, evolved naturally into a busy strip of restaurants and shops needed to support Portland’s growing eastside population. Although modern automobile travel and convenient MAX light rail service render many of the Northeast neighborhoods a quick 7-10 -minute jaunt to Portland’s downtown core, Northeast Portland seems charmingly detached from the bustle of the city center.%0a%3c %0a%3c The seeds of gentrification were planted during World War II, when African Americans from the South flowed into Portland to take jobs in the shipyards. Portland officials and community members, from real estate agents to bankers, pushed the black community into a small area called Lower Albina, near the present-day Rose Quarter, through redlining and other now-illegal practices. White Portlanders fled, and the city began a long pattern of disinvestment. Street and sidewalk repairs were neglected, and the city did little to develop businesses or enforce housing codes, said Dr. Karen Gibson, the PSU professor, who wrote a study in 2007 called Bleeding Albina: A History of Community Disinvestment, 1940-2000.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25'''Farmers Markets'''%0a%3c *'''Hollywood Farmers Market''' ''Northeast Hancock Street between 44th and 45th avenues.
