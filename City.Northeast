During that time, Northeast Broadway, one of the district’s main thoroughfares, evolved naturally into a busy strip of restaurants and shops needed to support Portland’s growing eastside population. Although modern automobile travel and convenient MAX light rail service render many of the Northeast neighborhoods a quick 7-10 -minute jaunt to Portland’s downtown core, Northeast Portland seems charmingly detached from the bustle of the city center.%0a%0aThe seeds of gentrification were planted during World War II, when African Americans from the South flowed into Portland to take jobs in the shipyards. Portland officials and community members, from real estate agents to bankers, pushed the black community into a small area called Lower Albina, near the present-day Rose Quarter, through redlining and other now-illegal practices. White Portlanders fled, and the city began a long pattern of disinvestment. Street and sidewalk repairs were neglected, and the city did little to develop businesses or enforce housing codes, said Dr. Karen Gibson, the PSU professor, who wrote a study in 2007 called Bleeding Albina: A History of Community Disinvestment, 1940-2000.%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Farmers Markets''%0a%0a*'''Hollywood Farmers Market''' ''Northeast Hancock Street between 44th and 45th avenues.

Homes that are located on Alameda ridge have a stunning view of Portland and the West hills. Alameda is a popular and prestigious community with a strong sense of neighborhood pride. Nearby (Beaumont-Wilshire) you will find coffee shops, a brewpub, and some nice residential and commercial areas to take a stroll. Alameda overlaps on one side with Irvington, also an older historical neighborhood with grand homes.  %0a%0aThis is a popular historical neighborhood with a comfortable family vibe.  It feels like a classic old neighborhood where people still know their neighbors and enjoy spending time at the park and school events, as well as hanging out at local establishments that have been in the neighborhood for decades.  Homes and lawns are well kept and show pride of ownership.  There are some wonderful views along Alameda Ridge, so this is also a popular neighborhood for walking tours.  There is a cute shopping and dining strip along Fremont heading into the Beaumont Wilshire neighborhood.  Coffee shops, boutiques, new establishments, and classic neighborhood restaurants that have been in the neighborhood for decades can be found along this strip.  %0a%0aJoining Portland's wide array of micro-breweries, Alameda has it's own brewpub. Try the Alameda Brewhouse.%0a%0aEnjoy a leisurely breakfast with the locals while reading the regional paper at the Alameda Cafe. Enjoy a delicious breakfast of homemade waffles, bacon and eggs, or some quiche.  Service is always friendly, and the warm cozy dining room is a wonderful place to spend some time on a cool rainy Portland day.  Homes in Alameda consist of older East Portland styles of Craftsman, Bungalow, and larger custom designs, as well as some more modest cottages, cape cods,  and ranch style homes.   This is a beautiful established neighborhood.  Some homes along Alameda Ridge offer nice views.%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Boise''%0a%0aBoise is a neighborhood in the North and Northeast sections of Portland that has and still is in the process of undergoing rapid development and gentrification. Boise is bordered by the following neighborhoods:  Humboldt to the north, King to the east, Eliot to the south, and Overlook to the west.%0a%0aIn the mid-1980s, maybe 5-6 businesses were operating on the five-block North Mississippi Avenue commercial strip between Fremont and Skidmore streets in the Boise neighborhood of North Portland.%0a%0aIt was a grim place! You name it, N. Mississippi had it: drugs, gangs, street crime, prostitution, abandoned houses — all the elements of urban decay. Today, there are more than 40 businesses on the street. Restaurants, coffee shops, a bike shop, a nursery, furniture makers, a home rebuilding center, and even a couple of recording studios.%0a%0aWhat happened? For one thing, in 1999 the city of Portland created the Mississippi Historic District Target Area to improve public safety, upgrade housing and attract businesses. The city brought an army of bureaucratic tools — including home improvement loans, technical assistance, and help — in dealing with the new designation. And the results are now starting to play out.%0a%0aHas the effort been a success? The city hasn’t succeeded entirely in making sure that gentrification doesn’t drive out existing residents. Yes, crime and drugs are down while optimism is up. But the area still deals with undercurrents of racial and class mistrust in one of Oregon’s poorest and most diverse neighborhoods. Changes are happening quickly. People walk to the shops by day; at night, live music can be found at the Mississippi Pizza Pub where crowds and the music spill out onto the sidewalk on warm evenings.%0a%0aThe new Interstate MAX line is three blocks away, and neighbors hope that the low rents will attract more young artists who will help continue the revival. More than 60 percent of the neighborhood today is under 35, census figures show.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''Mississippi Avenue Street Fair'''%0a%0aThe Mississippi Avenue Street Fair began in 2001 as a simple community-building event called the Boise-Eliot Multicultural Fair. The one-day event has since become Portland biggest street fair — attracting thousands and sprawling over five city blocks in the heart of the Historic Mississippi Avenue Business District.%0a%0aThe attractions have grown along with the fair and there are now multiple stages of entertainment with nearly 30 acts performing. Historic Mississippi Avenue Business Association (HMBA) and Boise Neighborhood Association (BNA) are the fair sponsors and it benefits the Boise-Eliot Elementary and Albina Youth Opportunity schools.%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a[[Players.ElkinsGang|The Elkins Gang]]%0a%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' ••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25mage%25''Concordia''%25%25%0a%0aConcordia is located in Northeast Portland. It is bordered by the Alameda, Sabin, Vernon, Woodlawn, Sunderland, Cully and Beaumont-Wilshire neighborhoods. Also check out the Alberta page for additional information on this neighborhood.  Edgy, fun, and creative, this area of Northeast Portland is seeing a resurgence  The homes come in many styles, and gentrification has hit this area with a mix of results.  Many homes have been revitalized and improved and this is a charming neighborhood with plenty of shopping, dining, and other amenities in the area.  *Support your local microbrews at the Concordia Ale House.%0a*For some great Italian food recently ranked by Portland Monthly magazine as one of the city's best, try Ciao Vito.%0a*Movies, events, food and more in a fun schoolhouse atmosphere! McMenamin's Kennedy School%0a*Of course for natural and organic local foods, there is nothing better than shopping at New Seasons Market.%0a*Milagros - A boutique for little Portland miracles and their mamas.%0a*Hail Mary (Mary Topagna) - Interesting artwork, furniture and gifts in a totally unique Portland shop.%0a*Extracto Coffeehouse - Another fine addition to Portland's coffee house scene, this neighborhood hangout is on Killingsworth across from Fat's.%0a%0aPortland bungalows, four square and Craftsman style homes can be found in this older Northeast neighborhood.  The area is being refurbished and many homes are being restored to original character and charm, with many artsy details.  The popular shopping and dining strip along Alberta Street makes this an easy neighborhood for convenience and livability.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''Alberta Street'''%0a%0aFunky galleries, independently owned boutiques, coffee shops, and restaurants and all located in one of Portland’s most culturally diverse neighborhoods, with many African-American and Latino-owned businesses. That’s Alberta Street. Alberta Street has many renovated retail storefronts that are mixed in with older businesses that have been there for years. Just a few years ago, you would be viewing many boarded up windows but today fresh paint and stylish logos are the norms.%0a%0aGo virtual shopping on Alberta Street by visiting all the business and service establishments on NE Alberta Street.%0a%0aFor more than a decade, Art on Alberta (AoA) has been a fixture in the community, providing education and outreach to a wide-ranging audience to foster understanding and appreciation of all forms of art. AoA’s mission is to promote the Alberta Art District’s distinct cultural identity through art and educational activities. They have sponsored a “Last Thursday” on Alberta Street since 1997. %0a%0aDuring Northeast Alberta Street’s Last Thursday, the art openings at spaces like the Guardino Gallery set the scene for a boisterous street fair that attracts independent artists and performers, from local bands to troupes of acrobats. Held year-round, the event is biggest from May through September, when the street is closed to traffic during the festivities. Most of the galleries are open until 9:30 p.m. on Last Thursday.%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%25mage%25[[mage.mage|Mage]]%25%25%0a*%25mage%25[[Players.Apotheosis|Apotheosis Cabal]]%25%25%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Eliot''%0a%0aAs you can see on the map, Eliot is full of popular dining establishments, as well as two coffee shops, music venues, parks, and the Matt Dishman community center with in-door swimming pool, and plenty of bus stops for public transportation.  This is a great close-in Portland community with access to everything you need.  The bike corridors along Williams and Vancouver contribute to easy bike commutes.%0a%0aEliot is a diverse community that is struggling to hold on to its history while fending off too much commercial urban redevelopment. Many of the residents of Eliot have lived here a long time, contributing to the sense of neighborhood pride and history of the area. There is a mix of residential and commercial property in Eliot, and the residential areas are generally attractive, quiet and livable, while the commercial areas are being actively redeveloped, bringing an influx of interest and energy that has both positive and negative aspects for the community. The residents are proud and protective of their special neighborhood and will actively fight any undesirable influx of commercial business that isn't viewed as a benefit to the neighborhood (witnessed recently when McDonald's tried unsuccessfully to move into the area). Given Eliot's excellent location to downtown, it will be interesting to see how the area grows and develops in the future. Some speculate the East side of the river holds even more potential than the former warehouse area now known as The Pearl District, because there is more affordable single-family residential housing available%0a%0aEliot is located close-in on the East side of the Willamette across the river from the Pearl District. Eliot is an urban neighborhood with cultural diversity. Home styles in this area consist of older Victorian cottages and other older East Portland styles that have historic charm and character you just can't find in the newer 'burbs. While some streets are still rough around the edges, there are many charming homes tucked into the Eliot neighborhood.  Here you will still find the early 1900s sidewalks imprinted with the names of the original craftsmen, with metal curb rings for tethering horses along the streets.  There are also recent infill houses and condos being built in the area, so you can actually find a newer home if that is your preference.  Eliot is very conveniently located for an easy commute, and it's popularity is growing as people rediscover North/Northeast Portland, and especially as the TriMet light rail expansion will bring the streetcar to the edge of Eliot.  Eliot is becoming something of a destination for good eats in Portland.  From Russell Street Barbeque, Queen of Sheba Ethiopian, and the new Afrique restaurant, there is plenty to choose from.%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Grant Park''%0a%0aGrant Park is located in Northeast Portland. It is bordered by the Sullivan's Gulch, Irvington, Alameda, Beaumont-Wilshire, Rose City Park and Hollywood neighborhoods.  Grant Park is conveniently located along Tri Met bus lines, and relatively close-in to Downtown Portland. The Grant Park community has a family-friendly feel, with quiet, residential streets lined with comfortable family homes.  The gem of the neighborhood is Grant Park, with large mature trees, and a nice playground, as well as a dog park area.  Grant Park adjoins Grant High School, and has lit tennis courts, a pool, a track, and lots of playground equipment for kids. Grant Park is conveniently located near coffee shops, restaurants, and shopping in popular commercial areas lining Broadway, and along Fremont St. in the Beaumont-Wilshire, Irvington and Alameda neighborhoods.  Also nearby in the Hollywood district, you will find additional shops, restaurants, and the popular neighborhood Trader Joe's market.%0a%0aBesides visiting the park, neighbors also enjoy walking through the hills behind 35th and Siskiyou for beautiful views, and exploring the hillside stairwells that take you to the top of the stunning Alameda Ridge.  Definitely drive under the trees on Knott Street between 33rd and 42nd Avenues in spring time to enjoy the show of cherry blossoms, and in the fall to enjoy the maple leaves!  Also, this is an excellent neighborhood for summertime yard sales.  Grant Park offers a wide range of home styles, from classic Old Portland style homes to Craftsman Cottages, Cape Codes, Bungalows, Colonials and more.  Along the tree-lined residential streets, you'll find that homes are well cared for, and yards are nicely landscaped and well maintained.  %0a%0a*Grant Park neighbors enjoy the following nearby restaurants:%0a*Enjoy Gustav's for German American fare, where locals enjoy sitting at the bar and eating house-made pretzels and fondue...and of course, drinking from their enormous beer selection.%0a*After shopping at Trader Joes, stop in to recharge with some sushi.  Hama Sushi has friendly service, clean and cozy interior, and good prices.%0a*Northeast Portlander's know.. for some excellent Thai food, you'll want to try Tuk-Tuk Thai  on Fremont St., or Sweet Basil Thai on Broadway.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''Beverly Cleary Sculpture Garden for Children'''%0aThe Beverly Cleary Sculpture Garden for Children was dedicated in the park on October 13, 1995. Funded by donations from Cleary fans, the park was built by the Friends of Henry and Ramona. It includes life-sized renditions by local sculptor Lee Hunt of three Cleary characters: Ramona Quimby, Henry Huggins, and Ribsy (Henry's dog). The life-sized sculptures were created using vintage clothes on wax models to create a realistic feel. The sculpture of Ramona is dressed in raincoat and boots, with a joyous expression, and is positioned such that she splashes in the garden's fountain. Granite tiles placed around the sculptures are inscribed with quotes from Cleary's most famous books%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Humboldt''%0a%0aThe Humboldt neighborhood in Portland can probably best be described as young, urban and hip. The streets are busied with bike traffic, foot-traffic and buses cruising by every few minutes. This area is a hot-spot for the 20-30ish Portland crowd looking for easy access to downtown and the ever-cool Boise neighborhood which is known to most as "Mississippi" due to its most popular and populated street, Historic Mississippi Ave. Mississippi is a destination for many out of area out of neighborhood visitors and Humboldt enjoys the spill over traffic coming up to its famous coffee shop, The Albina Press. Atlas Tattoo, located a few doors down from the Albina Press, is Portland renowned for incredible ink work. The Red Fox is the very popular local watering hole.%0a%0aLocals here probably spend a lot of their time on Mississippi Avenue since they can walk there in less than five minutes or bike in a flash.  Mississippi has just about everything the average Humboldter could need: nearly a dozen great restaurants, great coffee shops, several watering holes (bars) and a lot of retail and boutique shops.  A few standouts on the street are Mississippi Street's Crow Bar, Amnesia Brewing, Gravy, Equinox, Por Que No?!, The Fresh Pot, Lorenzo's, Pistils Nursery and Miss Delta.  It should also be noted that Humboldt and Mississippi are home to mostly independent businesses.  You won't find a Starbucks here and locals will see to it that you don't.%0a%0aPortland Community College is a major presence in the Humboldt area and many residents are also students or faculty. Nearby Williams Avenue offers even more independent retail and boutiques in addition to standouts Lompoc's 5Q (Fifth Quarter) and Pix Patisserie and Ristretto Roasters.  Additionally, Killingsworth Street has several really great local businesses to choose from such as Saraveza (a beer bottle shop), The Red E Cafe, E'njoni Ethiopian Cafe and CoffeeHouse-Five. Down the road on Interstate is a New Seasons Market which is a local area shopping staple and employer.   Artsy, earthy, and most definitely hip although the area hipsters would shy away from this claim. Bikes and scooters are more widely accepted than cars. The neighborhood prizes diversity, independence and entrepreneurialism. Locals know each other and support their local businesses.  A mix of renters and owners, singletons and families.  Everyone seems to be busy doing something interesting.  Humboldt homes are either modest, awesome or funky and are just as varied from Old Victorians, Bungalows, Old Foursquare, ranch, apartments, fresh new condos and more. Creative paint schemes and landscaping will shout out to you from pockets all around the neighborhood. It's not uncommon to see "lawn gardens" peppered with edibles such as strawberries, blueberries and herbs in lieu of boring old grass.%0a%0aHumboldt experienced the same boom that Mississippi and surrounding areas did and as a result, a huge mass of people moved in and prices increased dramatically.  That said, one can still find affordable homes in the Humboldt area. If you are looking to purchase a home in this area, make sure to be on your toes and ready to make a quick offer as Humboldt homes are highly coveted and will not stay on the market long. All in all, Humboldt is a great place for those who want the comfy feel of an older home, a sense of community and easy access to other popular neighborhoods and downtown Portland.%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Irvington''%0a%0aIrvington is in a fantastic location for both commuting, as well as getting to many other great Portland neighborhoods. Major freeway ramps located near Irvington include I-84 and I-5. Portland’s Tri Met runs bus schedules, and the MAX light rail train is only blocks away from Irvington’s Southernmost boundary, at Lloyd Center Mall. Drive West over the Broadway bridge to get downtown or to the Pearl District in mere minutes, or head Northeast to Alberta or Beaumont-Wilshire, Northwest to the Boise/Eliot and Historic Mississippi Avenue neighborhoods, or Southeast to get to the Belmont and Hawthorne neighborhoods.  Portland’s Irvington neighborhood cannot be easily characterized. On its southern border is a sizeable strip of restaurants, bars, coffee houses, personal service establishments, and shop after shop. In this section of Irvington is the array between bars with video lottery and shops with expensive lingerie. Irvington’s northern border is primarily residential, but where commercialism pops through tends to be high-end. And on its east and west sit two large parks.%0a%0aIn between? Well, this is the kind of neighborhood for which people enter the American dream. The houses, each unique and almost all attractive with their ancient trees and flowing green lawns, seem the picture of Americana that we agreed to when we entered the game. The children playing seem palpably blessed to have this as their foundation. And driving through you can almost hear the promise of a simpler country and a simpler time if we just hold onto neighborhoods like it.  Several grand dame old homes are located here, and many are on the National Register of Historic Places. Back when they were constructed, Irvington homes were considered upper middle class. The sense of Irvington history can be found in more than just the homes. The exclusive Irvington Club for tennis was founded in 1898. And, if you pay attention while strolling the streets, you’ll notice many sidewalks imprinted with the original craftsman’s name and date (”E. Wiles 1908”) and you’ll even find an occasional metal ring still attached to the curb, from back in the days when everyone had horses to tie up instead of automobiles to park.%0a%0aLike any neighborhood that has been around since the turn of the last century, Irvington has suffered from periodic slumps over the years. Some houses fell into disrepair, and here and there a house was demolished and replaced with a “modern” mid-century apartment or commercial building. But overall, if you enjoy historic charm and unique homes with fine character and craftsmanship, you’ll love Irvington.  %0a%0aIrvington is a classic American neighborhood, with beautiful older homes, manicured lawns, enormous mature trees, and quiet streets with sidewalks made for evening strolls. Live in Irvington if you appreciate the joys of owning an older home, (or enjoy restoration projects), and appreciate the classic appeal of an old established neighborhood. There are also plenty of rentals in the area. This is a also great location if living in a well-known, prestigious Portland neighborhood is important to you. Other benefits of Irvington include the convenience of being near shopping, walking to the coffee shop in the morning, and becoming a part of the community.%0a%0aNortheast Knott Street runs through the heart of Irvington and is lined with some of Irvington’s most beautiful homes. Each year during the Christmas season a group of owners open their homes to the public. They use horse-drawn carriages to tour.%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''King''%0a%0aKing is a neighborhood in the northeast section of Portland, Oregon, United States. Like many of the surrounding neighborhoods, King has historically had one of the highest proportions of non-white residents in the city. Census data taken 2010 show that the neighborhood was 60.1%25 white.%0a%0aKing straddles Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard from Ainsworth Street to Fremont and is at one end of the Alberta Arts District, a commercial district where locally owned shops, galleries, and cafés have brought new life. Once predominantly African-American, the neighborhood has rapidly gentrified since the 1990s and attracted more young, mostly white residents. It was previously an area of high crime rates related to gang activity, poverty, and the crack epidemic of the 1980–1990s. With its proximity to the Alberta Commercial Corridor, King is now seen as one of the more popular Portland neighborhoods with housing prices remaining above Portland average.%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Sabin''%0a%0aSabin is very conveniently located in NE Portland, just North of Irving Park and the Irvington neighborhood, West of Alameda neighborhood, along Fremont St. East of MLK.  Just North of the neighborhood, you'll find Concordia and the popular Alberta Arts District along Alberta Street. The convenient close-in location makes it an easy commute to downtown, and close to freeways for access to other areas of Portland.  There is a nice community feel to this older established neighborhood.  Neighbors enjoy walking to the park, enjoying the community garden on 11th Avenue, or walking along Fremont Street where there is a row of Portland coffee shops, restaurants, a neighborhood bar, and more.  Right around the corner within walking distance along 15th Avenue you'll find Wild Oats Market, a natural grocery store featuring many organic and healthy products.  Also in the shopping center is a video rental store, and Papa Murphy's Pizza.

Sullivan's Gulch is a mixed urban and residential area that is located within walking distance to dining, shopping, and other entertainment. This well-established community has a mix of older East Portland homes, usually mid-sized to larger family homes located on streets with mature trees. There are also some lovely vintage apartments, and plexes for rent, as well as some newly developed condominiums for a more urban lifestyle.  Sullivan's Gulch is located near Lloyd Center Mall, and also offers great shopping along Broadway and Wiedler. Catch a movie at the local Regal Theaters Cineplex.

Woodlawn neighborhood is the oldest settled area in the old Albina area -- now referred to as the Woodlawn Historic District. Initially settled in the 1860's as a rural farming village, it was the only independent town that existed outside the city of Albina (now Portland). Woodlawn's character changed dramatically in 1888 when the railroad running from Portland to Vancouver located a train station in the center of the village. This connection to a larger market stimulated commercial and residential development. The commercial uses centered around the train station with homes development surrounding the city center. The train depot was located at the intersection of today's Durham and Dekum avenues and the station's waiting room was built in the middle of a triangular park which is still present today. %0a%0aWoodlawn is a commonly overlooked neighborhood as it seems somewhat tucked away. Bordering industrial north and northeast Portland, Woodlawn really is a little gem of a neighborhood which is being slowly but surely built into a wonderful family oriented neighborhood. New businesses have popped up in the last few years such as: Buffalo Gardens, Woodlawn Coffee and Pastry and Breakside Brewery are local hangouts and area favorites. Others like the Good Neighbor Pizzeria shop and The Firehouse, are well known staples having weathered the early dormant years. The Firehouse is a must-visit restaurant, well known for their excellent wood-fired pizzas and amazing locally sourced dishes served in a beautiful and unique dining setting.  Like the neighboring communities, Woodlawn homes are fantastic turn-of-the-last-century classics such as Bungalows, Cape Cods, a few Victorians and Four squares.  Tree-lined, crooked streets are very quiet and mostly well maintained.  %0a%0aWoodlawn School is connected to the Community Garden which is connected to Woodlawn Park -which is complete with a fun water feature and big basketball court- making for a huge neighborhood gathering area. Nearly all the businesses in Woodlawn are locally owned. %0a%0aWoodlawn boasts a wonderful view of Vancouver, Washington at night. There are over 14 buildings on the historic registry in our small area.  Cyclists have often been the very few "outsiders" to navigate Woodlawn as once one knows the diagonals, Woodlawn is an excellent cut-through when coming from Jantzen Beach or other northern destinations. One would gather that it's also a neighborhood that is home to cyclists, as "Share the Road" and "My other car is a bike" bumper stickers abound. Cyclist residents enjoy the calm streets and proximity to downtown (4 miles).%0a%0aIn the 1920's, paved major roads, the improved automobile and a bridge between Vancouver and Portland gave residents more shopping options and businesses in Woodlawn were either swept aside for housing or converted to factories. Woodlawn is 15 minutes travel time by car to Washington, 10 minutes to the Portland International Airport, 15 minutes to downtown Portland and 15 minutes to excellent shopping malls in good traffic conditions. Woodlawn is well served by buses and freight trains glide by at the base of the bluff. Some residents move here because they love the sight and sound of trains. Many residents commute by bicycle to their jobs. The proximity to the airport has caused some issues due to plane noise.%0aAtop the bluff, Woodlawn is mostly residential, with Queen Annes, Craftsman bungalows, and an influx of modern infill housing and condos. Some of those homes are occupied by families who have lived in Woodlawn for six generations. In the 40's and 50's many ranch and smaller homes were built throughout the neighborhood to house the working class residents and evacuees of the Vanport Flood. Many of the Vanport people had worked in the shipyards during WW2.%0a%0aWoodlawn is a very desirable neighborhood with the Woodlawn Park as a centerpiece. Art and culture are eagerly supported here, and overflow crowds attend the productions of Trek in the Park each summer. Woodlawn in the 21st century has fascinating businesses and unique landmarks. In recent years there’s been a revitalization of businesses along Dekum, as envisioned in the 1993 Woodlawn Plan. We have exquisite pastry and coffee houses, fabulous restaurants, a brewpub, and a public benefit pub, a movement studio and a massage studio, a resale shop, a bicycle repair shop, ceramic studios, plant nurseries and many other fascinating businesses. The newest addition to the commercial triangle is a LEED Platinum remodel of a historic building housing a company that makes high quality, locally sourced, organic foods for local businesses. Light and heavy industrial businesses flank the current train route, as do a variety of businesses that need space, such as plant nurseries. %0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a(:include GameRef.Directoryhelp:)

Humboldt homes are either modest, awesome or funky and are just as varied from Old Victorians, Bungalows, Old Foursquare, ranch, apartments, fresh new condos and more. Creative paint schemes and landscaping will shout out to you from pockets all around the neighborhood. It's not uncommon to see "lawn gardens" peppered with edibles such as strawberries, blueberries and herbs in lieu of boring old grass.%0a%3c %0a%3c Humboldt experienced the same boom that Mississippi and surrounding areas did and as a result, a huge mass of people moved in and prices increased dramatically.  That said, one can still find affordable homes in the Humboldt area. If you are looking to purchase a home in this area, make sure to be on your toes and ready to make a quick offer as Humboldt homes are highly coveted and will not stay on the market long. All in all, Humboldt is a great place for those who want the comfy feel of an older home, a sense of community and easy access to other popular neighborhoods and downtown Portland.%0a---%0a> Portland Community College is a major presence in the Humboldt area and many residents are also students or faculty. Nearby Williams Avenue offers even more independent retail and boutiques in addition to standouts Lompoc's 5Q (Fifth Quarter) and Pix Patisserie and Ristretto Roasters.  Additionally, Killingsworth Street has several really great local businesses to choose from such as Saraveza (a beer bottle shop), The Red E Cafe, E'njoni Ethiopian Cafe and CoffeeHouse-Five. Down the road on Interstate is a New Seasons Market which is a local area shopping staple and employer. %0a

Boise is bordered by the following neighborhoods:  Humboldt to the north, King to the east, Eliot to the south, and Overlook to the west.%0a%3c %0a%3c In the mid-1980s, maybe 5-6 businesses were operating on the five-block North Mississippi Avenue commercial strip between Fremont and Skidmore streets in the Boise neighborhood of North Portland.%0a%3c %0a%3c It was a grim place! You name it, N. Mississippi had it: drugs, gangs, street crime, prostitution, abandoned houses — all the elements of urban decay. Today, there are more than 40 businesses on the street. Restaurants, coffee shops, a bike shop, a nursery, furniture makers, a home rebuilding center, and even a couple of recording studios.%0a%3c %0a%3c What happened? For one thing, in 1999 the city of Portland created the Mississippi Historic District Target Area to improve public safety, upgrade housing and attract businesses. The city brought an army of bureaucratic tools — including home improvement loans, technical assistance, and help — in dealing with the new designation. And the results are now starting to play out.%0a%3c %0a%3c Has the effort been a success? The city hasn’t succeeded entirely in making sure that gentrification doesn’t drive out existing residents. Yes, crime and drugs are down while optimism is up. But the area still deals with undercurrents of racial and class mistrust in one of Oregon’s poorest and most diverse neighborhoods. Changes are happening quickly. People walk to the shops by day; at night, live music can be found at the Mississippi Pizza Pub where crowds and the music spill out onto the sidewalk on warm evenings.%0a%3c %0a%3c The new Interstate MAX line is three blocks away, and neighbors hope that the low rents will attract more young artists who will help continue the revival. More than 60 percent of the neighborhood today is under 35, census figures show.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''Mississippi Avenue Street Fair'''%0a%3c %0a%3c The Mississippi Avenue Street Fair began in 2001 as a simple community-building event called the Boise-Eliot Multicultural Fair. The one-day event has since become Portland biggest street fair — attracting thousands and sprawling over five city blocks in the heart of the Historic Mississippi Avenue Business District.%0a%3c %0a%3c The attractions have grown along with the fair and there are now multiple stages of entertainment with nearly 30 acts performing. Historic Mississippi Avenue Business Association (HMBA) and Boise Neighborhood Association (BNA) are the fair sponsors and it benefits the Boise-Eliot Elementary and Albina Youth Opportunity schools.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Neighborhoods bordering Concordia are Woodlawn, Vernon, and Sabin on the west, Sunderland on the north, Cully on the east, and Alameda and Beaumont-Wilshire on the south. Most of the Alberta Street Arts District is in the Concordia neighborhood.%0a%3c %0a%3c If you like diversity, funky, and art, you’ll love Concordia. Park your car and start walking along NE Alberta Street from NE 33rd Avenue heading west. Stop and browse at some of the dozen or so art galleries along the way. Note the complete absence of national chains and fast food outlets. When you get thirsty and hungry, stop off for lunch at one of the eating establishments along the street.%0a%3c %0a%3c Now that you have seen Concordia, you will realize that this was a neighborhood in transition, and it has turned the corner. You can find lots of historic homes (especially on the east side of the neighborhood boundary) that need some TLC.%0a%3c %0a%3c New Seasons Market at Concordia has been recognized as a national business model for New Seasons approach to opening a business with the community’s best interest in mind. When Portland’s Concordia neighborhood voiced their need for a grocery store in 2000, New Seasons jumped at the chance, while other retailers second-guessed the store’s location. New Seasons Market established relationships across cross-cultural barriers, attended neighborhood meetings and responded to the neighborhood’s priorities. It’s a store that’s clean, friendly, and a pleasure to shop at. Try their Rocky natural chickens or the Oregon Beef. But the best is their Pacific Coast fish, always fresh and wild.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''Alberta Street'''%0a%3c %0a%3c Funky galleries, independently owned boutiques, coffee shops, and restaurants and all located in one of Portland’s most culturally diverse neighborhoods, with many African-American and Latino-owned businesses. That’s Alberta Street. Alberta Street has many renovated retail storefronts that are mixed in with older businesses that have been there for years. Just a few years ago, you would be viewing many boarded up windows but today fresh paint and stylish logos are the norms.%0a%3c %0a%3c Go virtual shopping on Alberta Street by visiting all the business and service establishments on NE Alberta Street.%0a%3c %0a%3c For more than a decade, Art on Alberta (AoA) has been a fixture in the community, providing education and outreach to a wide-ranging audience to foster understanding and appreciation of all forms of art. AoA’s mission is to promote the Alberta Art District’s distinct cultural identity through art and educational activities. They have sponsored a “Last Thursday” on Alberta Street since 1997. %0a%3c %0a%3c During Northeast Alberta Street’s Last Thursday, the art openings at spaces like the Guardino Gallery set the scene for a boisterous street fair that attracts independent artists and performers, from local bands to troupes of acrobats. Held year-round, the event is biggest from May through September, when the street is closed to traffic during the festivities. Most of the galleries are open until 9:30 p.m. on Last Thursday.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

This is a great close-in Portland community with access to everything you need.  The bike corridors along Williams and Vancouver contribute to easy bike commutes.%0a%3c %0a%3c Eliot is a diverse community that is struggling to hold on to its history while fending off too much commercial urban redevelopment. Many of the residents of Eliot have lived here a long time, contributing to the sense of neighborhood pride and history of the area. There is a mix of residential and commercial property in Eliot, and the residential areas are generally attractive, quiet and livable, while the commercial areas are being actively redeveloped, bringing an influx of interest and energy that has both positive and negative aspects for the community. The residents are proud and protective of their special neighborhood and will actively fight any undesirable influx of commercial business that isn't viewed as a benefit to the neighborhood (witnessed recently when McDonald's tried unsuccessfully to move into the area). Given Eliot's excellent location to downtown, it will be interesting to see how the area grows and develops in the future. Some speculate the East side of the river holds even more potential than the former warehouse area now known as The Pearl District, because there is more affordable single-family residential housing available%0a%3c %0a%3c Eliot is located close-in on the East side of the Willamette across the river from the Pearl District. Eliot is an urban neighborhood with cultural diversity. Home styles in this area consist of older Victorian cottages and other older East Portland styles that have historic charm and character you just can't find in the newer 'burbs. While some streets are still rough around the edges, there are many charming homes tucked into the Eliot neighborhood.  Here you will still find the early 1900s sidewalks imprinted with the names of the original craftsmen, with metal curb rings for tethering horses along the streets.  There are also recent infill houses and condos being built in the area, so you can actually find a newer home if that is your preference.  Eliot is very conveniently located for an easy commute, and it's popularity is growing as people rediscover North/Northeast Portland, and especially as the TriMet light rail expansion will bring the streetcar to the edge of Eliot.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Grant Park is bordered by the neighborhoods of Alameda and Beaumont-Wilshire to the north, Rose City Park to the east, Hollywood District, Laurelhurst, and Sullivan’s Gulch to the south, and Irvington to the west. Grant Park is the setting for Beverly Cleary‘s Klickitat Street series of books.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Grant Park is a family-friendly feel, with quiet, residential streets that are lined with comfortable family homes. Grant Park with large mature trees, sports facilities, playground, and off-leash dog area, is the social center of the neighborhood.%0a%3c %0a%3c Grant Park abuts (and overlaps) the following neighborhoods: Irvington on the west, Sullivan’s Gulch on the east, Alameda on the north, Hollywood on the east, Laurelhurst on the southeast, Beaumont-Wilshire on the northeast, and Rose City on the east.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''Beverly Cleary Sculpture Garden for Children'''%0a%3c The Beverly Cleary Sculpture Garden for Children was dedicated in the park on October 13, 1995. Funded by donations from Cleary fans, the park was built by the Friends of Henry and Ramona. It includes life-sized renditions by local sculptor Lee Hunt of three Cleary characters: Ramona Quimby, Henry Huggins, and Ribsy (Henry's dog). The life-sized sculptures were created using vintage clothes on wax models to create a realistic feel. The sculpture of Ramona is dressed in raincoat and boots, with a joyous expression, and is positioned such that she splashes in the garden's fountain. Granite tiles placed around the sculptures are inscribed with quotes from Cleary's most famous books%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Bikes and scooters are more widely accepted than cars. The neighborhood prizes diversity, independence and entrepreneurialism. Locals know each other and support their local businesses.  A mix of renters and owners, singletons and families.  Everyone seems to be busy doing something interesting.  The Humboldt neighborhood in Portland can probably best be described as young, urban and hip. The streets are busied with bike traffic, foot-traffic and buses cruising by every few minutes. This area is a hot-spot for the 20-30ish Portland crowd looking for easy access to downtown and the ever-cool Boise neighborhood which is known to most as "Mississippi" due to its most popular and populated street, Historic Mississippi Ave. Mississippi is a destination for many out of area out of neighborhood visitors and Humboldt enjoys the spill over traffic coming up to its famous coffee shop, The Albina Press. Atlas Tattoo, located a few doors down from the Albina Press, is Portland renowned for incredible ink work. The Red Fox is the very popular local watering hole.%0a%3c %0a%3c Locals here probably spend a lot of their time on Mississippi Avenue since they can walk there in less than five minutes or bike in a flash.  Mississippi has just about everything the average Humboldter could need: nearly a dozen great restaurants, great coffee shops, several watering holes (bars) and a lot of retail and boutique shops.  A few standouts on the street are Mississippi Street's Crow Bar, Amnesia Brewing, Gravy, Equinox, Por Que No?!, The Fresh Pot, Lorenzo's, Pistils Nursery and Miss Delta.  It should also be noted that Humboldt and Mississippi are home to mostly independent businesses.  You won't find a Starbucks here and locals will see to it that you don't.%0a%3c %0a%3c Portland Community College is a major presence in the Humboldt area and many residents are also students or faculty. Nearby Williams Avenue offers even more independent retail and boutiques in addition to standouts Lompoc's 5Q (Fifth Quarter) and Pix Patisserie and Ristretto Roasters.  Additionally, Killingsworth Street has several really great local businesses to choose from such as Saraveza (a beer bottle shop), The Red E Cafe, E'njoni Ethiopian Cafe and CoffeeHouse-Five.

Major freeway ramps located near Irvington include I-84 and I-5. Portland’s Tri Met runs bus schedules, and the MAX light rail train is only blocks away from Irvington’s Southernmost boundary, at Lloyd Center Mall. Drive West over the Broadway bridge to get downtown or to the Pearl District in mere minutes, or head Northeast to Alberta or Beaumont-Wilshire, Northwest to the Boise/Eliot and Historic Mississippi Avenue neighborhoods, or Southeast to get to the Belmont and Hawthorne neighborhoods.  Portland’s Irvington neighborhood cannot be easily characterized. On its southern border is a sizeable strip of restaurants, bars, coffee houses, personal service establishments, and shop after shop. In this section of Irvington is the array between bars with video lottery and shops with expensive lingerie. Irvington’s northern border is primarily residential, but where commercialism pops through tends to be high-end. And on its east and west sit two large parks.%0a%3c %0a%3c In between? Well, this is the kind of neighborhood for which people enter the American dream. The houses, each unique and almost all attractive with their ancient trees and flowing green lawns, seem the picture of Americana that we agreed to when we entered the game. The children playing seem palpably blessed to have this as their foundation. And driving through you can almost hear the promise of a simpler country and a simpler time if we just hold onto neighborhoods like it.  Several grand dame old homes are located here, and many are on the National Register of Historic Places. Back when they were constructed, Irvington homes were considered upper middle class. The sense of Irvington history can be found in more than just the homes. The exclusive Irvington Club for tennis was founded in 1898. And, if you pay attention while strolling the streets, you’ll notice many sidewalks imprinted with the original craftsman’s name and date (”E. Wiles 1908”) and you’ll even find an occasional metal ring still attached to the curb, from back in the days when everyone had horses to tie up instead of automobiles to park.%0a%3c %0a%3c Like any neighborhood that has been around since the turn of the last century, Irvington has suffered from periodic slumps over the years. Some houses fell into disrepair, and here and there a house was demolished and replaced with a “modern” mid-century apartment or commercial building. But overall, if you enjoy historic charm and unique homes with fine character and craftsmanship, you’ll love Irvington.  %0a%3c %0a%3c Irvington is a classic American neighborhood, with beautiful older homes, manicured lawns, enormous mature trees, and quiet streets with sidewalks made for evening strolls. Live in Irvington if you appreciate the joys of owning an older home, (or enjoy restoration projects), and appreciate the classic appeal of an old established neighborhood. There are also plenty of rentals in the area. This is a also great location if living in a well-known, prestigious Portland neighborhood is important to you. Other benefits of Irvington include the convenience of being near shopping, walking to the coffee shop in the morning, and becoming a part of the community.%0a%3c %0a%3c Northeast Knott Street runs through the heart of Irvington and is lined with some of Irvington’s most beautiful homes. Each year during the Christmas season a group of owners open their homes to the public.

Once predominantly African-American, the neighborhood has rapidly gentrified since the 1990s and attracted more young, mostly white residents. It was previously an area of high crime rates related to gang activity, poverty, and the crack epidemic of the 1980–1990s.

Woodlawn neighborhood is the oldest settled area in the old Albina area -- now referred to as the Woodlawn Historic District. Initially settled in the 1860's as a rural farming village, it was the only independent town that existed outside the city of Albina (now Portland). Woodlawn's character changed dramatically in 1888 when the railroad running from Portland to Vancouver located a train station in the center of the village. This connection to a larger market stimulated commercial and residential development. The commercial uses centered around the train station with homes development surrounding the city center. The train depot was located at the intersection of today's Durham and Dekum avenues and the station's waiting room was built in the middle of a triangular park which is still present today. %0a%3c %0a%3c Woodlawn is a commonly overlooked neighborhood as it seems somewhat tucked away. Bordering industrial north and northeast Portland, Woodlawn really is a little gem of a neighborhood which is being slowly but surely built into a wonderful family oriented neighborhood. New businesses have popped up in the last few years such as: Buffalo Gardens, Woodlawn Coffee and Pastry and Breakside Brewery are local hangouts and area favorites. Others like the Good Neighbor Pizzeria shop and The Firehouse, are well known staples having weathered the early dormant years. The Firehouse is a must-visit restaurant, well known for their excellent wood-fired pizzas and amazing locally sourced dishes served in a beautiful and unique dining setting.  Like the neighboring communities, Woodlawn homes are fantastic turn-of-the-last-century classics such as Bungalows, Cape Cods, a few Victorians and Four squares.  Tree-lined, crooked streets are very quiet and mostly well maintained.  %0a%3c %0a%3c Woodlawn School is connected to the Community Garden which is connected to Woodlawn Park -which is complete with a fun water feature and big basketball court- making for a huge neighborhood gathering area. Nearly all the businesses in Woodlawn are locally owned. %0a%3c %0a%3c Woodlawn boasts a wonderful view of Vancouver, Washington at night. There are over 14 buildings on the historic registry in our small area.  Cyclists have often been the very few "outsiders" to navigate Woodlawn as once one knows the diagonals, Woodlawn is an excellent cut-through when coming from Jantzen Beach or other northern destinations. One would gather that it's also a neighborhood that is home to cyclists, as "Share the Road" and "My other car is a bike" bumper stickers abound. Cyclist residents enjoy the calm streets and proximity to downtown (4 miles).%0a%3c %0a%3c In the 1920's, paved major roads, the improved automobile and a bridge between Vancouver and Portland gave residents more shopping options and businesses in Woodlawn were either swept aside for housing or converted to factories. Woodlawn is 15 minutes travel time by car to Washington, 10 minutes to the Portland International Airport, 15 minutes to downtown Portland and 15 minutes to excellent shopping malls in good traffic conditions. Woodlawn is well served by buses and freight trains glide by at the base of the bluff. Some residents move here because they love the sight and sound of trains. Many residents commute by bicycle to their jobs. The proximity to the airport has caused some issues due to plane noise.%0a%3c Atop the bluff, Woodlawn is mostly residential, with Queen Annes, Craftsman bungalows, and an influx of modern infill housing and condos. Some of those homes are occupied by families who have lived in Woodlawn for six generations. In the 40's and 50's many ranch and smaller homes were built throughout the neighborhood to house the working class residents and evacuees of the Vanport Flood. Many of the Vanport people had worked in the shipyards during WW2.%0a%3c %0a%3c Woodlawn is a very desirable neighborhood with the Woodlawn Park as a centerpiece. Art and culture are eagerly supported here, and overflow crowds attend the productions of Trek in the Park each summer. Woodlawn in the 21st century has fascinating businesses and unique landmarks. In recent years there’s been a revitalization of businesses along Dekum, as envisioned in the 1993 Woodlawn Plan. We have exquisite pastry and coffee houses, fabulous restaurants, a brewpub, and a public benefit pub, a movement studio and a massage studio, a resale shop, a bicycle repair shop, ceramic studios, plant nurseries and many other fascinating businesses. The newest addition to the commercial triangle is a LEED Platinum remodel of a historic building housing a company that makes high quality, locally sourced, organic foods for local businesses. Light and heavy industrial businesses flank the current train route, as do a variety of businesses that need space, such as plant nurseries. %0a---%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

During that time, Northeast Broadway, one of the district’s main thoroughfares, evolved naturally into a busy strip of restaurants and shops needed to support Portland’s growing eastside population. Although modern automobile travel and convenient MAX light rail service render many of the Northeast neighborhoods a quick 7-10 -minute jaunt to Portland’s downtown core, Northeast Portland seems charmingly detached from the bustle of the city center.%0a%3c %0a%3c The seeds of gentrification were planted during World War II, when African Americans from the South flowed into Portland to take jobs in the shipyards. Portland officials and community members, from real estate agents to bankers, pushed the black community into a small area called Lower Albina, near the present-day Rose Quarter, through redlining and other now-illegal practices. White Portlanders fled, and the city began a long pattern of disinvestment. Street and sidewalk repairs were neglected, and the city did little to develop businesses or enforce housing codes, said Dr. Karen Gibson, the PSU professor, who wrote a study in 2007 called Bleeding Albina: A History of Community Disinvestment, 1940-2000.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25'''Farmers Markets'''%0a%3c *'''Hollywood Farmers Market''' ''Northeast Hancock Street between 44th and 45th avenues.
