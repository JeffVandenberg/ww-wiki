His clothing usually ranges from sleek, up and coming gangster to stylish street punk, but his black leather jacket is a constant almost in any situation.  Smirking seems to be his default expression, but his eyes are what stand out to most astute observers. Often his easy smile doesn’t ever quite reach his eyes, which are always looking, always assessing.’ %0a%0a!!%25vampire%25Personality%0a%0aLike many Kindred, Harvey is adapt at wearing many masks, but the one most see is a too cool for school smart ass who wears his status as a criminal scumbag like its a badge of honor. He’s a rebel at heart and has little tolerance for traditions, standards, and customs that he deems to be outdate, out of touch, or plain old useless. %0aHe’s also developed a reputation as a Kindred who’s loyal and protective to those he chooses to call friend.

He wasn’t really expected to survive, but he did and eventually earned a bit of a reputation as being a scrappy and resourceful Kindred while serving in a variety of roles - scout, sniper, intel, logistical weapons and gear support. Maybe you served with Harvey? Maybe you fought against him. He belongs to the Society of Cinders now and is an active supporter of his fellow veterans. %0a%0a!!!!!%25bgcolor=black vampire%25 '''Smack Head (All):''' %0aIts no secret Harvey is a junkie. He had a thing for heroin before his embrace. He kept it under control - sorta - during the great war, but when peace time came his old friend Heroin came calling. And Harvey was more than happy to answer the call. Maybe you’ve got stoned with Harvey? Maybe you’ve tried to clean him up? %0a%0a!!!!!%25bgcolor=black vampire%25 '''The Devil’s Handyman (Crime):''' %0aIn certain circles, that’s what they call Harvey. The Russian Mob were the first to give him that name, but its spread throughout the underworld. He’s an illegal jack of all illicit trades. Need some illegal modifications to some weaponry? Perhaps a little cyber crime? Paranoid the police are bugging your place and want to sweep? Or maybe you just need someone who can cook up a good car bomb? The Devil’s Handyman does it all and if you can pay the price, he’ll do it for you. %0a%0a!!!!!%25bgcolor=black vampire%25 '''Brodyaga (Crime):''' %0aEver notice how Harvey knows all about good vodka? And has a surprising fluency in Russian curse words? And a lot of friends named Boris? Well, it all comes with being a soldier in the Bratva. He’s viewed by many as a rising star in the Russian Mob and known for always having the right tools and people for the right job.%0a %0a!!!!!%25bgcolor=black vampire%25 '''Citizen’s Brigade (Carthian):''' %0aHarvey is the founder and First Marshall of the Citizen’s Brigade, a group of militant minded Carthians determined to defend the Movement, enforce its laws, and spread its ideals. The group is a natural outlet for ruffians, knuckle draggers, thugs, and other malcontents. Harvey though is intent on molding it into something else. Something far more formidable. %0a%0a!!%25vampire%25 Hip Places%0a[[Konev Brothers Salvage and Recycling]] '''(Crime/Kindred)''' Formerly known as Jameson Auto Salvage, the junkyard is now under the ownership and management of the Konev brothers, who are known to have ties to the Russian Mob. Harvey uses the scrapyard as an informal base of operations for both his various criminal enterprises and occasionally to conduct certain Kindred related business. %0a%0a----%0a(:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a%0a(:cellnr width=100%25:)%0a!!%25vampire%25 Chatter%0a%0a*%25vampire%25“Yeah, I can make that shit happen.

He wasn’t really expected to survive, but he did and eventually earned a bit of a reputation as being a scrappy and resourceful Kindred while serving in a variety of roles - scout, sniper, intel, logistical weapons and gear support.

And Harvey was more than happy to answer the call. Maybe you’ve got stoned with Harvey? Maybe you’ve tried to clean him up? %0a> %0a> '''The Devil’s Handyman (Crime)''' In certain circles, that’s what they call Harvey. The Russian Mob were the first to give him that name, but its spread throughout the underworld. He’s an illegal jack of all illicit trades. Need some illegal modifications to some weaponry? Perhaps a little cyber crime? Paranoid the police are bugging your place and want to sweep? Or maybe you just need someone who can cook up a good car bomb? The Devil’s Handyman does it all and if you can pay the price, he’ll do it for you. %0a> %0a> '''Brodyaga (Crime)''' Ever notice how Harvey knows all about good vodka? And has a surprising fluency in Russian curse words? And a lot of friends named Boris? Well, it all comes with being a soldier in the Bratva. He’s viewed by many as a rising star in the Russian Mob and known for always having the right tools and people for the right job.%0a>  %0a> '''Citizen’s Brigade (Carthian)''' Harvey is the founder and First Marshall of the Citizen’s Brigade, a group of militant minded Carthians determined to defend the Movement, enforce its laws, and spread its ideals. The group is a natural outlet for ruffians, knuckle draggers, thugs, and other malcontents. Harvey though is intent on molding it into something else. Something far more formidable. %0a> %0a> !!%25vampire%25 Hip Places%0a> [[Konev Brothers Salvage and Recycling]] '''(Crime/Kindred)''' Formerly known as Jameson Auto Salvage, the junkyard is now under the ownership and management of the Konev brothers, who are known to have ties to the Russian Mob.

Just clean up before they realize we aren’t screwing.” - Ana Walker%0a%3c %0a%3c %25vampire%25*”We all have shadows, but knowing that this Shadow is behind me? I feel safer and more secure than I thought I could.” - Greer Renatus%0a%3c %0a%3c %25vampire%25*“You don’t usually see such ambition in a Junkie. Some habits are harder to break than others. We’ll have to see which one goes first.” - Mustang %0a%3c %0a%3c %25vampire%25*“I believe Mr. Wallson is going to get me in to trouble one day, but it is so rare to find someone with such a similar taste and interest in music that I do not mind the possibility one bit.” - Esme %0a%3c %0a%3c %25werewolf%25*“A likable asshole…..that I really need to remember not to taunt during pool.” - Brook %0a%3c %0a%3c %25vampire%25*“I’m not sure I could make a more complete and total opposite of myself in terms of personality, but make no mistake: He is definitely no fool.” - Notary Martin %0a%3c %0a%3c %25vampire%25*“I like him. I really, really hope I can trust him.” - Lorelei Bowen %0a%3c %0a%3c %25vampire%25*“I was seeing this woman, Roxanne,” he began. “We were living together. She was thirty something, right? Five feet even and despite the years starting to add up, she was tight. From the top of her head to the bottom of her feet, tight. She used to wear a bra when she slept she was that tight. Are you picking up what I'm putting down?" -Michael Black %0a%3c %0a%3c %25vampire%25* “Maybe he’s more perceptive than he lets on. Maybe he’s more capable than you might think. Maybe he’s worth watching. Maybe this is all just a waste of time.” - Primogen Walker (Before) %0a%3c %0a%3c %25vampire%25* “Very few kindred get to choose their sires. I was lucky enough to have Harvey in my life when I was given a choice. He’s everything I need him to be and a bunch extra that is just fun.” - Lorelei %0a%3c %0a%3c %25vampire%25“Somewhere between Rick Springfield and dancing in my living room I felt something that I haven’t felt in almost a century. Something I never thought would happen again. I haven’t said the words, but I think he knows.” - Uptown Girl %0a%3c %0a%3c %25mage%25“I like the old man. Got a good sense of humor or at the very least laughs at my smart ass remarks. Do I trust him? Oh hell no. But, I don’t trust many.” - Fujin %0a%3c %0a%3c %25vampire%25“Thank you for being there when I hit rock bottom, for taking a chance on us, and for loving me. Most importantly, thank you for freeing me be me. I’m expecting one hell of a ride and you haven’t let me down yet.” - The New Recruit %0a%3c %0a%3c %25vampire%25“I see you.” - Samuel Walker %0a%3c %0a%3c %25vampire%25“Harvey’s like that cool older brother you always want to hang out with because the party never ends. He has the best drugs, great taste in music, and can hold a deep intelligent conversation with the best of them.” -Frau Doktor %0a%3c %0a%3c %25mortal%25“I’ve known you for years, but the past few months you went from a work associate to a friend, and even more recently I felt like I’ve really started to see you for who you are. We have a past, but I’m more interested in our future these days.” -Layla%0a
