Some try to reclaim their old, but others just want to start fresh. For those latter, the members of the Onyx Court refer to “Thalia”. Often she is able to put a roof over the head of a brand new Lost at no cost while the paperwork is put together to give them a new life. While they wait for that faux-life on paper, Jackie is happy to be their friend and counselor to help them adjust to the tragedy they have endured. %0a%0a%0a!!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''Selfless Jackie (Changelings)'': %0aWhile Jackie’s main role within the Winter Court is to assist in hiding new Lost, helping them start fresh and generally being a sympathetic ear, there are many others as well.

Even off the job she keeps the heavier eyeliner and lifts, but goes for a more casual dress that can tend to be a little tomboy-ish at times. Despite being in Miami’s heat, her fair skin never seems to burn or get warm, always cold to the touch. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Mein''%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25 Some believe Jackie got lucky with her durance to end up looking so similar to her mask in appearance. With hair changing to the soft pink of rose petals and snow as perfectly pale as fresh powdered snow. Her mantle permeates throughout her body and causes small ice crystals to form in her skin which bring an occasional sparkle when the light catches her right. She’ll admit from time to time that she cheats a little by using what she calls “magical makeup”, but she has yet to reveal what the secret to it is.%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''Gallery'''%0a%3c %0a%3c || border=1%0a%3c || %25thumb newwin%25[[https://i.pinimg.com/564x/e1/8a/75/e18a752175732fc75c7f856f2891bd04.jpg|https://i.pinimg.com/564x/e1/8a/75/e18a752175732fc75c7f856f2891bd04.jpg]] || %25thumb newwin%25[[https://i.pinimg.com/564x/52/d0/67/52d0677cd0efcfd289814ac02931ebf8.jpg|https://i.pinimg.com/564x/52/d0/67/52d0677cd0efcfd289814ac02931ebf8.jpg]] || %25thumb newwin%25[[https://i.pinimg.com/564x/61/72/42/617242a36bf9adbcf3aa3a2f3013e3bf.jpg|https://i.pinimg.com/564x/61/72/42/617242a36bf9adbcf3aa3a2f3013e3bf.jpg]] ||%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c (:div2end:)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''Contacts'''%0a%3c %0a%3c ||! %25changeling%25Image ||! %25changeling%25Name ||! %25changeling%25Relationship ||! %25changeling%25Comment ||! %25changeling%25Ringtone ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c %0a%3c (:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''Hooks'''%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''A Sympathetic Ear (Anyone)'': %0a%3c Working as a local bartender at the Second Circle, Jackie is known for lending her ear to troubled patrons and being a shoulder to cry on when times get rough. Always the attentive listener, her cheerful personality has a tendency to remove some of the sorrow from the one confiding and replace it with kind words and friendly advice. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''New Lives for New Faces (Changelings)'': %0a%3c There are a number of Lost who find they can’t return to their normal lives once they return from the Hedge. Some try to reclaim their old, but others just want to start fresh. For those latter, the members of the Onyx Court refer to “Thalia”. Often she is able to put a roof over the head of a brand new Lost at no cost while the paperwork is put together to give them a new life. While they wait for that faux-life on paper, Jackie is happy to be their friend and counselor to help them adjust to the tragedy they have endured. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''Selfless Jackie (Changelings)'': %0a%3c While Jackie’s main role within the Winter Court is to assist in hiding new Lost, helping them start fresh and generally being a sympathetic ear, there are many others as well. Those who share a court, or who have proven to be able to mind their secrets, have the opportunity to see the broken creature behind the cheerful mask that is Thalia and why it lives the many lives it does.%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c (:div2end:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:cellnr width=100%25:)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''Quotes'''%0a%3c %0a%3c Watch This Space\\%0a%3c %0a%3c (:tableend:)%0a%3c (:include GameRef.Directoryplayerchangeling:)%0a%3c %0a
