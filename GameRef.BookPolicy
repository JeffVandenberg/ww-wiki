The Onyx Path anticipates publishing the rules for Changeling: the Lost 2E this fall, but there is always a chance for delay.

Changeling Caveat%0a%3c When approaching WW5, because The Onyx Path is producing a new system of books (Chronicles of Darkness aka 2E), we had made it a policy to only produce games where a published book is available to all players and staff. The Onyx Path anticipates publishing the rules for Changeling: the Lost 2E this fall, but there is always a chance for delay. However, because of the popularity of the Changeling venue and the anticipation of this publication date, we have decided to launch the Changeling venue with the advanced preview of the character creation rules that The Onyx Path has provided.%0a%3c \\%0a%3c For this reason, we wanted to also notify our potential Changeling players of a rather major Caveat Emptor (Buyer Beware): When the book is published there may be changes to elements of character creation (for example, kith or seeming effects, changeling merits, fae-touched merits, etc.) If this is the case, your character will be modified to reflect the official, published rules. There will be no grandfathering.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!

Cross-Venue Merit Policy%0a%3c Some books contain merits that are appropriate for those of other character types, and for the sake of player convenience they’ve been listed here with their appropriate sources.%0a%3c \\%0a%3c Note that any prerequisites listed must still be met. An * by the merit means that it always requires Justification, or a background explanation at creation. A ^ means not available at creation, but can be gained ICly. Both only apply to those outside of the given book’s faction (So, a Changeling can buy Hedge Sense at creation with no issue, for instance).%0a%3c \\%0a%3c Finally, no merit listed grants access to template abilities, unique merits (other than those listed here), or powers of other Factions; Order Status won’t let a Vampire learn Rotes, Goodwill doesn’t let a Mage learn Court Contracts or Goblin Vow, and Chorister won’t let a Werewolf learn Cruac, for instance.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!
