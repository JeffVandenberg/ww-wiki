Armed with a polished smile, forest green eyes and a reverse bob with side tails, tied with pink ribbon. Aion is ready for for battle on the field or in a bar. Autumnss clothing tends to either be a suit and slacks combo, or some equally classic skirt and blouse. Aion's voice has a real calm bewitching tone, that bears the mild accent of nowhere middle america. The only jewelry she wears is platinum and rose gold anklet with a stylized sun and moon charm. (Striking Looks 2: Androgynous, Captivating)%0a%0aEnsorcelled: To the eyes of the Fae, Changelings and such creatures Autumns ears grow into fine elven points, her emerald eyes become crimson set with a lunargent limbal ring and small upper fangs. The heat that used to encompass her in a haze gives her skin a lambent quality as lunargent embers burn off of her. Settled behind her head and shoulders is the mark of her sovereignty and title as witnessed by the Wyrd, a luminous Lunar disk glowed behind her shattered through in three sections reflecting the rich color of the harvest moon.%0a%0a----%0a%0a!! %25center%25https://i.imgur.com/Wa6YH0p.png%0a%0a!!!!! %25center%25https://i.imgur.com/Yfve8bT.png%0a%0aCertainty: Aion's nimbus brings forth the confidence to face your woes, those around Aion lose sight of their uncertainty and cast the die.

When there's no quest icon over your friends head, there's no sorting hat for your Hogwarts house and no idea where you should be in the world, thats where Aion comes to intercede. While considered a recruiter at times for the Adamantine Arrow, Aion is more likely to help you get down the basics and find what order will best help you grow, or if the lone path is yours to take. %0a%0a!!!!!%25bgcolor=black mage%25 Wu-Tang is for the Children (Musicians/Artists): %0a%0aIt's no secret that Aion's been in music for some time from the simple enjoyment of Belting out Black Flag, Queen or the Wu-Tang clan you are going to find a kindred spirit. On a more professional level Aion can be found behind a drum kit, plugging in stage equipment, spending hours pouring over production equipment or on the rare occassion behind a microphone. If music is your love or you want to get somewhere in the entertainment world, perhaps you have met.%0a%0a!!!!!%25bgcolor=black mage%25 How about something more refined? (Linguists, Anime/Manga Fans): %0a%0aPerhaps not one to give it away on first glance but Aion is something of a fan when it comes to anime to the point of developing the ability to watch it without subs (or dub you heathen). Aion keeps up on all the latest series, and has a firm appreciation for several genres, perhaps you too enjoy the fruits of Japanese culture, or just would like someone to talk to in your mother tongue.%0a%0a!!!!!%25bgcolor=black mage%25 “Curiouser and curiouser!”  (Mages and fellow Acanthus): %0a%0aIt is the twisting of fate and time that bring an Acanthus to where they must be, to find new places, to explore and know both the worlds within and the worlds within. Aion has a great interest on anything pertaining to her supernal realm Aracadia and it is never hard to talk her into an adventure.%0a%0a!!!!!%25bgcolor=black mage%25 “Long Live the Queen”  (Acanthus and Arrows): %0a%0aIt is by no amount of wisdom and skill that Autumn has used the knowledge of the past to codify a legacy of her own design, based upon a series of journals during the 100 years war she found a way to unlock this knowledge. Her legacy binds a Fae Title into the very soul of the awakened and the wyrd itself witnesses their claim as Exiled Nobles of Arcadia, her title is "Queen Selene, The First of Many to Come." Perhaps you will be the second to claim your broken crown.%0a%0a!!!!!%25bgcolor=black mage%25  "The Dark Seasons”  (Changelings/Mages): %0a%0aAutumn has proven herself a capable mage and politician with focusing her concerns for the Awakened and the Lost, from this she has garnered respect from the Autumn and Winter courts for her actions in their defense, as well as becoming the Emissary between her people and theirs.
