Sharp eyes and a severe jaw are often shaded by the brim of an old-fashioned hat. There is a startling efficiency in his motion, and a stony face suggests an economy of feeling as well. The lingering look of a permanent thousand-yard stare suggests a dangerous kind of indifference. %0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=5px lframe width=500px bgcolor=white border='5px solid black' padding=2px%25https://i.imgur.com/DO2O4Rw.jpg%0a!!%25center%25%25vampire%25'''Personality'''%0aJohn is predisposed to a calculating kind of melancholy, but when something or someone catches his eye, he can be stirred to decisive action. His ruthlessly transactional view of the world is backed up by a serious commitment to his word. He enjoys risks of all sorts, and has a gourmand's taste for dangers.%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25vampire%25'''Scattered Memories'''%0aJohn's existence--tortured as it is--has stretched back beyond mortal memory.

They act as a broker between companies and concerns needing goods shipped and owner/operator truck drivers who want to carry shipping containers across the country. This legitimate veneer is the tip of an iceberg for an extensive smuggling network. John Murphy controls the ghouls who run the company and oversees tremendous amounts of money that the First Estate and other investors run through it. Need something shipped?

When he's not plying his bloody trade, he attends clubs and concerts--anywhere live music is playing. John will also gig with other musicians on guitar, bass, or violin.
