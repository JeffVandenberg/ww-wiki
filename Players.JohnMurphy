Sharp eyes and a severe jaw are often shaded by the brim of an old-fashioned hat. There is a startling efficiency in his motion, and a stony face suggests an economy of feeling as well.

When he's not plying his bloody trade, he attends clubs and concerts--anywhere live music is playing. John will also gig with other musicians on guitar, bass, or violin. His fellows know that John could play professionally if he wanted, but the man engages in zero self-promotion.%0a%0a!!!!%25vampire%25 ''Now the Only Thing a Gambler Needs...:'' %0aJohn is well-versed in games of chance and he loves a good wager. To the mystification of his peers, he prefers draw poker to hold'em but John knows that he has to compromise if he wants other people at his table. You may have played a few hands with John, or rubbed elbows in the places where such illicit activity takes place.%0a%0a!!!!%25mortal%25 Crossover Averse %0aThe player actively avoids crossover and characters/situations with a high degree of crossover connection in order to simplify play and focus on the themes of Vampire: the Requiem. %0a%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25vampire%25'''Contacts'''%0a||! %25vampire%25Image ||! %25vampire%25Name ||! %25vampire%25Relationship ||! %25vampire%25Comment ||! %25vampire%25Ringtone ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/5YXWc7C.jpg || %25vampire%25[[Prism Tacit]] || %25vampire%25My Doll || %25vampire%25What's a little blood between friends? || %25newwin%25[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFc2Qs49VkA|%25vampire%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/cl0Nyvh.png || %25vampire%25[[Zach Sullivan]] || %25vampire%25Paternal Instinct || %25vampire%25He's a good kid. || %25newwin%25[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OqwKfgLaeA|%25vampire%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/y0JDDAM.jpg || %25vampire%25[[Victoria Messini]] || %25vampire%25Coterie-Mate || %25vampire%25Pretty sure she's a maniac. || %25newwin%25[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbH-U2b_EsQ|%25vampire%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lr7rdrCzY71r2m3nco1_640.jpg || %25vampire%25[[Reya Jha]] || %25vampire%25Coterie-Mate || %25vampire%25She has probably forgotten more than I have ever known. || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25vampire%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a(:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a%0a(:cellnr width=100%25:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25vampire%25'''Quotes'''%0a%25mortal%25 "Half the people lie with their lips; the other half with their tears." &#8213; Nassim Nicholas Taleb, The Bed of Procrustes. \\%0a%0a%25color=#FF96A5%25 "I would like to be the air that inhabits you for a moment only.
