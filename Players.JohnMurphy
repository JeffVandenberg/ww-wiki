Sharp eyes and a severe jaw are often shaded by the brim of an old-fashioned hat. There is a startling efficiency in his motion, and a stony face suggests an economy of feeling as well. The lingering look of a permanent thousand-yard stare suggests a dangerous kind of indifference. %0a%0a!!%25center%25%25vampire%25'''Personality'''%0a%0a%25center%25John is predisposed to a calculating kind of melancholy, but when something or someone catches his eye, he can be stirred to decisive action. His ruthlessly transactional view of the world is backed up by a serious commitment to his word. He enjoys risks of all sorts, and has a gourmand's taste for dangers.%0a %0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25vampire%25'''Stolen Shapes'''%0a(:cellnr align=center  style='background-color:black;' :)%25width=300px%25https://i.imgur.com/fNsqH4Y.png%0a(:cell align=center  style='background-color:black;' :)%25width=300px%25https://i.imgur.com/M7ZfVp8.jpg%0a(:cell align=center  style='background-color:black;' :)%25width=300px%25https://i.imgur.com/CItXjiB.jpg%0a(:tableend:)%0a%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25vampire%25'''Hooks'''%0a%0a!!!!%25vampire%25 ''Fixer'' %0aJohn Murphy is clever, creative, and deeply mercenary. The major players in several spheres of influence know how to reach out to him for his assistance. He has his requirements, however: a share of the outcome, and the active participant of the principal. Everyone must have skin in the game.%0a%0a!!!!%25vampire%25 ''Children of the Night--What Music they Make'' %0aMusic is one of few things that stirs John's world-weary passions. When he's not plying his bloody trade, he attends clubs and concerts--anywhere live music is playing. John will also gig with other musicians on guitar, bass, or violin. His fellows know that John could play professionally if he wanted, but the man engages in zero self-promotion.%0a%0a!!!!%25vampire%25 ''Now the Only Thing a Gambler Needs...'' %0aJohn is well-versed in games of chance and he loves a good wager. To the mystification of his peers, he prefers draw poker to hold'em but John knows that he has to compromise if he wants other people at his table. You may have played a few hands with John, or rubbed elbows in the places where such illicit activity takes place.%0a%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25vampire%25'''Agents'''%0a(:cellnr align=center:)[++[[Prism Tacit]]++]%0a(:cell align=center:)[++Isaac Rice++]%0a(:cell align=center:)[++Terry Maldia++]%0a(:cellnr align=center  style='background-color:black;' :)%25width=300px%25https://i.imgur.com/5YXWc7C.jpg %0a(:cell align=center  style='background-color:black;' :)%25width=300px%25https://i.imgur.com/7Mm499f.jpg%0a(:cell align=center  style='background-color:black;' :)%25width=300px%25https://i.imgur.com/St4keKx.jpg %0a(:cellnr align=center:)Most Favored%0a(:cell align=center:)Logistics Expert%0a(:cell align=center:)Fabricator%0a(:tableend:)%0a%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25vampire%25'''Contacts'''%0a|| %25thumb%25http://www.imgurupload.com/images/2020/02/04/annelise3.jpg || %25vampire%25[[Annelise Berthold]] || %25vampire%25Old Associate || %25vampire%25How do I know the Invictus are right?
