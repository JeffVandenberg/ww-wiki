There's a dollup of freckles on a face thats just this side of attractive, as late teens tend to be just before things kick in one way or another.

It is something of a mimic, a cousin, perhaps, to shapeshifters like John Carpenter's The Thing. It has a human head, or rather, humanish; the eyes are slightly too big, and the color of them is an unearthly yellow; the mouth slightly too large and the teeth are those of sharks and wolves. The body of the beast, if it can be called such, writhes and undulates in a constantly shifting mass of tendrils that can assume most if any shapes it wills - a humanoid form can be achieved easily, though it would look as if it was molded from ropy muscle and tendril. %0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25beast%25'''Contacts'''%0a%0a||! %25beast%25Image ||! %25beast%25Name ||! %25beast%25Relationship ||! %25beast%25Comment ||! %25beast%25Ringtone ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/AsPSVr7.png || %25beast%25PC Name || %25beast%25Relationship to PC || %25beast%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25beast%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/AsPSVr7.png || %25beast%25PC Name || %25beast%25Relationship to PC || %25beast%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25beast%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/AsPSVr7.png || %25beast%25PC Name || %25beast%25Relationship to PC || %25beast%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25beast%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/AsPSVr7.png || %25beast%25PC Name || %25beast%25Relationship to PC || %25beast%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25beast%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/AsPSVr7.png || %25beast%25PC Name || %25beast%25Relationship to PC || %25beast%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25beast%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25beast%25'''Hooks'''%0a%0a!!!!%25beast%25 ''Hook 1(Who it effects)'': %0aHook info here%0a%0a!!!!%25beast%25 ''Hook 2(Who it effects)'': %0aHook info here%0a%0a!!!!%25beast%25 ''Hook 3(Who it effects)'': %0aHook info here%0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a(:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a%0a(:cellnr width=100%25:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25beast%25'''Quotes'''%0a%0a%25mortal%25 "I am a quote!
