Gangly, tall and thin, moving with a loose-jointed awkwardness that seems to speak of an age that's younger than she actually is. Her hair is straight and auburn of color, with the pale skin of one that might have stayed indoors for most of their lives. There's a dollup of freckles on a face that's just this side of attractive, as late teens tend to be just before things kick in one way or another. Fashion tends to be utilitarian and typical of freshman fare, perhaps a little on the ragged side compared to most of the other students in a private school. %0a%0aHer Horror is the BAD TRIP, the accidental ingesting of deliriants by cavemen, the spiked drink of LSD taken by a person attending bible camp, a deep dream made manifest. A tall humanoid that is flesh undulate, too rich in tone, too many variants in color, eyes where they should not be, eyes all over, and visions flickering in and out of her person; was that an animal in her hair?%0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25beast%25'''Contacts'''%0a%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/1AoAcws.jpg || [[Players.TerryHeide |%25beast%25 Terry]] || %25beast%25Big Brother || %25beast%25Something of a mentor, something of a puzzle || %25newwin%25[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M-jOZRe0-8|%25beast%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/AsPSVr7.png || %25beast%25PC Name || %25beast%25Relationship to PC || %25beast%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25beast%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/AsPSVr7.png || %25beast%25PC Name || %25beast%25Relationship to PC || %25beast%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25beast%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/AsPSVr7.png || %25beast%25PC Name || %25beast%25Relationship to PC || %25beast%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25beast%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/AsPSVr7.png || %25beast%25PC Name || %25beast%25Relationship to PC || %25beast%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25beast%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/AsPSVr7.png || %25beast%25PC Name || %25beast%25Relationship to PC || %25beast%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25beast%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25beast%25'''Hooks'''%0a%0a!!!!%25beast%25 ''Yes, I am a professor...

Gazing at her is a arctic water plunge into the Uncanny Valley: her skin is mostly blue-gray splotches and stripes, her skull is elongated to the point of grotesquerie, her ears pointed and alien, and when she smiles her teeth are a mixed atrociousness of shark and wolf. %0a

It is something of a mimic, a very distant cousin, perhaps, to shapeshifters like John Carpenter's The Thing, or the classic ufologist's Gray if it shacked up with a classic folklore doppleganger. Gazing at her is a arctic water plunge into the Uncanny Valley: her skin is mostly blue-gray splotches and stripes, her skull is elongated to the point of grotesquerie, her ears pointed and alien, and when she smiles her teeth are a mixed atrociousness of shark and wolf. %0a---%0a> Her Horror really doesn't have a name as such, never bothering with such over the eons - best not to have a name and stay hidden among the morass of numbers.
