Portland is certainly a special place and The Special Hell embodies that.  Come for the dancers and get a feast for your eyes while fires are ignited within you.  Come for the food and savor the nostalgia of past meals with friends.  Come for the drinks and experience the truly fantastic flavors the Special Hell has to offer: things found no where else.  The Atmosphere will draw you in and threaten to turn your world upside down as your heart races with excitement.  Come indulge in a fantasy for an evening and let go of your worries.%0a%0aThe Special Hell is one of the more well known exotic clubs in Portland having been open for a few years now.  It's in a good part of downtown and in a refurbished stone exterior building with orange, red, pink, and yellow stained glass.  The doors are metal with a gothic flare and glass flames along them.  This isn't some low class place with carpet with cigarette burns in it: no no.  Upon walking in the door you're greeted with a marble floored lobby with a fiery symbol etched into the floor.  Opulent furniture fills the lobby while sconces burn with orange fiery light.  You haven't quite gone to hell yet, however.  A single hallway leads to the club with a burning pyre symbol at the end and flames along the walls.  It feels like you've been damned as you walk further before the club opens up on either side.  Bright reds, purples, oranges, and other colors fill the place while elegant decor enchants the senses.  Bright silver poles reflect the burning rainbow of lights while scantily clad dancers display their bodies and talents for all to see.  You're truly in a special hell now.%0a%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=25px margin-right=25px width=250px height=250px%25https://i.imgur.com/g6QmOQf.jpg%0a!! %25center%25%25color=#cc6633%25The Rules%0a%0a%25color=#cc6633%25You're not allowed to touch a dancer unless they're okay with it.

The lobby is where you first enter and you can hang coats, interact with the bouncers, and sometimes gain a glimpse of a dancer.  The lower floor in the main club is where most everything happens and it includes the one large stage and the smaller stages: all with poles.  The upper floor contains the VIP section and a place called "Bad Decision Island."  A few dressing rooms and a shower are in the back areas and a large kitchen offers opportunity for aspiring chefs to learn the trade.  %0a%0a!!! %25center%25%25color=#cc6633%25First Floor%0a%0aThe main floor has lots of seating for people and plenty of places to rest drinks while giving lots of opportunity to indulge in the sensual sights of a persons body as they lose more and more clothing.  Booths line the walls for a more private experience while the more open air seating has a higher opportunity for interacting with an enchanting dancer.  On event nights the main floor can be cleared to make way for a lot more people.%0a%0a%25newwin%25https://i.imgur.com/JTX6FLx.png %0a%0a!!! %25center%25%25color=#cc6633%25Second Floor%0a%0aThe second floor offers privacy and yet a view of the actions below.  A private party can enjoy the view while enjoying drinks of all kinds.  Bad Decision Island is part of the upstairs and it offers privacy and the opportunity for private dances from anyone of your choice should your cash be enough.  Some might even bend the rules a bit for you but it's all up to them.  Cross the line and pay the fine: being tossed out.%0a%0a(:tableend:)   %0a%0a(:table valign=top:)%0a(:cellnr width=700 colspan=2 align=center:)%0a%0a!! %25center%25%25color=#cc6633%25Dancers%0a%0a(:tableend:)  %0a%0a%0a(:table valign=top:)%0a(:cellnr width=700 colspan=2 align=center:)%0a%0a!! %25center%25%25color=#cc6633%25Bar%0a%0a|| border=2%0a||! %25color=#cc6633%25Image ||! %25color=#cc6633%25Drink  ||! %25color=#cc6633%25Effects ||! %25color=#cc6633%25What's in it? ||%0a|| %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/SqvVbqv.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/SqvVbqv.jpg]] || Ameretto Sour ||  Alcohol ||  The flavor of Ameretto dominates this drink but it's a sweet drink with tangy notes of lemon and lime. ||%0a|| %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/2Snx93S.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/2Snx93S.jpg]] || Autumn Wind ||  Crisp and clean ||  Purest water with a touch of minerals and a large ice cubes.

The lobby is where you first enter and you can hang coats, interact with the bouncers, and sometimes gain a glimpse of a dancer.  The lower floor in the main club is where most everything happens and it includes the one large stage and the smaller stages: all with poles.  The upper floor contains the VIP section and a place called "Bad Decision Island."  A few dressing rooms and a shower are in the back areas and a large kitchen offers opportunity for aspiring chefs to learn the trade.  %0a%3c %0a---%0a> %0a72,73d70%0a%3c The main floor has lots of seating for people and plenty of places to rest drinks while giving lots of opportunity to indulge in the sensual sights of a persons body as they lose more and more clothing.  Booths line the walls for a more private experience while the more open air seating has a higher opportunity for interacting with an enchanting dancer.  On event nights the main floor can be cleared to make way for a lot more people.%0a%3c %0a78,79d74%0a%3c The second floor offers privacy and yet a view of the actions below.  A private party can enjoy the view while enjoying drinks of all kinds.  Bad Decision Island is part of the upstairs and it offers privacy and the opportunity for private dances from anyone of your choice should your cash be enough.  Some might even bend the rules a bit for you but it's all up to them.  Cross the line and pay the fine: being tossed out.%0a%3c %0a86,87d80%0a%3c %0a%3c *Menu incoming*%0a

diff:1528940922:1527835409:=47,49c47,49%0a%3c Portland is a one of a kind place with a ton of wild and varied things to do from the strangely provocative, intensely passionate, to the weird and dark.  Portland is certainly a special place and The Special Hell embodies that.  Come for the dancers and get a feast for your eyes while fires are ignited within you.  Come for the food and savor the nostalgia of past meals with friends.  Come for the drinks and experience the truly fantastic flavors the Special Hell has to offer: things found no where else.  The Atmosphere will draw you in and threaten to turn your world upside down as your heart races with excitement.  Come indulge in a fantasy for an evening and let go of your worries.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Special Hell is one of the more well known exotic clubs in Portland having been open for a few years now.  It's in a good part of downtown and in a refurbished stone exterior building with orange, red, pink, and yellow stained glass.  The doors are metal with a gothic flare and glass flames along them.  This isn't some low class place with carpet with cigarette burns in it: no no.  Upon walking in the door you're greeted with a marble floored lobby with a fiery symbol etched into the floor.  Opulent furniture fills the lobby while sconces burn with orange fiery light.  You haven't quite gone to hell yet, however.  A single hallway leads to the club with a burning pyre symbol at the end and flames along the walls.  It feels like you've been damned as you walk further before the club opens up on either side.  Bright reds, purples, oranges, and other colors fill the place while elegant decor enchants the senses.  Bright silver poles reflect the burning rainbow of lights while scantily clad dancers display their bodies and talents for all to see.  You're truly in a special hell now.%0a---%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
