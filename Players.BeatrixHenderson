I dress to express, presenting myself in a manner so people can perceive that which is truly me."''%0a> %0a> There is an intrinsic sensuality to Beatrix, a beauty more of animalistic magnetism than sophisticated elegance. Her soft, full lips, feminine curves, and long, sylphlike legs add to this carnal allure and even her body language carries seductive undertones; her gait is accompanied by a gentle swaying of her hips; there is a smouldering intensity to her eyes; and the way she tends to briefly lick her lips and play with her hair when meeting new people is decidedly flirtatious. %0a> %0a> Beyond her physical appearance, Beatrix has adopted a visual aesthetic that is distinctively hers; her dyed black-and-red hair, earrings and piercings, and tattoos combine into a look that is easily recognized. Add to this her proclivity towards fetishwear - primarily latex, collars, and corsets - and she has a style made up of equal parts temptation as shock value. Of course, some days better suited for a sweater and jeans, or even the dreaded pantsuit, but those days are nowhere nearly as ''fun''.%0a> [[%3c%3c]]%0a> %25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #9e0b0f' margin-top=0px width=320 margin-right=20px margin-bottom=15px margin-left=7px newwin%25 [[https://i.imgur.com/3yHmf0V.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/3yHmf0V.jpg]]%0a> https://i.imgur.com/1FmYOmf.png%0a> ''"I am the girl your mother warned you of; the girl you pray will go home with you after a wild night at the club; the girl that is o-so-very-irresistible, despite knowing she is not girlfriend material. How about I let you buy me another drink?"''%0a> %0a> Overconfident and self-absorbed, Beatrix seems to think the world revolves around her. She thrives on being at the center of attention and there is not an ounce of false humility or modesty in her — she unapologetically pursuits her wants and needs with a determination that borders on stubborness, consequences be damned. Realizing that nothing in this world comes for free, she has adopted a philosophy of ''quid pro quo''; help, favours, and even affection from her comes with strings attached. %0a> %0a> Beatrix is a sensualist through and through, with a keen affinity for others' desires. Invariably this has lead to accusations of her being a gold digger, slut, sugar babe, or worse. Not that she seems to care overly much about what other people think of her.%0a> [[%3c%3c]]%0a> %25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #9e0b0f' margin-top=0px width=280 margin-right=12px margin-bottom=15px margin-left=20px newwin%25 [[https://i.imgur.com/9KXijuU.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/9KXijuU.jpg]]%0a> https://i.imgur.com/zbDEH0Z.png%0a> ''"All that matters is the here and now, living in the moment, enjoying life to its fullest. What is the point of picking at the old scabs of yesterday when you instead could be savouring all the pleasures that today has to offer?"''%0a> %0a> Christopher. Her younger brother by three years, her brother with special needs — ''very'' special needs. He grew up non-verbal, wheelchair-bound, and with a severe intellectual disability, also requiring frequent trips to the ER. Every day, her parents struggled to make ends meet in the household and Beatrix unfortunately fell by the wayside. Beatrix was not unloved, not at all, but her parents simply did not have enough time or energy to be emotionally present, to give her the attention she needed as a child. And so she rebelled.%0a> %0a> Beatrix's grades began plummeting in middle school, and she was caught drinking alcohol the first time at age twelve. This behaviour escalated in her teens; she started making friends older than herself, partying, getting pierced, and dressing provocatively. Despite her parents' and teachers' best efforts, she grew into a wild and unruly young woman. As soon as she graduated high school, she moved out from her family home.%0a> [[%3c%3c]]%0a> %25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #9e0b0f' margin-top=0px width=300 margin-right=20px margin-bottom=15px margin-left=7px newwin%25  [[https://i.imgur.com/CpU6pXM.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/CpU6pXM.jpg]]%0a> By then, she already had a devoted social media following, often posing online in various latex outfits. What had started as an exercise in escapism, a relief from the stress and chafing at home, eventually developed into a career as a fetish model. Her involvement in the BDSM community became the truest expression of herself, an outlet for the inner turmoil she had felt growing up, allowing her to feel as if she was finally in control of her life.%0a> %0a> And she was, at least until her '''Domitor''' happened upon her. Now she lives a life at the very edge of All Night Society, ignorant of much of Kindred society, yet clearly understanding that both the stakes and rewards of her new station are all that much higher.%0a> %0a> https://i.imgur.com/RTMW9Wt.png%0a> %0a> %25color=#9e0b0f%25'''''Connoisseur of kink (anyone):''''' \\%0a> %25%25Beatrix's fascination with the BDSM scene stems less from hedonistic indulgence than control, the exchange of power, and the visually impressive artistery. She spends much of her free time modelling, planning events, or just attending clubs, socializing with those of similar interests. Body modifications, specifically tattoos and piercings, are also of a particular interest to her.%0a> [[%3c%3c]]%0a> %25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #9e0b0f' margin-top=10px width=300 margin-right=20px margin-bottom=15px margin-left=7px newwin%25 [[https://i.imgur.com/pqhGAaW.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/pqhGAaW.jpg]]%0a> %25color=#9e0b0f%25'''''Not exactly an entrepreneur (anyone):''''' \\%0a> %25%25 Beatrix and a couple of other enthusiasts decided to open up a ''Decadance Miami'', night club where only fetishwear is allowed. It did not take long before it became apparent that they were running the place at a staggering deficit. Out of the initial partners only Beatrix remains, and she is in dire need help from people with actual business acumen.%0a> %0a> %25color=#9e0b0f%25'''''Caught between worlds (vampire):''''' \\%0a> %25%25 Barely having dipped her toes into the world of Kindred society, Beatrix maintains her daily life while fulfilling the duties that fall on ghouls. Some of the vampires of Miami has been pointed out to her, and she seems eager to learn the social rules and the decorum in place in the ''Danse Macabre''. Sooner or later, she is bound to start testing their limits.%0a> %0a> %25color=#9e0b0f%25'''''An eye for the strange (supernatural):''''' \\%0a> %25%25 The realization that things exist that are not-quite-human is both intensenly exciting and frightening all at the same time. Beatrix can not help to wonder if there is some truth to the urban myths that circulate in Miami; if vampires are real, why not demons, or aliens, or werewolves? She has been paying closer attention to reports of all things unusual.%0a> [[%3c%3c]]%0a> %25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #9e0b0f' margin-top=0px width=275 margin-right=12px margin-bottom=15px margin-left=20px newwin%25 [[https://i.imgur.com/bwQi9F7.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/mEpeV7x.jpg]]%0a> https://i.imgur.com/IJjdAnE.png%0a> ''"First meetings are so woefully predictable and boring — trite pleasantries, shallow gossip, small-talk about the weather.

I dress to express, presenting myself in a manner so people can perceive that which is truly me."''%0a%3c %0a%3c There is an intrinsic sensuality to Beatrix, a beauty more of animalistic magnetism than sophisticated elegance. Her soft, full lips, feminine curves, and long, sylphlike legs add to this carnal allure and even her body language carries seductive undertones; her gait is accompanied by a gentle swaying of her hips; there is a smouldering intensity to her eyes; and the way she tends to briefly lick her lips and play with her hair when meeting new people is decidedly flirtatious. %0a%3c %0a%3c Beyond her physical appearance, Beatrix has adopted a visual aesthetic that is distinctively hers; her dyed black-and-red hair, earrings and piercings, and tattoos combine into a look that is easily recognized. Add to this her proclivity towards fetishwear - primarily latex, collars, and corsets - and she has a style made up of equal parts temptation as shock value. Of course, some days better suited for a sweater and jeans, or even the dreaded pantsuit, but those days are nowhere nearly as ''fun''.%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #9e0b0f' margin-top=0px width=320 margin-right=20px margin-bottom=15px margin-left=7px newwin%25 [[https://i.imgur.com/3yHmf0V.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/3yHmf0V.jpg]]%0a%3c https://i.imgur.com/1FmYOmf.png%0a%3c ''"I am the girl your mother warned you of; the girl you pray will go home with you after a wild night at the club; the girl that is o-so-very-irresistible, despite knowing she is not girlfriend material. How about I let you buy me another drink?"''%0a%3c %0a%3c Overconfident and self-absorbed, Beatrix seems to think the world revolves around her. She thrives on being at the center of attention and there is not an ounce of false humility or modesty in her — she unapologetically pursuits her wants and needs with a determination that borders on stubborness, consequences be damned. Realizing that nothing in this world comes for free, she has adopted a philosophy of ''quid pro quo''; help, favours, and even affection from her comes with strings attached. %0a%3c %0a%3c Beatrix is a sensualist through and through, with a keen affinity for others' desires. Invariably this has lead to accusations of her being a gold digger, slut, sugar babe, or worse. Not that she seems to care overly much about what other people think of her.%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #9e0b0f' margin-top=0px width=280 margin-right=12px margin-bottom=15px margin-left=20px newwin%25 [[https://i.imgur.com/9KXijuU.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/9KXijuU.jpg]]%0a%3c https://i.imgur.com/zbDEH0Z.png%0a%3c ''"All that matters is the here and now, living in the moment, enjoying life to its fullest. What is the point of picking at the old scabs of yesterday when you instead could be savouring all the pleasures that today has to offer?"''%0a%3c %0a%3c Christopher. Her younger brother by three years, her brother with special needs — ''very'' special needs. He grew up non-verbal, wheelchair-bound, and with a severe intellectual disability, also requiring frequent trips to the ER. Every day, her parents struggled to make ends meet in the household and Beatrix unfortunately fell by the wayside. Beatrix was not unloved, not at all, but her parents simply did not have enough time or energy to be emotionally present, to give her the attention she needed as a child. And so she rebelled.%0a%3c %0a%3c Beatrix's grades began plummeting in middle school, and she was caught drinking alcohol the first time at age twelve. This behaviour escalated in her teens; she started making friends older than herself, partying, getting pierced, and dressing provocatively. Despite her parents' and teachers' best efforts, she grew into a wild and unruly young woman. As soon as she graduated high school, she moved out from her family home.%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #9e0b0f' margin-top=0px width=300 margin-right=20px margin-bottom=15px margin-left=7px newwin%25  [[https://i.imgur.com/CpU6pXM.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/CpU6pXM.jpg]]%0a%3c By then, she already had a devoted social media following, often posing online in various latex outfits. What had started as an exercise in escapism, a relief from the stress and chafing at home, eventually developed into a career as a fetish model. Her involvement in the BDSM community became the truest expression of herself, an outlet for the inner turmoil she had felt growing up, allowing her to feel as if she was finally in control of her life.%0a%3c %0a%3c And she was, at least until her '''Domitor''' happened upon her. Now she lives a life at the very edge of All Night Society, ignorant of much of Kindred society, yet clearly understanding that both the stakes and rewards of her new station are all that much higher.%0a%3c %0a%3c https://i.imgur.com/RTMW9Wt.png%0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#9e0b0f%25'''''Connoisseur of kink (anyone):''''' \\%0a%3c %25%25Beatrix's fascination with the BDSM scene stems less from hedonistic indulgence than control, the exchange of power, and the visually impressive artistery. She spends much of her free time modelling, planning events, or just attending clubs, socializing with those of similar interests. Body modifications, specifically tattoos and piercings, are also of a particular interest to her.%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #9e0b0f' margin-top=10px width=300 margin-right=20px margin-bottom=15px margin-left=7px newwin%25 [[https://i.imgur.com/pqhGAaW.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/pqhGAaW.jpg]]%0a%3c %25color=#9e0b0f%25'''''Not exactly an entrepreneur (anyone):''''' \\%0a%3c %25%25 Beatrix and a couple of other enthusiasts decided to open up a ''Decadance Miami'', night club where only fetishwear is allowed. It did not take long before it became apparent that they were running the place at a staggering deficit. Out of the initial partners only Beatrix remains, and she is in dire need help from people with actual business acumen.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#9e0b0f%25'''''Caught between worlds (vampire):''''' \\%0a%3c %25%25 Barely having dipped her toes into the world of Kindred society, Beatrix maintains her daily life while fulfilling the duties that fall on ghouls. Some of the vampires of Miami has been pointed out to her, and she seems eager to learn the social rules and the decorum in place in the ''Danse Macabre''. Sooner or later, she is bound to start testing their limits.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25color=#9e0b0f%25'''''An eye for the strange (supernatural):''''' \\%0a%3c %25%25 The realization that things exist that are not-quite-human is both intensenly exciting and frightening all at the same time. Beatrix can not help to wonder if there is some truth to the urban myths that circulate in Miami; if vampires are real, why not demons, or aliens, or werewolves? She has been paying closer attention to reports of all things unusual.%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #9e0b0f' margin-top=0px width=275 margin-right=12px margin-bottom=15px margin-left=20px newwin%25 [[https://i.imgur.com/bwQi9F7.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/mEpeV7x.jpg]]%0a%3c https://i.imgur.com/IJjdAnE.png%0a%3c ''"First meetings are so woefully predictable and boring — trite pleasantries, shallow gossip, small-talk about the weather.
