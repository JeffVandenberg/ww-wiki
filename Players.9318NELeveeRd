A white L shape couch takes up the open and airy living room.  There is a stone wall fireplace with a dual-sided long gas fireplace.  There is a high definition flat screen TV hanging directly above it.   A circular wooden coffee table with little glass accent pieces help warm the area.  The couch is comfortable, the kind you can just fall into.%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #F4AAFF' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=25px margin-right=25px width=225px height=225px%25[[https://i.imgur.com/4WxTfQr.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/4WxTfQr.jpg]]%0aArtwork decorates the space, two pictures frame the pass-through between the living room and kitchen space.  There is a grand piano that sits in the corner past the couch.  Windows all around it let the light from the outside in to illuminate the space.  Two chairs take up the other corner, also surrounded by windows.  A perfect place for a cup of coffee in the morning, just watching the world outside.%0a%0a|| %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/Zg6Dg4P.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/Zg6Dg4P.jpg]] || %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/4WxTfQr.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/4WxTfQr.jpg]] || %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/3WZqLhU.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/3WZqLhU.jpg]] || %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/oJDekS2.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/oJDekS2.jpg]] ||%0a%0a!!! %25center%25%25color=#F4AAFF%25''Hearth & Study''%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #F4AAFF' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=25px margin-right=25px width=225px height=225px%25[[https://i.imgur.com/7azJEXv.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/7azJEXv.jpg]]%0aOn the other side of the stone fireplace, it a cozy little hearth area, two comfortable leather, and metal chairs face the gas fireplace.  There is a round patterned ottoman that's shared between the two of them.  A small round wooden table between the chairs for books.  Siobhan uses the space to read and relax.  Shelves flank the fireplace, filled with mementos from Siobhan's father Alexander.  Favorite pieces of artwork and a picture of the two of them.  A white woven rug warms up the wooden floors. To get to Siobhan's bedroom you have to pass through the hearth room%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #F4AAFF' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=25px margin-right=25px width=225px height=225px%25[[https://i.imgur.com/J3zjUSd.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/J3zjUSd.jpg]]%0aSiobhan's office, a leftover space that her father used often, is light and airy like the rest of the home.  A wood and gold desk takes up the room along with a comfortable white chair.  Behind are more shelves with more art collected around the world and some family photos of Siobahn with her parents Holly and Alexander.  Glass barn sliding door opens into the hearth room, another glass door opens into the foyer.%0a%0a|| %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/J3zjUSd.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/J3zjUSd.jpg]] || %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/vNMHMv9.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/vNMHMv9.jpg]] || %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/7azJEXv.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/7azJEXv.jpg]] || %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/UznnNjC.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/UznnNjC.jpg]] ||%0a%0a!!! %25center%25%25color=#F4AAFF%25''Kitchen, Dinning Room & Bar''%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #F4AAFF' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=25px margin-right=25px width=225px height=225px%25[[https://i.imgur.com/DypXeLJ.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/DypXeLJ.jpg]]%0aThe kitchen has been remodeled, high-end appliances have been placed throughout the kitchen.  A large gas range and oven in the center, with a griddle for pancakes.  The large sub-zero fridge has had the doors replaced over to match the white cabinets throughout the kitchen.  Granite counter tops, with an island & sink in the middle, six barstools for people to relax and talk while Siobhan or Matthias is cooking.

The chairs are all white and padded for comfort.  The dining room opens out to the back patio seating area.  It is surrounded on two sides by glass windows and doors letting the natural light in, or in the summer a light gentle breeze at night.  By the front of the house in the same room is the small bar area.  There is a little refrigerator and a sink.  Above holds the different glasses, and bottles of alcohol.  On the wall is a glass enclosed wine cellar, holding bottles of wine on so they appeared to be floating.  On the otherside of the wine cellar wall is a walk in pantry for the kitchen. %0a%0a|| %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/TCSJSUJ.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/TCSJSUJ.jpg]] || %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/peu3hZf.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/peu3hZf.jpg]] || %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/gBP8TPi.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/gBP8TPi.jpg]] || %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/DypXeLJ.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/DypXeLJ.jpg]] || %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/SUYnXBy.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/SUYnXBy.jpg]] || %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/fKgVbOS.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/fKgVbOS.jpg]] || %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/X8gWVag.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/X8gWVag.jpg]] ||%0a%0a!!! %25center%25%25color=#F4AAFF%25''Master Bedroom & Bath''%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #F4AAFF' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=25px margin-right=25px width=225px height=225px%25[[https://i.imgur.com/kWE3YQg.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/kWE3YQg.jpg]]%0aThe Masterbed room, has a large picturesque window that looks out over the backyard.  Heavy blackout curtains hang on a bar above the window.  There is a lovely chandelier that helps illuminate the room.  The bed is a massive California king, with thousand thread count sheets.  The bed frame is dark mahogany wood that keeps the bed from shifting too much.  Soft grey carpeting warms the room as well.  There is a matching dark mahogany dresser and round bedside tables on either side of the bed.  The closet is a walk in, with a moveable ladder to get to the higher shelves.  There is a section for each type of clothing, all perfectly organized and kept neat and tidy. %0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #F4AAFF' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=25px margin-right=25px width=225px height=225px%25[[https://i.imgur.com/TbV0rsM.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/TbV0rsM.jpg]]%0aThe master bathroom takes up the other side from the closet.

There is a large round freestanding tub in front of the large window.  On the left is the enclosed toilet, and on the right is the shower.

A small metal ladder leads up to what was once Siobhan's castle, growing up she spent many hours playing in it.

There is another L shaped comfortable couch done in gray with yellow accent pillows.  With a flat screen on the other wall, a build in dresser under holds games and DVDs.  A small metal ladder leads up to what was once Siobhan's castle, growing up she spent many hours playing in it.  It's since been repainted and holds a yoga mat, along with a little waterfall fountain.  %0a%3c %0a---%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

The door is painted a dark grey color and is kept locked at all times.  Siobhan typically only goes in there to clean or work.  She rarely lets non-clients inside of its threshold.  Across from the playroom is a large open space that stretches under the laundry, bar and back covered patio.  There is a staircase that leads up into the garage.  %0a---%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
