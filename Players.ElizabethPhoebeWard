Description%0a%0aElizabeth Ward is an average-looking woman of unremarkable height and boyish build, typically dressed in stereotypical Portland hipster fashion. Her most noticeable feature is her short mane of brightly colored hair, anything from deep purple to bright cotton candy pink being fair game. Aside from her hair, Liz often unintentionally accessorizes her look with various bits of fur or feathers, a side effect of her work at the animal shelter she runs in town. She also has a pet barn owl named Archimedes that she will take with her wherever she can.%0a%0ahttps://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4534/26607985089_a328b25199_b.jpg%0a%0aPhoebe is a new mage in the strict sense, but a life surrounded by the supernal seems to have left its mark on the woman. The shaman has a hint of a wild look about her, but this tends to be offset by her easygoing nature and ready smile for everyone she meets. %0a%0ahttps://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4661/24904403677_d8395c9d82_b.jpg%0a%0a!!Nimbus%0a%25rfloat margin-left=20px margin-bottom=20px%25https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4574/38382118151_15487b0839_o.gif%0a'''Long Term'''\\%0aSpirits of flight and freedom begin to gather in the Shadow of the affected area.

Description%0a%3c %0a%3c Elizabeth Ward is an average-looking woman of unremarkable height and boyish build, typically dressed in stereotypical Portland hipster fashion. Her most noticeable feature is her short mane of brightly colored hair, anything from deep purple to bright cotton candy pink being fair game. Aside from her hair, Liz often unintentionally accessorizes her look with various bits of fur or feathers, a side effect of her work at the animal shelter she runs in town.  %0a%3c %0a%3c https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4534/26607985089_a328b25199_b.jpg%0a%3c %0a%3c Phoebe is a new mage in the strict sense, but a life surrounded by the supernal seems to have left its mark on the woman. The shaman has a hint of a wild look about her, but this tends to be offset by her easygoing nature and ready smile for everyone she meets. %0a%3c %0a%3c https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4661/24904403677_d8395c9d82_b.jpg%0a%3c %0a%3c !!Nimbus%0a%3c %25rfloat margin-left=20px margin-bottom=20px%25https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4574/38382118151_15487b0839_o.gif%0a%3c '''Long Term'''\\%0a%3c Spirits of flight and freedom begin to gather in the Shadow of the affected area.
