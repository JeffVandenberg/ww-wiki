Her complexion is exceptionally pale, with wide-spaced, unusually large silver eyes, very angular features and only a hint of blush in her cheeks. She generally wears her hair loose, and generally dresses in a casual manner. Her body moves with a quiet grace. Her mannerisms are friendly, and she is never too busy or serious to smile.%0a%0a!!%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/43PwwGG.png%0a%0aFrankie has returned to Portland after spending some years away. She can often be found at OHSU, working long shifts, or simply in the company of her sister Charlie or other friends. At present, she's up for any new hobby that may suit her fancy, but professes she loves figure skating above all things. When she's not working, she's either at the Arena or trying to climb a waterfall.%0a%0a----%0a%0a%0a(:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a(:table:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/ldH4udT.png%0a||! %25color=#ffd700%25Image ||! %25color=#ffd700%25Name ||! %25color=#ffd700%25Relationship ||! %25color=#ffd700%25Coment ||! %25color=#ffd700%25Ringtone ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/GefLX5N.jpg || %25color=#ffd700%25[[Camila Lobo| Camila]] || %25color=#ffd700%25Relationship Here || %25white%25 You are virtue, bravery, intelligence and everything that is good and right about the world.
