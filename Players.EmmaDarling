Crazy Hope spent long periods of time in Torpor with short spurts where she'd be active for a decade before slumbering again. Completely reclusive, she almost never left her creepy old mansion. Ghouls were used to hunt for her.  Just before her most recent Torpor, she embraced her loyal Ghoul. As her Sire didn't belong to any Covenant, Emma has an uphill battle to find a home in one.%0a%0a!!!!%25vampire%25 ''Budding Lab Assistant (Ordo Dracul, Scientists, Occultists):''%0aEmma has taken the first steps to carving out a better place in vampire society.
