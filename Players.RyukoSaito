There's a rich, almost unending energy that radiates from her and only occasionally does it smolder down. To most she has pale skin, rich espresso hair, and vibrant hazel eyes that betray her mixed heritage. She'll almost always be seen wearing some type of gloves: her favorite being a black velvet pair with a single button on each wrist.''%0a%0a %0a''In terms of fashion she likes to wear kawaii type fashion. She favors skirts, tall socks, leggings, sweaters, t-shirts with cute logos and more. She also has a varied wardrobe for her work outfits: everything from sweet and sexy outfits to submissive leather. She has a few gothic or punk outfits also but this part of her wardrobe is growing now that she&rsquo;s met so many who enjoy the culture. Recently she&rsquo;s become interested in lolita fashion.''%0a%0a%0ahttps://i.imgur.com/3PZAQpM.png %25center%25%0a%0a''Her fellow changelings and those touched by the fae see her quite differently. Her long hair is vibrant pink fire that shifts into orange flickers of flame at the tips: eventually fading away like mist similar to a lithium or strontium fire. Her once hazel eyes are now vibrant pink and magenta. Her skin is just as pale but filled with the subtle light of smoldering embers just beneath which influences her natural scent to be something akin to burning exotic woods. Swirling, non symmetrical flame like symbols mark her body in various places and each seems to be filled with a complex array of symbols: arcadian lettering. There's an otherworldly strangeness to her in the way she walks, talks, and even in her appearance: the aspects of the others. Most obviously this manifests in her longer pointed ears and her chaotic personality: a fiery elf from another world.''%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=right border='2px solid #008000' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=450px height=500px%25 https://i.imgur.com/SqbjYGH.png%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=left border='2px solid #008000' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=450px height=500px%25 https://i.imgur.com/HSSPoxF.png%0a%0a%0ahttps://i.imgur.com/Kg6xzkc.png %25center%25%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #008000' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=450px height=500px%25 https://i.imgur.com/lM9yrQR.png%0a%0a* '''The Dancer''' - She managed to get a job as an erotic dancer at a local club called The Special Hell.

She carried out her Queen's law, claimed what her Queen wanted, found new playthings, or helped the huntsman do their dark deeds.  Maybe you've seen her when she was a warden?  Her noble upbringing shows still though, her posture is perfect, she eats delicately, and the way she moves is graceful.%0a* '''The New Queen''' - Her royal baring is impossible to deny.  Everything from bold confidence to her proper stride and her strict manners.  She has a number of fae knights that attend to her wishes even.

Feel free to ask for a boost.%0a*  '''Vainglory''':She can bend the mask to reveal her true form but without most of the side effects. Mortal can't hurt her like this. The mind can be changed so easily this way.%0a*  '''Pathfinder''':Once she used this to help her bring stolen or escaped people back to arcadia.

We've had our ups and downs. I've seen her pain, her joy, her love. She's seen mine. I was once asked if I like girls. No, I don';t like girls. No, I don't like women.

Never better words were found for Ryuko. So many times in my short life in portland she has been a light in the darkness. When I was hurt, sick, scared, alone, and exploring a world foreign to me. We&rsquo;ve had our ups and downs. I&rsquo;ve seen her pain, her joy, her love. She&rsquo;s seen mine. I was once asked if I like girls. No, I don&rsquo;t like girls. No, I don&rsquo;t like women. I like who I like because they have earned my heart.

There's a rich, almost unending energy that radiates from her and only occasionally does it smolder down. To most she has pale skin, rich espresso hair, and vibrant hazel eyes that betray her mixed heritage. She'll almost always be seen wearing some type of gloves: her favorite being a black velvet pair with a single button on each wrist.''%0a%3c %0a%3c  %0a%3c ''In terms of fashion she likes to wear kawaii type fashion. She favors skirts, tall socks, leggings, sweaters, t-shirts with cute logos and more. She also has a varied wardrobe for her work outfits: everything from sweet and sexy outfits to submissive leather. She has a few gothic or punk outfits also but this part of her wardrobe is growing now that she&rsquo;s met so many who enjoy the culture. Recently she&rsquo;s become interested in lolita fashion.''%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a46,52c40,41%0a%3c ''Her fellow changelings and those touched by the fae see her quite differently. Her long hair is vibrant pink fire that shifts into orange flickers of flame at the tips: eventually fading away like mist similar to a lithium or strontium fire. Her once hazel eyes are now vibrant pink and magenta. Her skin is just as pale but filled with the subtle light of smoldering embers just beneath which influences her natural scent to be something akin to burning exotic woods. Swirling, non symmetrical flame like symbols mark her body in various places such as her side, thighs, arms, and under one eye. In the center of her chest, embedded in her sternum, is a large pink gem that glows softly with light at times. There's an otherworldly strangeness to her in the way she walks, talks, or even looks: the aspects of the others. Most obviously this manifests in her pointed ears and her chaotic personality.''%0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=right border='2px solid #008000' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=450px height=500px%25 https://i.imgur.com/SqbjYGH.png%0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=left border='2px solid #008000' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=450px height=500px%25 https://i.imgur.com/HSSPoxF.png%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> ----%0a> %0a55,56d43%0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #008000' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=450px height=500px%25 https://i.imgur.com/lM9yrQR.png%0a%3c %0a67c54,55%0a%3c %0a---%0a> ----%0a> %0a70c58,59%0a%3c %0a---%0a> ----%0a> %0a110c99,100%0a%3c %0a---%0a> ----%0a> %0a123a114%0a> [$:Image] = "{(rand 1 2)}"%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a

She still is very new to supernatural life.  She&rsquo;s learned much but still it&rsquo;s only a drop in an ocean of new information.%0a%3c * '''The Dancer''' - She managed to get a job as an erotic dancer at a local club called The Special Hell. It’s fun work and the money is good.  She works there quite a bit providing for her and her sister.%0a%3c * '''The Helles Belle''' - She's the newest member of the infamous band and ready to carry on their legacy one monster summon at a time.  She'll sing and play on her amazing fiery guitar with all her heart and fury.%0a%3c * '''The Immigrant''' - Ryuko, along with her twin, are 3rd generation japanese-americans who greatly enjoy and value their heritage.%0a%3c * '''Grand Warden of the Eldritch Forest''' - In that life she left behind she was nobility, second only to the Queen of that cursed place.  She carried out her Queen's law, claimed what her Queen wanted, found new playthings, or helped the huntsman do their dark deeds.  Maybe you've seen her when she was a warden?  Her noble upbringing shows still though, her posture is perfect, she eats delicately, and the way she moves is graceful.%0a%3c * '''The Herald''' - Ryuko is an adept of the Heralds of the Void.  Perhaps you&rsquo;re part of them or interested in joining?%0a%3c * '''The Sweet Spell''' - Ryuko is the proud owner of [[Portland's only Maid Cafe]].  Odd for someone who can't cook at all.%0a%3c * '''The Emissary to the Kindred''' - Once, she was exiled from the freehold.  Now, she's the emissary of the Lost to the Kindred community.  Her connections to both groups run deep.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> *This is a hook.%0a> *This is a hook on drugs.%0a> *Don't let your hooks do drugs.%0a
