Science, numbers, hard facts, this is what she believes in and how she interprets her Magical fate. Gloria is adaptable, and often does best when she has to think on the fly. She lives on the straight and narrow for the most part. She isn’t shy but there isn’t any level of Girls Gone Wild in this middle-aged mathematics professor. She stands at 5’7 and usually wears business casual attire, though if you catch her on an off day you might find her in jeans and a t-shirt. .\\%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=17px margin-right=16px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=8px width=315 newwin%25https://i.pinimg.com/564x/ff/dc/51/ffdc511656c95798bea21be927653513.jpg\\%0a%0a!%25mage%25 The Mage%0a%0aWhere Gloria is adaptable and logical - Dichotomy is Reckless and free-spirited. Magic flows through her veins and intertwines within her soul. She is a strong believer in the occult and in something she calls 'The Tree of Everything'. She loves to talk about all manner of subjects. When she isn't doing her Mage thing, you can often find her working in places she doesn't actually work at - just happy to help out and meet new people. Her wardrobe varies widely - one day she’s wearing jeans and a tank top, the next day she looks like she’s ready to make flower circlets and sing ‘Kumbaya’.\\%0a%0a%0a!%25mage%25 History:\\%0a%0aGloria was born and raised in France, where she did her schooling to become a teacher of Mathematics. When she was 25, she moved to the United States with her husband and started teaching.  By the age of 30 she was divorced and Awakened. Now Gloria's in Portland to attempt putting down roots again and Dichotomy wants to meet some more Mages.%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=17px margin-right=16px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=8px width=315 newwin%25https://i.pinimg.com/564x/0a/3f/d5/0a3fd57eea345cdd64a003ab0c90c40e.jpg%0a%0a!%25mage%25 Rumors\\%0a%0a*She touched a wheel and it broke?%0a%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a!%25mage%25  Hooks:%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=17px margin-right=16px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=8px width=315 newwin%25https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/druidic-yggdrasil-tree-round-dark-gothic-logo-ancient-book-style-88101476.jpg\\%0a%0a%0a%25mage%25 '''Nameless''' (Mage) - %25white%25 Dichotomy has GoV leanings, but she has yet to make a commitment to any Order.
