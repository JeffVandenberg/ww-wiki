Calista has the taut muscles of someone who is active, with a healthy soft beige skin tone, witness to the out-doors, she is clearly in good kilter. She has long dirty-blonde hair, equally describable as light brown, and clear blue eyes flecked with green. Calista would look comically young for her evident prominent status that her stance and attire suggests. It would perhaps be so if not for the confidence she displayed, exuding a maturity her youthful face denies. She is foreign, no mistake, her accent being a tell, though she speaks English fluently, the accent present and obvious, her English is understandable and indicative of someone who has resided in the States for a long time. For those unaccustomed to a Greek accent she might almost sound as if she speaks English with a Spanish accent. Her use of 's' often comes out as 'sh', she drops an 'h' here or there, she rolls her 'r' now and then, and she can't quite seem to pronounce 'uh' sounds, so 'cut' sounds like 'cat'. Her voice is furthermore contralto, smoky, deep; her demeanor confident and astute, not wont to waste time. Something about her person seems almost unfriendly, even behind a smile, it's not sincere, the expression feels perhaps calculating.%0a%0aHer typical attire is in the realm of professional, with tight black slacks, light sweaters favoring darker colors, blouses of the same line, heels which announce her arrival with a clip, and so on. She keeps a leather executive business bag slung across her person at all times. Obviously important things are in there.%0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a(:table table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 bgcolor=#0d0d0d:)%0a(:cell width=400:)%25newwin%25[[https://i.imgur.com/aSDETb4.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/aSDETb4.jpg]]%25%25%0a(:cell width=330:)%25newwin%25[[https://i.imgur.com/7MslMGe.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/7MslMGe.jpg]]%25%25%0a(:cell width=400:)%25newwin%25[[https://i.imgur.com/3lwhi3m.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/3lwhi3m.jpg]]%25%25%0a(:cell width=280:)%25newwin%25[[https://i.imgur.com/3nmASSJ.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/3nmASSJ.jpg]]%25%25%0a(:tableend:)%0a%0a(:table table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 bgcolor=#0d0d0d:)%0a(:cell width=360:)%25newwin%25[[https://i.imgur.com/oxfT83t.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/oxfT83t.jpg]]%25%25%0a(:cell width=390:)%25newwin%25[[https://i.imgur.com/p32JDN0.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/p32JDN0.jpg]]%25%25%0a(:cell width=330:)%25newwin%25[[https://i.imgur.com/PxQXryO.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/PxQXryO.jpg]]%25%25%0a(:cell width=330:)%25newwin%25[[https://i.imgur.com/GwEA7Zg.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/GwEA7Zg.jpg]]%25%25%0a(:tableend:)%0a%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Contacts'''%0a%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/DXJnKiI.jpg || %25mortal%25Emma Darling || %25mortal%25House Maid || %25mortal%25A worker who enjoys their work is invaluable|| %25newwin%25[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1k_RK6KCVM|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Hooks'''%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/jHluzx2.png%0a%0a!!!!%25bgcolor=black mortal%25 ''Kyklos (Cults, Supernatural, Highlife, Lowlife)'': %0aCalista is a member of the Circle; FHC, LLC. Those inside the circle know what to know, those outside... this becomes more of a sketchy image. The Greek has shown up at an array of functions - banquets among the high class, abandoned harbor gatherings by the low class, mundane and abnormal functions, she shows up just about anywhere. Probably just for fun...%0a%0a!!!!%25bgcolor=black mortal%25 ''Epicheírisi (Everyone, Business-folk)'': %0aCalista is the Director of Digital Data Management Development for Tuttle and Oni Development Corporation (TODCO), a property development company. It is a convoluted title within a Byzantine structure of a company that is itself within more layers and layers. She knows many Miamians in the business world, be it real-estate or banking, or what have you.%0a%0a!!!!%25bgcolor=black mortal%25 ''Pezoporía (Everyone)'': %0aCalista is not only an active member of the Miami Outdoor Adventure Club (MOAC) but also acts as an occasional guide and trainer. Hiking and overnighting in the wilderness is a popular pastime for her and, if not an acquaintance within MOAC, you have perhaps met on any of the trails across the United States, from Cascades to Everglades, or even beyond the Americas, to Mount Fuji or the Carpathians.%0a%0a!!!!%25bgcolor=black mortal%25 ''Nostrádamos (Everyone)'': %0aCalista is somewhat obsessed with Astrology. If you're an astrologer, run a shop, consigner of related goods, then you've likely met the young Greek woman before and perhaps read her cards or chart.%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/OP3uY6J.png%0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a(:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a%0a(:cellnr width=100%25:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Quotes'''%0a%0a%25mortal%25 "I am a quote!
