Other creatures of its species shun it, because they fear its fate. The prey, in turn, seeks only to find a safe place, hide, and wait until dawn. Around it, people close their windows, turn up the volume on their televisions, and ignore the howls.%0a%0a%25center%25 '''ISOLATED Condition''':  Your character has been split from his crew, drawn and called out, cornered and quartered.

Greek heritage shows in sun-kissed skin and a scruff of a beard. Chocolate brown eyes seem to be constantly narrowed from time spent outside but he can soften his expression and put on a million dollar smile in the blink of an eye. Short black hair is always styled with a purpose right down the part that's cut into his scalp. His left arm is a collage of tattoos and his right bears a large Polynesian tattoo at the shoulder, he earned from an elderly woman on a trip to Maui.  %0a%0a%25center%25%25white%25 '''Gauru:''' Christian's War-form stands just under nine feet but belies an incredible level of strength for it's size. Eyes burn with a yellowish-amber and his coat is a dark charcoal grey with splashes of lighter greys and whites around the neck, shoulders and hind legs. Claws are shorter than the talons of other wolves but are thicker and more powerful than they appear.%0a%0a%25center%25%25white%25 '''Urhan:''' Short and stocky, the wolf is colored like his war-form with powerful shoulders and short, strong legs. He's not the fastest but he will run down his prey with sheer stamina. Eyes blaze amber and seem to peer into the very soul when locked on their prey, bringing all the sins and guilt to the surface. %0a%0a----%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=5px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=250px height=350px%25https://i.imgur.com/3Pz0wfQ.png%0a!%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/T8pSDf3.png%0a%25center%25%25werewolf%25 '''Four Walls and a Roof (Everyone)''': Christian has recently inherited his father's real estate business and moved it from Seattle to Portland and is working on establishing himself in Portland's various rejuvenation projects.%0a%0a%25center%25%25werewolf%25 '''From Ibiza to Tokyo (Everyone)''': He's still struggling to shed his old party boy image.

Only Fate, however knows the truth of what awaits this young wolf...Tragedy or Glory.%0a%0a%25center%25%25werewolf%25 '''LOST and Found (Changelings/Embassy)''': Christian has recently been appointed the emissary to the Lost from the Uratha, but he maintains an open door policy for all the Others in the city.

Greek heritage shows in sun-kissed skin and a scruff of a beard. Chocolate brown eyes seem to be constantly narrowed from time spent outside but he can soften his expression and put on a million dollar smile in the blink of an eye. Short black hair is always styled with a purpose right down the part that's cut into his scalp. His left arm is a collage of tattoos and his right bears a large Polynesian tattoo at the shoulder, he earned from an elderly woman on a trip to Maui.  %0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25%25white%25 '''Gauru:''' Christian's War-form stands just under nine feet but belies an incredible level of strength for it's size. Eyes burn with a yellowish-amber and his coat is a dark charcoal grey with splashes of lighter greys and whites around the neck, shoulders and hind legs. Claws are shorter than the talons of other wolves but are thicker and more powerful than they appear.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25%25white%25 '''Urhan:''' Short and stocky, the wolf is colored like his war-form with powerful shoulders and short, strong legs. He's not the fastest but he will run down his prey with sheer stamina. Eyes blaze amber and seem to peer into the very soul when locked on their prey, bringing all the sins and guilt to the surface. %0a%3c %0a---%0a> %25center%25%25white%25%0a> %0a> %25center%25%25white%25%0a> %0a> %25center%25%25white%25%0a> %0a89,96d81%0a%3c %25center%25%25werewolf%25 '''Four Walls and a Roof (Everyone)''': Christian has recently inherited his father's real estate business and moved it from Seattle to Portland and is working on establishing himself in Portland's various rejuvenation projects.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25%25werewolf%25 '''From Lisbon to Tokyo (Everyone)''': He's still struggling to shed his old party boy image.
