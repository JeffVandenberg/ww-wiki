'''+Appearance+'''%0a-----%0aDr. Frank’s gaze is piercing, as if she’s looking into the soul. She studies people as if everyone is some sort of science project, including friends, acquaintances and strangers. She can be quite charming and friendly. However, when she’s observing it can make her seem a tad creepy. Her common style tends towards classic Oxford blouses or ladies’ dress shirts, pencil skirts, high heels and the occasional tie. At the Mental Hospital, she adds a white lab coat. When dressing casual, Frau Doktor wears jeans and Cthulhu or horror movie t-shirts. Victoria speaks with the hint of a German accent.%0a\\\%0a%0a!! '''+RP Hooks+'''%0a-----%0a'''The Doctor:''' Dr. Frank is a Psychiatrist at the Bradley Hospital, an Asylum. Naturally she only works nights.

The Acolyte reveres a host of cthonic entities, but her chief deity is Byatis the Serpent Bearded, a Great Old One associated with divination.%0a%0a'''Horror Nerd:''' Dr. Frank is an dedicated fan of the horror genre. She’s an avid reader as well as a fervent movie goer. Her favorite authors include: H.P. Lovecraft, Clarke Ashton Smith, and Clive Barker. The films that she’s most fond of are the original Universal Monster Movies. But she enjoys horror movies of all kinds, including more modern takes on the genre.%0a\\\%0a%0a!! '''+History+'''%0aDr. Frank is the only known childe of the missing Mekhet Dragon, Dr. Lovecraft. Frau Doktor was confined to the Bradley Hospital as a teenager, believed to be schizophrenic. Dr. Lovecraft saw the truth in the young woman’s visions. He groomed her as a protege, and had her released from the asylum. He put her through medical school and after a period of time assisting him at the asylum, Victoria earned the Embrace. Lovecraft has vanished though and he never got to initiate his childe into the Ordo Dracul. This had left her Unaligned and with no political power to muster. Recently she’s joined the Circle of the Crone.%0a\\\%0a%0a%0a!! '''+Quotes+'''%0a----%0a“That is not dead which can eternal lie. And with strange aeons even death may die.” - H.P. Lovecraft%0a%0a“Fun times to be had with the mad doctor. I think I have a thing for these Shadows, they’re likable.” - Kobi%0a%0a“Now you know what it is that I see when I close my eyes, what drove me to see you when we first met. How does it feel when the doktor becomes the patient?” Agatha Apocalypse%0a%0a“I don’t think you’re going to be able to treat anything but my addictions. Good thing I’m okay with that. Better isn’t always what’s best. Sometimes it’s good to be a little sick, and I love that you keep that in your life. You are one fucked-up shrink. Stay pretty!” Lauren Hearst%0a%0a“Everyone talks about the doctor. Well doctors I hate. I talk of the friend, Victoria, I adore her.” Ana%0a%0a“*Deep, cackling Laughter*” Twoee Four%0a%0a“A fascination for the forces of heaven to match my own. To the crackle of lightning, we’ll unveil the lies.” Ms Discord%0a%0a“She’s the shadow that calls my name and I love answering her. She’s a temptress, brilliant doctor, and great friend. I’m so glad to know frau doktor.” - Ryuko Saito%0a%0a“I am not quite sure what it is about Dr. Frank, but she is another that seems to have a way of bringing out the part of me that enjoys a good time. I have a very small circle of friends, but I believe I can count her among them.” - Esme%0a\\\%0ahttps://i.imgur.com/z0jbQHP.jpg%0ahttps://i.imgur.com/dGbrx8b.jpg%0ahttps://i.imgur.com/sGcdUIP.jpg%0a

'''+Appearance+'''%0a%3c -----%0a%3c Dr. Frank’s gaze is piercing, as if she’s looking into the soul. She studies people as if everyone is some sort of science project, including friends, acquaintances and strangers. She can be quite charming and friendly. However, when she’s observing it can make her seem a tad creepy. Her common style tends towards classic Oxford blouses or ladies’ dress shirts, pencil skirts, high heels and occasionally a tie. At the Mental Hospital, she adds a white lab coat. When dressing casual, Frau Doktor wears jeans and Cthulhu or horror movie t-shirts. Victoria speaks with the hint of a German accent.%0a%3c %0a%3c !! '''+RP Hooks+'''%0a%3c -----%0a%3c The Doctor: Dr. Frank is a Psychiatrist at the Bradley Hospital, an Asylum. Naturally she only works nights. Patients there nicknamed her Dr. Frankenstein because of her use of electroconvulsive therapy.%0a%3c %0a%3c Mad Science: The Doctor also considers herself a scientist, with research and experiments into behavior, emotions, personality, and the human mind in general. She’s also very interested in the study of psychic phenomena.%0a%3c %0a%3c Miskatonic University Alumni: Frau Doktor is a “disciple” of the collected works of H.P. Lovecraft and believes that there were some real truths hidden in his fiction. Her sire seems to have put this idea in her head. He was so influenced by the Cthulhu Mythos, that he even took his name as an homage to the writer, calling himself Dr. Lovecraft.%0a%3c %0a%3c Forbidden Knowledge: Frankie has recently joined the Circle of the Crone and it’s whispered that she has the power of Divination and Dream Visions. The Acolyte reveres a host of cthonic entities, but her chief deity is Byatis the Serpent Bearded, a Great Old One associated with divination.%0a%3c %0a%3c Horror Nerd: Dr. Frank is an dedicated fan of the horror genre. She’s an avid reader as well as a fervent movie goer. Her favorite authors include: H.P. Lovecraft, Clarke Ashton Smith, and Clive Barker. The films that she’s most fond of are the original Universal Monster Movies. But she enjoys horror movies of all kinds, including more modern takes on the genre.%0a%3c %0a%3c !! '''+History+'''%0a%3c Dr. Frank is the only known childe of the missing Mekhet Dragon, Dr. Lovecraft. Frau Doktor was confined to the Bradley Hospital as a teenager, believed to be schizophrenic. Dr. Lovecraft saw the truth in the young woman’s visions. He groomed her as a protege, and had her released from the asylum. He put her through medical school and after a period of time assisting him at the asylum, Victoria earned the Embrace. Lovecraft has vanished though and he never got to initiate his childe into the Ordo Dracul. This had left her Unaligned and with no political power to muster. Recently she’s joined the Circle of the Crone.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !! '''+Quotes+'''%0a%3c ----%0a%3c -%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
