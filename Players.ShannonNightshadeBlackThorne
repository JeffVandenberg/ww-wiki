The Woman%0aShannon stands at a compact 5’0”, but appears smaller due to her tendency to dress in tops one size too large. She favors more casual clothing, usually t-shirts, hoodies, flannels, jeans and sneakers. Usually she is dressed for comfort or utility over style. Makeup rarely if ever touches her face, although when it does she cleans up nicely. She’s had a variety of hairstyles, but currently her hair is a mane of shoulder-length dusty brown. Light green eyes are constantly scanning her surroundings, as well as sizing up the people around her. %0a%0aHer daily personal effects include her wedding band, a thinner version of the one her husband Ethan wears, as well as a large but lightweight long knife, another gift from her mate that Shannon lovingly refers to as her ‘engagement knife’. %0a%0ahttps://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4520/24001899767_398cf67fe1_b.jpg%0a%25lfloat width=500px%25https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4300/35907651722_bd1cab3946.jpg%0a%25rfloat width=405px%25https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/764/31677243323_bbc64b0f94.jpg%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a!!! The Wolf%0aThe irraka normally only takes this form when on tracking detail or while hunting in the Shadow. When the situation calls for it, she appears as a slight, wiry-looking black wolf.

She favors more casual clothing, usually t-shirts, hoodies, flannels, jeans and sneakers. Usually she is dressed for comfort or utility over style. Makeup rarely if ever touches her face, although when it does she cleans up nicely. She’s had a variety of hairstyles, but currently her hair is a mane of shoulder-length dusty brown. Light green eyes are constantly scanning her surroundings, as well as sizing up the people around her. %0a%3c %0a%3c Her daily personal effects include her wedding band, a thinner version of the one her husband Ethan wears, as well as a large but lightweight long knife, another gift from her mate that Shannon lovingly refers to as her ‘engagement knife’. %0a%3c %0a%3c https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4520/24001899767_398cf67fe1_b.jpg%0a%3c %0a%3c !!
