He is slightly harrier than the average man, but not much. He typically wears suits or other fashionable clothing. His build is lean, and his arms are slightly longer than someone his height. %0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25bgcolor=black changeling%25''Mien''%0a%0a%25center%25Tony is best described as a Florida Skunk Ape, or a Sasquatch/Bigfoot.  He's covered in hair from head to toe, with only his ape-like face, pads of his feet, and pads of his hand without fur, revealing his gray-black skin. Even when he stands in the shadows, he seems darker than dark in coloration. %0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25bgcolor=black changeling%25''Mantle''%0a%0a%25center%25Winter touches upon him very subtly. The air is a touch cooler and the silence is extra quiet and reflective. %0a(:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 bgcolor=#0d0d0d:)%0a(:cellnr width=100%25 bgcolor=#0d0d0d:)%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/pmKpiUt.jpg || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/AhInrjU.jpg || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/wa54Duj.jpg || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/H0qTPyI.jpg || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/kRYBA7u.jpg || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/D3ZpxwF.jpg%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/yk4qqDG.png %0a(:tableend:)%0a(:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 bgcolor=#0d0d0d:)%0a(:cellnr width=100%25 bgcolor=#0d0d0d:)%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/CGqKis7.png || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/S1XQbRO.png || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/gLUjxhi.png || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/tAMf0VP.png || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/fLKJcdt.png || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/qkHns40.png%0a(:tableend:)%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25bgcolor=black changeling%25'''Contacts'''%0a!!!%25bgcolor=black mortal%25[[The Bad Guys]]%0a||! %25mortal%25%25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/CpLuuYX.jpg ||! %25mortal%25[[Andy Romanyszyn]] ||! %25mortal%25Bad Guy's Brawler and Bartender ||! %25mortal%25She's still adjusting to the Wyrd, but she's good people and throws fists well ||! %25newwin%25[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhlPAj38rHc&ab_channel=aceblade45|%25mortal%25Rocky]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/cmLC2gV.jpg || %25mortal%25[[AtticusAJJohnson|Atticus -AJ- Johnson]] || %25mortal%25Bad Guy's Hammer for Nails || %25mortal%25One part biker, one part John Henry, and one part Jolly Green Giant || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25TBD]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/G9O5An9.png || %25mortal%25[[Liam Thatcher]] || %25mortal%25Bad Guys' Boss and Friend || %25mortal%25A man of fine taste in guns, music, and women || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25TBD]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/e6XD60k.jpg || %25mortal%25[[Noah Petrov]] || %25mortal%25Bad Guys' Second Boss, Friend, and Sloane's Beau || %25mortal%25Don't get between his barrel and his target, unless you want to die. || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25TBD]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/vTt4LQn.png || %25mortal%25[[Siobhan Hayes]] || %25mortal%25First Friend and Bad Guys' Money || %25mortal%25She's my first friend in Miami, and someone I care for deeply.
