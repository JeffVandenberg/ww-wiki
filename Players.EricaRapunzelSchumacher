Her build is slim, more natural rather than athletic, with a height of five feet six inches. Her long blonde hair, natural color, is in a braid or a bun usually. Well groomed, precise application, nose pierced, just fashionable enough to not be overbearing or status-flaunting, made-up modestly, pleasingly composed. She has a mastery of herself and her appearance. She seems like a very pleasant person, so what seems so off? What is brimming beneath? Her eye contact lingered perhaps too long?

She has a delicate voice, cultured and summery. Her build is slim, natural rather than athletic, with a roundly average height of five feet six inches. Her long blonde hair, natural color, is in a braid or a bun. Well groomed, precise application, nose pierced, just fashionable enough to not be overbearing or status-flaunting, made-up modestly, pleasingly composed. She has a mastery of herself and her appearance. She seems like a very pleasant person, so what seems so off? What is brimming beneath? Her eye contact lingered perhaps too long?

Her presence has only graced the city for seven months or so - to the chagrin of her students. Amongst the Awakened she is largely unknown so far: a nice woman with a ready smile, but one who hasn't divulged all that much information. She seems to gravitate towards books and some have picked up, not surprisingly, on that interest. Those outside of Awakened circles have possibly crossed her path when she was jogging, or perhaps visiting a local cafe - most often seen, giving a smile, but little more before passing on.
