Similarly, the Hotel staff make certain that former guests who are no longer welcome are announced to other guests.%0a%0aBut those who agree to the terms of peace afforded by the Embassy Hotel can find themselves a safe place to rest and meet with others. The staff are often unseen and are excessively discreet when it comes to private matters. And although the Faction Leaders throughout the City may or may not get along on any particular day, all have been bound to an agreement to protect the Neutral Grounds.%0a%0a''Long-term Guests who wish to stay longer than 3 months will dedicate 1 dot of Resources per month and must receive permission from The Ambassadors. (Submit an Action Request)''%0a%0aEmbassy Wards:%0a%0a*ALL supernatural powers of any sort have a &#8722;5 penalty to their dice pool on Embassy grounds.%0a*Stealth powers, or powers used with the intent of harming the target directly or indirectly additionally face the following restrictions:%0a*Affected powers that do not have a roll result in the character being shunted from the warded portion of the Embassy one turn after they enter with the power, or activate it..%0a*Affected powers and hostile mundane actions that do have a roll result in the character being shunted immediately after the action takes effect.%0a----%0a!!!Embassy Seals%0a%0aOver the course of the Embassy’s existence, it’s become clear that to help prevent disputes and inform others of territorial claims, as well as to provide information about locations in general without needing to send messages out to the various leaderships, a system would need to be put in place to allow individuals knowledgeable of the Embassy to recognize these claims and messages at a glance, without requiring some sort of database or constant message passing.%0a%0aAs a combination of the techniques used by the individual factions before the War of Four, the Ambassadors and those affiliated with them have come together and created what are called “Embassy Seals”, which act as an at-a-glance marking system at the edges of various buildings, locations, and areas to allow those in the know to discern who it belongs to, if it’s safe to enter, and whatever other information those who control the area (or simply oversee it) may wish to pass on to others. They’re often a combination of simple symbols, miscellaneous markings (claw scratches, for instance), or perhaps even little attached trinkets or forms of decoration.%0a%0aIn general, these are short messages, generally dictating who controls the area (Vampires, Werewolves, the Embassy), and if it’s meant to be solely for them or if it’s ‘Neutral Ground’, that is, open to anyone who follows the Embassy’s rules and those of the owner. Some other general ‘status’ markings have been developed recently, such as ‘Danger’ (meaning the location is a risk for anyone, but not necessarily barred), ‘Safe’ (meaning those within are usually willing to provide shelter or ‘sanctuary’ to those that ask), and similar descriptors.%0a%0aOf course, individual Factions have found ways to personalize their symbols a bit, to make it recognizable as belonging to a smaller group within the faction, but with the general Faction still recognizable to anyone else. For instance, many Werewolves will add a first tongue sigil into the design, representing the Tribe or Pack that controls the area specifically, whereas anyone else can still recognize it as being Werewolf controlled.%0a%0aTo note, use of this system is not required, in the case of those preferring to keep their holdings secret, but any misunderstandings caused by that must be lived with by the owner.%0a%0a!!!Systems%0a%0aFor the most part, Seals are recognizable to anyone affiliated with or at least abiding by the Embassy without any rolls. Recognizing a sigil belonging to another faction as representing a sub-group may require a Wits + Politics, Streetwise, or Occult roll, in which case it’s recognizable as either belonging to a sub-faction (or pack-equivalent, or lineage, etc), or to those that have experience with them, it’s recognizable as that specific group.%0a%0aLocation wikis should list the Embassy Seals, if any, that can be found in the area, and who can automatically recognize them (that is, those that don’t need a roll). A few examples off how one might appear on a location page appear below:%0a%0a'''Embassy Seals'''%0aVampire Territory (All), Circle of the Crone Territory (Vampires)%0a%0a'''Embassy Seals'''%0aEmbassy-Controlled (All), Neutral Ground (All), Safe (All)%0a%0a'''Embassy Seals'''%0aNeutral Ground (All), Changeling-Owned (All), Owned by the Storm Knights (Changeling)%0a%0a!!Embassy Wards%0a*ALL supernatural powers of any sort have a &#8722;5 penalty to their dice pool on Embassy grounds.%0a*Stealth powers, or powers used with the intent of harming the target directly or indirectly additionally face the following restrictions:%0a*Affected powers that do not have a roll result in the character being shunted from the warded portion of the *Embassy one turn after they enter with the power, or activate it..%0a*Affected powers and hostile mundane actions that do have a roll result in the character being shunted immediately after the action takes effect.%0a*‘''CLASH OF WILLS''’: Powers altering/weakening/harming the Embassy itself, whether physically, temporally, spatially, spiritually, fate-wise, or similar, or otherwise altering the flow of time, space, destiny, and similar within it will cause a Clash of Wills with the wards and needs a staff member present (or simply fails).%0a----%0a!!Faction Specific Wings in the Embassy%0a%0a!!!Changeling%0a*Nathaniel Bordeaux Wing%0a%0a!!!Mage%0a*Jamie Fairchilde Wing%0a*Arrow War Room%0a%0a!!!Mortal+%0a*Dr. Eric Miller Wing%0a%0a!!!Vampires%0a*Alexandria D’Ambrosio Wing%0a%0a!!!Werewolf%0a*Michael Westbay Wing%0a----%0a!!The Accord%0a%0aOn this day, January 21st, 1979 A.D., we the representatives of the five factions, being Awakened, Kindred, Lost, Forsaken, and those Mortals who know of our existence, do hereby agree to the following terms of peace within the city of Portland:%0a%0aThe Masquerade, Veil, and other termed secrecies of the combined factions will be considered paramount, and shall not be violated. Should a breach of any of these secrecies occur, it is the requirement of each faction to help end the threat to the combined people, for if one of our secrets falls, surely all shall.%0a%0aWhile there may be political maneuvering between members of each faction, or the possibility of violence between individuals, it is the will of the Assembled that those of each involved faction deal with their members as appropriate to the situation. Those that repeatedly are punished in such a way may be considered enemies of the state, and dealt with b either Trial or Challenge, detailed later in this document. Acts taken against this Accord by a Faction shall be met by the combined might of the other Factions.%0a%0aWar comes at too great a cost. As such, war shall never come to pass again between our collective peoples without a true and known threat against the safety of the city by one or more factions within the city. While we do agree to police our own, we do agree that repeated offenses shall be dealt with by a tribunal assembled of each faction’s representatives, by which the accused may choose from the following options: Trial: The accused may request a trial, by which he may choose one person to represent him, and one person shall be chosen to act against them. The trial will be by evidence and debate, with a single member of each faction standing as a panel of judges and the jury, deciding the fate of the discussion and evidence. A majority is required for either a guilty or innocent verdict, and upon finding guilt, the four not from the accused’s faction will decide the punishment, which may be up to and including banishment or death.%0a%0aChallenge: The accused may instead decide to challenge one of the faction’s Ambassadorial members. Which will give that Ambassador the choice of what the challenge shall be. The length of the challenge may not be anything that takes longer than a week to accomplish. If the accused successfully completes the challenge, they will have the charges against them dismissed. Should they fail, they will suffer the judgement of the others, as if he had been found guilty of a trial. The Ambassadors not involved in the challenge will act as fairness judges during the challenge to make certain that the rules of the challenge will be followed in both word and spirit.%0a%0aWe, the signatories below, do hereby ratify this Accord on behalf of our respective leaders, in the Vitae of the Reverend Prince himself, bound by the Wyrd, guided by Fate, before an Elodoth of the Forsaken, and at the Word of the Rose City Guild.%0a%0aSignatories:%0a%0aIn the name of the Alpha Pack,%0a''Michael Westbay, Thrice-Born Representative''%0a''Zhang Fan, Zhang family Representative''%0a''Annette D’Ambrosio, D’Ambrosio Representative''%0a%0aRepresenting the Sanctified Court of Portland,%0a''Sophia Corpas, Kindred Ambassador''%0a''Feng Shi Le, Kindred Ambassador''%0a%0aRepresenting the Three Pillars Hold,%0a''Black Beak, Changeling Ambassador''%0a''Ms. Natasha, Changeling Ambassador''%0a%0aRepresenting the Awakened of Portland,%0a''-Dante-, Consillium Ambassador''%0a''-Slide-, Free Council Ambassador''%0a''-Revocs-, Seer of the Throne Ambassador''%0a%0aRepresenting the Rose City Guild,%0a''Eric Miller, Mortal Ambassador''%0a''Jennie Lewis, Mortal Ambassador''

The staff are often unseen and are excessively discreet when it comes to private matters. And although the Faction Leaders throughout the City may or may not get along on any particular day, all have been bound to an agreement to protect the Neutral Grounds.%0a%3c %0a%3c ''Long-term Guests who wish to stay longer than 3 months will dedicate 1 dot of Resources per month and must receive permission from The Ambassadors.

They’re often a combination of simple symbols, miscellaneous markings (claw scratches, for instance), or perhaps even little attached trinkets or forms of decoration.%0a%3c %0a%3c In general, these are short messages, generally dictating who controls the area (Vampires, Werewolves, the Embassy), and if it’s meant to be solely for them or if it’s ‘Neutral Ground’, that is, open to anyone who follows the Embassy’s rules and those of the owner. Some other general ‘status’ markings have been developed recently, such as ‘Danger’ (meaning the location is a risk for anyone, but not necessarily barred), ‘Safe’ (meaning those within are usually willing to provide shelter or ‘sanctuary’ to those that ask), and similar descriptors.%0a%3c %0a%3c Of course, individual Factions have found ways to personalize their symbols a bit, to make it recognizable as belonging to a smaller group within the faction, but with the general Faction still recognizable to anyone else. For instance, many Werewolves will add a first tongue sigil into the design, representing the Tribe or Pack that controls the area specifically, whereas anyone else can still recognize it as being Werewolf controlled.%0a%3c %0a%3c To note, use of this system is not required, in the case of those preferring to keep their holdings secret, but any misunderstandings caused by that must be lived with by the owner.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Systems%0a%3c %0a%3c For the most part, Seals are recognizable to anyone affiliated with or at least abiding by the Embassy without any rolls. Recognizing a sigil belonging to another faction as representing a sub-group may require a Wits + Politics, Streetwise, or Occult roll, in which case it’s recognizable as either belonging to a sub-faction (or pack-equivalent, or lineage, etc), or to those that have experience with them, it’s recognizable as that specific group.%0a%3c %0a%3c Location wikis should list the Embassy Seals, if any, that can be found in the area, and who can automatically recognize them (that is, those that don’t need a roll).

Should a breach of any of these secrecies occur, it is the requirement of each faction to help end the threat to the combined people, for if one of our secrets falls, surely all shall.%0a%3c %0a%3c While there may be political maneuvering between members of each faction, or the possibility of violence between individuals, it is the will of the Assembled that those of each involved faction deal with their members as appropriate to the situation. Those that repeatedly are punished in such a way may be considered enemies of the state, and dealt with b either Trial or Challenge, detailed later in this document. Acts taken against this Accord by a Faction shall be met by the combined might of the other Factions.%0a%3c %0a%3c War comes at too great a cost. As such, war shall never come to pass again between our collective peoples without a true and known threat against the safety of the city by one or more factions within the city. While we do agree to police our own, we do agree that repeated offenses shall be dealt with by a tribunal assembled of each faction’s representatives, by which the accused may choose from the following options: Trial: The accused may request a trial, by which he may choose one person to represent him, and one person shall be chosen to act against them. The trial will be by evidence and debate, with a single member of each faction standing as a panel of judges and the jury, deciding the fate of the discussion and evidence. A majority is required for either a guilty or innocent verdict, and upon finding guilt, the four not from the accused’s faction will decide the punishment, which may be up to and including banishment or death.%0a%3c %0a%3c Challenge: The accused may instead decide to challenge one of the faction’s Ambassadorial members. Which will give that Ambassador the choice of what the challenge shall be. The length of the challenge may not be anything that takes longer than a week to accomplish. If the accused successfully completes the challenge, they will have the charges against them dismissed. Should they fail, they will suffer the judgement of the others, as if he had been found guilty of a trial. The Ambassadors not involved in the challenge will act as fairness judges during the challenge to make certain that the rules of the challenge will be followed in both word and spirit.%0a%3c %0a%3c We, the signatories below, do hereby ratify this Accord on behalf of our respective leaders, in the Vitae of the Reverend Prince himself, bound by the Wyrd, guided by Fate, before an Elodoth of the Forsaken, and at the Word of the Rose City Guild.%0a%3c %0a%3c Signatories:%0a%3c %0a%3c In the name of the Alpha Pack,%0a%3c ''Michael Westbay, Thrice-Born Representative''%0a%3c ''Zhang Fan, Zhang family Representative''%0a%3c ''Annette D’Ambrosio, D’Ambrosio Representative''%0a%3c %0a%3c Representing the Sanctified Court of Portland,%0a%3c ''Sophia Corpas, Kindred Ambassador''%0a%3c ''Feng Shi Le, Kindred Ambassador''%0a%3c %0a%3c Representing the Three Pillars Hold,%0a%3c ''Black Beak, Changeling Ambassador''%0a%3c ''Ms. Natasha, Changeling Ambassador''%0a%3c %0a%3c Representing the Awakened of Portland,%0a%3c ''-Dante-, Consillium Ambassador''%0a%3c ''-Slide-, Free Council Ambassador''%0a%3c ''-Revocs-, Seer of the Throne Ambassador''%0a%3c %0a%3c Representing the Rose City Guild,%0a%3c ''Eric Miller, Mortal Ambassador''%0a%3c ''Jennie Lewis, Mortal Ambassador''%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
