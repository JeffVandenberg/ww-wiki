A cheery woman, on all accounts, but her handshakes are chilly at times, and she always seems to sneak up when one isn't quite paying attention. Quiet by practice and eloquent with her words, she's easy to smile and an incorrigible flirt. She's often seen with the wealthy and famous, either jauntily pacing clubs at night or laughing in dark corners with bright friends, she never appeared incongruous. She is a shadow and shadowless, enigmatic in occupation, quick to lose in a crowd. She so adores the brunches and dinners she's invited to and is modest in her portions, though no one has ever seen her turn down wine, liquor, or spirits. Truly, a joy to be around, rarely seen alone. A professor, some say, moonlighting classes. A professional, others muse, though of what they are not certain.

A cheery woman, on all accounts, but her handshakes are chilly at times, and she always seems to sneak up when one isn't quite paying attention. Quiet by practice and eloquent with her words, she's easy to smile and an incorrigible flirt. She's often seen with the wealthy and famous, either jauntily pacing clubs at night or laughing in dark corners with bright friends, she never appeared incongruous. She is a shadow and shadowless, enigmatic in occupation, quick to lose in a crowd. She so adores the brunches and dinners she's invited to and is modest in her portions, though no one has ever seen her turn down wine, liquor, or spirits. Truly, a joy to be around, rarely seen alone. A professor, some say, moonlighting classes. A professional, others muse, though of what they are not certain. Maybe she works at that library around the corner. More a listener than a teller, which must mean something, right? She talks of herself little, but it's all too easy to get lost in discussing one's own life with her.%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c (:div2end:)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Contacts'''%0a%3c %0a%3c ||! %25mortal%25Image ||! %25mortal%25Name ||! %25mortal%25Relationship ||! %25mortal%25Comment ||! %25mortal%25Ringtone ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c %0a%3c (:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Hooks'''%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25mortal%25 ''Hook 1(Who it effects)'': %0a%3c Hook info here%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25mortal%25 ''Hook 2(Who it effects)'': %0a%3c Hook info here%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25mortal%25 ''Hook 3(Who it effects)'': %0a%3c Hook info here%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c (:div2end:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:cellnr width=100%25:)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Quotes'''%0a%3c %0a%3c %25mortal%25 "I am a quote!
