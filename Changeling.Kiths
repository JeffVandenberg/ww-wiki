That tree was easier to climb than it looked. No, no. Don’t you try to go up there, OK?“''\\%0a\\%0aKingdoms of glittering ice built on immense clouds. Balconies carved into the face of a towering mountain. Mansions with stilts that disappear into the fog unfathomable miles below. The changelings that become airtouched are as varied as the lofty realms in which they spent their durance. Floating, flying, or gliding was the only method of travel possible, and so their Keepers changed them. Some had wings grafted to their flesh, some rode lightning bolts as steeds, and some were made lighter than air, carried by the wind itself. \\%0a\\%0a''Beast:'' Round, unblinking eyes, a sweeping crest of wind ruffled feathers, and fingers that end in hooked talons. \\%0a''Fairest:'' Footfalls that barely touch the ground, gently rustling clothes, and a mass of swirling white hair.    \\%0a''Ogre:'' Thick slabs of muscle, skin that glows sunset red, and a cone of roiling smoke in place of legs. \\%0a\\%0a'''Kith Blessing:''' When rolling Athletics to jump, climb, or otherwise move vertically, three successes counts as an exceptional success.\\%0a''Featherfall:'' By spending a point of Glamour, any damage caused by a fall of less than terminal velocity can be negated for the rest of the scene, and the distance moved by climbing or jumping is doubled.\\%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a%0a-----%0a!!!%25center%25Blightbent %0a''“Paramedic said your lungs would look like fried scrapple if you hadn’t gotten your mask on. Me? Nah I’m fine. You’d be surprised how long I can hold my breath.”'' \\%0a\\%0aNot all the realms of Arcadia are untouched, primeval wilderness. Whether a twisted reflection  of urban landscapes or corrupted from the bile of their Fae owner, some are polluted hell-scapes of sulfuric clouds, corrosive sludge, and contaminated soil. Blightbents are those changelings who survived in these conditions, breathing foul air and eating poisonous food, forced to become lesser versions of their tainted masters. \\%0a\\%0a''Darkling:'' A soot stained waistcoat, sizzling footsteps, and a stovepipe hat that occasionally belches smoke. \\%0a''Elemental:'' Pitted chunks of concrete and globs of asphalt strung together with rusted re-bar. \\%0a''Wizened:'' Skin like slick yellow plastic, a mouth like a Gigeresque respirator, and nictitating membranes.  \\%0a\\%0a'''Kith Blessing:''' Any Athletics roll made to hold their breath or avoid fatigue counts as an exceptional success on three successes instead of five.\\%0a''Smog:'' Spend a point of Glamour to produce a cloud of caustic smog with a radius in meters equal to your character’s Stamina for the scene, inflicting the moderate poisoned tilt on everyone that remains inside it; you’re immune to your own smog, of course, and in fact may use that smog to displace and avoid other airborne toxins.\\%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a%0a-----%0a!!!%25center%25Chirurgeon %0a''“Senora, I won't take your money. This is a free clinic and I do this work for myself as much as for your daughter and my other patients. I have done things I am ashamed of and I work here to help repay others for the ill that I once did.”'' \\%0a\\%0aSome Gentry create a chirurgeon to heal injured Gentry or changelings, but others create one so that he can in turn transform ordinary mortals into changelings or to alter changelings that his Keeper wishes to remake. \\%0a\\%0a''Beast:'' A disturbing creature with the eyes, mandibles and many jointed arms like a praying mantis. All of these insectile parts closely resemble surgical tools. \\%0a''Darkling:'' He has a round body with long limbs ending in many long fingers and toes, all of which have many scars. Each of his fingers ends in a different surgical tool made from fingernail or bone. \\%0a''Fairest:'' Portions of her skin is covered in decorative scars that resemble tattoos and her long silver fingernails conceal surgical instruments that retract like a cat's claws. \\%0a\\%0a'''Kith Blessing:''' When performing all forms of Medicine on patients, a chirurgeon gets an exceptional success on three successes instead of five. \\%0a''Intensive Care:'' Daily visits by a chirurgeon downgrade wounds in exactly the same manner as intensive care treatment. If he spends a Glamour (per day) when rolling to treat a patient, an additional wound can be downgraded each day with enough successes. \\%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a-----%0a%0a!!!%25center%25Coldscale%0a''“This indoor orchid garden is my favorite room and I hold all of my meetings here. Yes, it's expensive to keep all of these plants, but the deal we are talking about helps pay those bills. If you give the security contract to my firm, we'll make absolutely certain that your neighborhood is protected from all threats, even ones you might never suspect or perhaps even believe.”'' \\%0a\\%0aKeepers dwelling in realms where reptiles were the norm or in hot dry realms where only the  toughest inhabitants could survive created most coldscales. By their nature, a coldscale is somewhat distant and if she feels strong emotions, she rarely express them. Before her Durance, a coldscale was usually an outsider, not as much because people rejected her, but because she choose to keep her distance from others. \\%0a\\%0a''Darkling:'' A serpent-like creature colored so that it is easily overlooked, but disturbing to look upon. \\%0a''Elemental:'' A reptilian figure carved from living jade. \\%0a''Fairest:'' A sleek and elegant reptilian humanoid, with small attractively patterned scales. \\%0a''Ogre:'' Resembling a gila monster with large crocodile-like scutes, this creature appears exceptionally tough. \\%0a\\%0a'''Kith Blessing:''' When rolling Subterfuge to hide an intention to attack or otherwise act in a hostile manner, or to read another’s intention for the same, a Coldscale achieves an exceptional success on three successes instead of five. \\%0a''Reptilian Metabolism:'' The Coldscale can reflexively spend a point of Glamour to automatically succeed on a roll for resisting hunger, thirst, poison, heat, or lack of air; this can be done after failing the roll normally, but not after a dramatic failure.\\%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a-----%0a%0a!!!%25center%25Curator%0a''“This dagger was made in Persia in the early 14th  century, I believe it was made in Tabriz and the blade is meteoric iron. It was also used to murder another of our kind 11 days ago.” '' %0a%0aSome people have a natural affinity for museums and history; many seek to make a career of this, others have their vocation forced upon them by the Gentry. Like most of her kind, the curator was created to care for her Keeper's collections. She was charged with knowing the location of every item, fetching it for her Keeper, and often explaining it to them.  %0a%0a''Beast:'' With large eyes, slender dexterous paws, short grey fur, and long whiskers, this changeling has a rat-like appearance. \\%0a''Elemental:'' She appears to be a living statue made from antique ivory and polished brass. \\%0a''Wizened:'' His eyes have built in jeweler's loups and his hands contain precise clockwork gears. He is a melding of centuries old technology and grey, slightly dusty flesh. %0a%0a'''Kith Blessing:''' When using Academics to research or to put together a repository (per crafting rules), three successes counts as an exceptional success. \\%0a''Psychometry:'' By placing their hand on a book or ancient artifact, rolling Intelligence + Academics, and spending a point of Glamour, a curator can gain the Informed condition about any subject related to that book or object.%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a-----%0a%0a!!!%25center%25Dancer %0a''“I’ll make sure everyone’s eyes are on me. They always are, of course, but I mean more than usual this time.”'' \\%0a\\%0aThere is an undeniable beauty inherent in all motion. The Lost who became dancers know this, though like everything in Fairies, that knowledge was paid for in ways best forgotten. Some  performed on stages of red-hot bronze or while wearing shoes of jagged crystal for their Keeper’s entertainment. Others served in palaces made of glittering knives, their agility necessary to carry out even basic actions.\\%0a\\%0a''Beast:'' Long legs ending in three talented toes, an impossibly thin neck, and a fluttering train of emerald and sapphire feathers. \\%0a''Elemental:'' A frantically cavorting pillar of fire, a sinuously undulating column of water, a gently swaying tree, all vaguely humanoid. \\%0a''Fairest:'' Lithe, pliable limbs, exaggerated angular features, and flowing, dance-like movements to music only they can hear. \\%0a\\%0a'''Kith Blessing:''' A dancer gains an exceptional success on three successes instead of five for all Athletics and Expression rolls relating to dancing. \\%0a''Mesmerizing Movement:'' By spending a point of Glamour when dancing, and rolling Dexterity + Expression + Wyrd versus onlookers’ Composure + Supernatural Tolerance, the changeling can perform a dance so mesmerizing that it  becomes impossible to look at anyone but them for those that fail to contest the ability; any roll to notice anything else in the area that’s not within the same line of sight automatically fails, so long as the dance continues. This also inflicts the Obsession condition on them relating to the changeling. The effects end early if another power (prompting a Clash of Wills), damage greater than their Stamina, or a blinding effect that lasts a full turn or more is inflicted on the target(s). \\%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a-----%0a!!!%25center%25Draconic %0a''“Get out of this neighborhood! If I see either of you or any of your friends around here or if you try to send the Huntsmen after us, I'll know who to blame. I know who you two are and if anything I don't like happens, I’ll come for you both.”'' \\%0a\\%0aThe Gentry create draconics to inspire fear and awe. These reptilian beasts are destructive  creatures of primal terror. One Keeper who created a draconic might have wished own a wondrously impressive beast, another sought an impressive guard or military commander. Before their Durance, many draconics were interested in power and all of them were filled with confidence. Now, every draconic is terrifying and tough.  \\%0a\\%0a''Beast:'' A horrifying reptilian monster with thick scales and long claws. \\%0a''Elemental:'' A dragon-like elemental beast, most appear to be made from stone, metal, or colored glass. \\%0a''Fairest:'' With his scales and elaborate crest, he is the essence of terrifying beauty. \\%0a''Wizened:'' She is clearly a human who has been remade into a dragon, with human eyes and the forms of human limbs beneath her scales. \\%0a\\%0a'''Kith Blessing:''' When using Intimidation to attempt to appear menacing or to ward a threat away, a Draconic gains an exceptional success on three successes. \\%0a''Scales:'' Immediately upon taking damage, a Draconic may spend a point of Glamour reflexively to toughen their scales, allowing them to transform up to three lethal damage into bashing damage. %0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a-----%0a!!!%25center%25Gameplayer %0a''“That’s the third table I’ve seen her run tonight. I think she might be counting cards, but if she is, the house doesn’t seem to be able to catch her on it. I stopped playing casual games like chess with her a long time ago. After I make my first move, she tells me how the game plays out and she wins. It kind of takes the fun out of it.”'' \\%0a\\%0aFor some True Fae, everything is a game played with pieces made of people’s lives and actions. No matter what type of game the Gentry favors, none enjoy losing, so they spend a great deal of time amusing themselves with games and rules that ensure their victory. A gameplayer was made to either be a part of a particular game, or was forced to play games for her master’s enjoyment, or both. She not only endured the endless hours of being part of a game, but also suffered the ire of her master if he happened to lose a game, even if it was not her fault. \\%0a\\%0a''Elemental:'' He is a wooden or plastic game piece, with a crude humanoid shape. \\%0a''Fairest:'' The changeling is a stone or marble game piece, crafted with the ability to move about on her own. \\%0a''Wizened:'' The character may resemble a card or a deck of cards with legs and arms. \\%0a\\%0a'''Kith Blessing:''' When using Investigation to solve a puzzle, play a strategic game, or apply game theory to another problem, the changeling achieves an exceptional success on three successes. \\%0a''Game Theory:'' Once per scene, by spending a point of Glamour when making another roll, a Gameplayer can replace another Skill in that roll with Investigation, so long as they can somehow apply game theory or logic to the problem. \\%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a-----%0a!!!%25center%25Gravewright %0a''“Yes, this house is definitely haunted. No amount of insulation will fix that cool draft or the noises you hear at night. However, for a small fee, I can solve both your problems and the problems of your unfortunate spectral visitors.”'' \\%0a\\%0aThe Gentry do not understand death, but some of their more disturbing realms have connections to the Underworld. Gentry with an interest in the dead create gravewrights as emissaries to the Underworld. One gravewright may visit the Underworld and stay, perhaps willingly, another might spend his Durance dealing with ghosts and Underworld creatures as well as with the Gentry. \\%0a\\%0a''Darkling:'' A dry and skeletal creature that looks like a body that has been left buried in the sand for years. \\%0a''Fairest:'' With perfect skin bearing a hint of pearl grey color, a complete lack of body heat, and never a hair out of place, he looks like an especially lovely cinematic image of a vampire, lacking only the fangs. \\%0a''Ogre:'' A large creature with skin like well-aged rawhide and a somewhat corpse-like appearance. \\%0a\\%0a'''Kith Blessing:''' When using Occult to notice or study ghostly phenomena or anything involving the Underworld, a Gravewright gains an exceptional success with three successes. \\%0a''Eyes of the Grave:'' By spending a point of Glamour and rolling Wits + Occult as an instant action, the Gravewright can see, hear, touch, and speak to any nearby ghosts in Twilight for the scene, as well as recognize the Anchor, Open, Controlled, Materialized, or Underworld Gate Conditions, and intuit any Key to the latter. \\%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a-----%0a!!!%25center%25Gremlin %0a''“As he turned the key in the ignition, he heard the familiar roar of the car’s engine coming to life. This was followed quickly by the sound of the engine catching, backfiring, and then stalling out, a puff of smoke erupting from the hood.”'' \\%0a\\%0aThe Gremlin is a mischievous dabbler who tends to like pulling mean pranks on others. She is small and seems harmless, which lets her get into a lot of trouble. A Gremlin is created solely for the amusement of her True Fae masters. The changeling served as a court jester and fool, making a mockery of guests and causing them pain and anguish in the name of her master. If she did not perform to whatever standards her master put to her each day, she was tortured until she performed better. Now she can’t help taking advantage of a situation to pull pranks and act out. \\%0a\\%0a''Beast:'' She is an animal normally associated with mischievous behavior, such as a squirrel, weasel, or chimpanzee.  \\%0a''Ogre:'' She’s small and hunched with ugly green skin and warts all over her body. \\%0a''Wizened:'' The changeling is mostly humanoid with long fingers and long ears and big bright eyes. \\%0a\\%0a'''Kith Blessing:''' When making any Crafts roll to sabotage a machine, or cause an object to fail, break down, or otherwise work at less than full efficiency, the Gremlin gets an exceptional success with three successes. \\%0a''Gremlin’s Touch:'' As a Reflexive action, a Gremlin can spend a point of Glamour, touch a machine (complex or otherwise) and roll Wits + Crafts; each success causes one Structure damage that ignores Durability. %0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a-----%0a!!!%25center%25Maker %0a''“I can have this done for you later tonight. If you are willing to wait until tomorrow, I can throw in an object file for making it via 3-d printing. That way, if you ever need another, someone can print you one. I could also get you set up with a 3-d printer of your own – they're really a lot of fun to work with.”'' \\%0a\\%0aThe Gentry can steal and copy, but they cannot create anything truly new or unique. However, many desire new toys and entertainments above all else. They craft humans into makers so these individuals can spend their days creating toys or traps to thwart rivals and ensnare mortals. Other makers spent their Durance maintaining and refashioning their Keeper's existing toys.  \\%0a\\%0a''Darkling:'' This goblin-like changeling has large eyes, long slender arms, and more than a dozen exceedingly long fingers, each of which has four or more joints.  \\%0a''Elemental:'' Made of metal and tempered glass, the changeling appears to be a sculpture with beautiful tools instead of hands, and not a trace of warm, weak flesh.  \\%0a''Fairest:'' This beautifully hairless and exceedingly flexible creature has more than a dozen long four jointed fingers. \\%0a\\%0a'''Kith Blessing:''' On any Crafts rolls to design, build, modify, repair, or understand any sort of device, a Maker gains an exceptional success with three successes. \\%0a''Creation:'' Once per scene, by spending a point of Glamour, a Maker can make a Build Equipment action with a single instant action that takes only one turn, without using “jury rigging” rules. They must otherwise be capable of the action, such as by having materials and tools available, however.   \\%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a-----%0a!!!%25center%25Manikin %0a''“If you think you can sneak past the guards, don't worry about me. Once we get in the storeroom, you set the fire and get out. When the smoke builds up, I'll open the door and flood the place with smoke. Then, I'll get the three captives out in the confusion, while you and Julia wait outside to take care of the loyalists.”'' \\%0a\\%0aKeepers who either enjoyed playing with living dolls or whose realms had no place for living flesh and blood transformed manikins from humans into artificial constructs. A manikin's new form is merely an imitation of humanity, but carries that imitation to a supernatural degree. \\%0a\\%0a''Fairest:'' A creation of metal, jewels, and perfectly crafted joints, this humanoid figure is stunning and elegant. \\%0a''Ogre:'' This terrifying creation is roughly humanoid and exceedingly functional. Within the limits of the humanoid form, little care was taken to make it appear beautiful or even particularly human. \\%0a''Wizened:'' Although no trace of flesh remains, it's clear that this construct of brushed aluminum, colored wires, and advanced circuits was made by replacing portions of a human body one piece at a time. \\%0a\\%0a'''Kith Blessing:''' A Manikin gets three successes instead of five on any Empathy roll to understand a mortal’s behavior. \\%0a''Imitation:'' By spending a point of Glamour, once per scene a Manikin may perfectly duplicate an entirely mundane action performed by another (humanoid) character, to the point of duplicating the number of successes and other results of the check.  %0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a-----%0a!!!%25center%25Nix %0a''“Isn't that the most amazing sunset you've seen in years? Let's go outside to get a better look. There's no one's around, so there won't be a problem if you leave your checkpoint for a minute or two, and the view is so much better out there.”'' \\%0a\\%0aNixes are amphibious creatures created by Gentry who lived in aquatic realms. Most were forced to dwell on small islands or seashores, where their Keepers ordered them to lure intruders to their doom or to trap visitors with riddles or binding promises. Most of their Keepers lived in elaborate underwater splendor which their nixes rarely saw, with the exception of a few nixes that their Keepers used as storytellers. Before their Durance, the majority of nixes were unassuming people who were not obviously charismatic, but were gifted storytellers or sales people. \\%0a\\%0a''Darkling:'' With the eyes and scales of fish and a beak like a squid, this creature appears strange and somewhat menacing. \\%0a''Elemental:'' A vaguely fish-like humanoid made from cloudy, opalescent water. \\%0a''Ogre:'' She has the long sharp teeth of deep-sea fish, as well as patches of scales on her hide.  \\%0a\\%0a'''Kith Blessing:''' A nix gets an exceptional success on three successes for any Athletics roll to hold their breath underwater or swim. \\%0a''Siren:'' Nix are masters of distraction and misleading. By spending a point of Glamour and rolling Manipulation + Persuasion + Wyrd vs a target’s Resolve + Supernatural Tolerance, a Nix can speak to someone and convince them to follow the changeling, leave an area, or otherwise abandon a task for a scene. %0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a-----%0a%0a!!!%25center%25Oracle %0a''“Unless we do something to stop them, a team of Huntsmen will infiltrate the King of the West's ascension ceremony and try to kidnap him. I can find out more later, but that alone should be sufficient to perhaps allow us to prevent this disaster.”'' \\%0a\\%0aOracles are changelings who have become slightly unstuck in time. Their Keepers find humans who are lucky or who have a talent for prophecy and enhance this ability so that the Oracles can provide them with information about the future. Some accompany their Keepers as living warning systems, while other spend their time locked away and only taken out to dispense prophecies to their Keeper and her allies. \\%0a\\%0a''Beast:'' This raven-like creature has large eyes filled with shifting colors. \\%0a''Elemental:'' A creature made from living clockwork, with a clock dial for a face. \\%0a''Wizened:'' He has a third, obviously inhuman or artificial eye in the middle of his forehead. \\%0a\\%0a'''Kith Blessing:''' The character regularly catches glimpses of the next second or two. This provides the benefit of gaining an exceptional success on three successes when using Investigation to search for something hidden. \\%0a''Omen Sight:'' If an Oracle spends a point of Glamour and rolls Wits + Occult, they can look further into the future and can ask yes or no questions (1 per success) about the most likely future of a single person, place, or object known to them, such as whether a murder will occur in a location in the day. The further away the timespan, the less accurate the answers will tend to be. The player can only ask about the future of a single target only once per chapter.%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a-----%0a%0a!!!%25center%25Phantasmagore%0a''“I'd hate you, except you simply aren't worth my trouble. You abducted me, but look at the mess you made when you attempted to transform me. Now your supposedly wondrous magics not only can't force me to come back to Arcadia  with you, they can't even stop me from hitting you.”'' \\%0a\\%0aThese changelings are patchwork creatures. Gentry who attempt to create new kiths by randomly combining portions of existing ones deliberately create some, but most chimeras are created accidentally, when changelings become infused with too much of Arcadia's changeable nature and their bodies alter in an uncontrolled fashion. Every phantasmagore's appearance is different, often radically so. Despite appearing to be partially a member of several kiths, a chimera gains none of the advantages of these kiths, but being a composite creature has its own unique benefits. \\%0a\\%0a''Elemental:'' This entity is formed of three or more unrelated materials, like ruby, ice, and bone. \\%0a''Fairest:'' The changeling's disparate elements all come together to create an attractive and harmonious whole. \\%0a''Wizened:'' At least three different creatures appear to have been grafted together in a scarred Frankenstein-like assembly.  \\%0a\\%0a'''Kith Blessing:''' When rolling Persuasion against the denizens of the hedge or other inhuman realms, three successes counts as an exceptional success instead of five. \\%0a''Inhuman Mind:'' Once per chapter, the Chimera may spend a point of Glamour when targeted by a supernatural effect not caused by a Changeling to invoke a Clash of Wills (roll Wyrd + Wits for them); if this beats the opponent, the effect immediately ends (or stops affecting the changeling, if it had multiple targets).  \\%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a%0a----%0a!!!%25center%25Swimmerskin %0a''“Come into the deeps with me'' \\%0a''Of the river, lake and sea'' \\%0a''Leave your troubles on the shore'' \\%0a''Leave your sail and your oar.”'' \\%0a\\%0aA swimmerskin is the quintessential merfolk of myth: curious, aloof and dangerous. Aquatic Keepers -- and those Gentry interested in seeding their maritime buffets with life -- introduce these changelings to the deep, cold pressures of faerie oceans and expect them to thrive. Predators, alien fishermen, and intelligent, poisonous waters harry these prisoners constantly. The ones that manage to flee generally do so at great personal cost. Too often, the swimmerskin that escapes through the Hedge finds they can no longer walk on land. \\%0a\\%0a''Beast:'' Gnarly-limbed octopods with humanoid torsos and ink-black veins. Broad, sharp-tipped beaks for mouths with human teeth carved from baleen. Legs only functional as elegant fishtails. Gills that undulate when speaking. \\%0a''Elemental:'' Shell-like protrusions at the joints and curly, coral reef tresses. Schools of unidentifiable fish just beneath translucent blue skin. Rows of pale shark teeth. \\%0a''Fairest:'' Exotic, tropic fins and a glittering patina of colorful scales. Unbearably beautiful human faces, untouched by scale. Sea-shell clothing seamlessly adhered to curvaceous, eel-skin bodies. \\%0a''Wizened:'' Ghastly antique diving helmets huge, glass eyes. Brassy shoulder-blade propellers with leathery ligaments stretched across narrow crankshafts. Skin like waxy canvas.  \\%0a\\%0a'''Kith Blessing:''' A swimmerskin gets an exceptional success on three successes for any Athletics roll to swim, dive, perform underwater acrobatics, or otherwise maneuver within or into the water. \\%0a''Amphibious Kiss:'' By spending one Glamour, the swimmerskin can breathe water as easily as air for the scene. For an additional point, by touching a target’s lips, she can impart that ability to another at the same time, and can remove this gift at any time. %0a%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a-----%0a!!!%25center%25Visionary%0a''“I think that’s a fantastic idea. You should definitely make that mix tape. Your day job can wait.”'' \\%0a\\%0aEven the omnipotent True Fae occasionally lose their drive. Their bizarre realms go fallow and their nonsensical labors lie unfinished. Until the changelings that become visionaries provide them with inspiration, drawn out by hot kisses or cold blades if need be. \\%0a\\%0a''Elemental:'' Luminous flesh of coalescent creative potential, stretched like canvas over a frame built from crystallized inspiration. \\%0a''Fairest:'' A body begging to be sculpted, a voice that sparks symphonies, movement meant to be captured in dance, and eyes that bring obsession. \\%0a''Wizened:'' Papery wings that drop curls of parchment, silver-sharp pen nib fingertips, and a smoky breath that reeks of genius. \\%0a\\%0a'''Kith Blessing:''' When using Persuasion to Social Maneuver someone in a way that benefits one of their Aspirations, a visionary gains an exceptional success on three successes instead of five. \\%0a''Follow Your Dreams:'' Spend a Glamour and roll Presence + Wyrd, with the subject’s Resolve as a penalty if they are resistant to the idea of following their passion. If successful, the subject gains the Obsessed Condition related to an Aspiration of the subject’s choice. On an Exceptional success, the visionary not only knows the subject’s Aspirations, but chooses which the target obsesses on. %0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a-----%0a!!!%25center%25Witchtooth %0a''“Young man, if you don't stop trying to break into that shop, you will soon regret your actions…”  \\%0a“My, isn't that a loud alarm…”  \\%0a“Officer, the young man ran, or rather stumbled that way, I doubt you'll have much trouble catching him.”''  \\%0a\\%0aGentry seeking to create a witchtooth typically find people who are filled with anger at the injustice of their lives and an interest in the occult. Most of these Gentry use the changeling as a tool against their rivals. Other Gentry amuse themselves by ordering the witchtooth to curse other changelings. In Arcadia, a witchtooth is feared by other changelings and sometimes by everyone Gentry except her Keeper. \\%0a\\%0a''Darkling:'' A predatory figure that resembles a stereotypical evil witch, with green skin and a long hooked nose. \\%0a''Fairest:'' A beautiful and terrifying figure who would appear utterly gorgeous, except for a few small features like featureless black eyes or subtly pointed teeth. \\%0a''Ogre:'' A gnarled witch, who has horns, cloven hooves, bird feet, or some other obvious animal feature. \\%0a\\%0a'''Kith Blessing:''' A Witchtooth gains an exceptional success on three successes instead of five on any Occult roll to recognize or study rituals, charms, hexes, curses, or blessings of any kind. \\%0a''Evil Eye:'' If a Witchtooth looks someone in the eye or points and curses them, the witchtooth can impose a hex on someone. Spend a point of Glamour and roll Wits + Occult + Wyrd, resisted by the opponent’s Resolve. For each success, one action of a type named by the Witchtooth during the curse will be resolved as if one less success were rolled by the target; if the roll is naturally a failure, it becomes a dramatic failure. A given subject can be cursed only once per chapter. %0a%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a

Balconies carved into the face of a towering mountain. Mansions with stilts that disappear into the fog unfathomable miles below. The changelings that become airtouched are as varied as the lofty realms in which they spent their durance. Floating, flying, or gliding was the only method of travel possible, and so their Keepers changed them.

Gentry who attempt to create new kiths by randomly combining portions of existing ones deliberately create some, but most chimeras are created accidentally, when changelings become infused with too much of Arcadia's changeable nature and their bodies alter in an uncontrolled fashion. Every chimera's appearance is different, often radically so.

By their nature, a coldscale is somewhat distant and if she feels strong emotions, she rarely express them. Before her Durance, a coldscale was usually an outsider, not as much because people rejected her, but because she choose to keep her distance from others. \\%0a%3c \\%0a%3c ''Darkling:'' A serpent-like creature colored so that it is easily overlooked, but disturbing to look upon. %0a%3c ''Elemental:'' A reptilian figure carved from living jade. %0a%3c ''Fairest:'' A sleek and elegant reptilian humanoid, with small attractively patterned scales. %0a%3c ''Ogre:'' Resembling a gila monster with large crocodile-like scutes, this creature appears exceptionally tough. \\%0a%3c \\%0a%3c '''Kith Blessing:''' When rolling Subterfuge to hide an intention to attack or otherwise act in a hostile manner, or to read another’s intention for the same, a Coldscale achieves an exceptional success on three successes instead of five. \\%0a%3c ''Reptilian Metabolism:'' The Coldscale can reflexively spend a point of Glamour to automatically succeed on a roll for resisting hunger, thirst, poison, heat, or lack of air; this can be done after failing the roll normally, but not after a dramatic failure.\\%0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c -----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25Dancer %0a%3c ''“I’ll make sure everyone’s eyes are on me. They always are, of course, but I mean more than usual this time.”'' \\%0a%3c \\%0a%3c There is an undeniable beauty inherent in all motion. The Lost who became dancers know this, though like everything in Fairies, that knowledge was paid for in ways best forgotten. Some  performed on stages of red-hot bronze or while wearing shoes of jagged crystal for their Keeper’s entertainment. Others served in palaces made of glittering knives, their agility necessary to carry out even basic actions.\\%0a%3c \\%0a%3c ''Beast:'' Long legs ending in three talented toes, an impossibly thin neck, and a fluttering train of emerald and sapphire feathers. \\%0a%3c ''Elemental:'' A frantically cavorting pillar of fire, a sinuously undulating column of water, a gently swaying tree, all vaguely humanoid. \\%0a%3c ''Fairest:'' Lithe, pliable limbs, exaggerated angular features, and flowing, dance-like movements to music only they can hear. \\%0a%3c \\%0a%3c '''Kith Blessing:''' A dancer gains an exceptional success on three successes instead of five for all Athletics and Expression rolls relating to dancing. \\%0a%3c ''Mesmerizing Movement:'' By spending a point of Glamour when dancing, and rolling Dexterity + Expression + Wyrd versus onlookers’ Composure + Supernatural Tolerance, the changeling can perform a dance so mesmerizing that it  becomes impossible to look at anyone but them for those that fail to contest the ability; any roll to notice anything else in the area that’s not within the same line of sight automatically fails, so long as the dance continues. This also inflicts the Obsession condition on them relating to the changeling. The effects end early if another power (prompting a Clash of Wills), damage greater than their Stamina, or a blinding effect that lasts a full turn or more is inflicted on the target(s). \\%0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c -----%0a%3c Draconic %0a%3c “Get out of this neighborhood! If I see either of you or any of your friends around here or if you try to send the Huntsmen after us, I'll know who to blame. I know who you two are and if anything I don't like happens, I’ll come for you both.” %0a%3c The Gentry create draconics to inspire fear and awe. These reptilian beasts are destructive %0a%3c creatures of primal terror. One Keeper who created a draconic might have wished own a %0a%3c wondrously impressive beast, another sought an impressive guard or military commander. %0a%3c Before their Durance, many draconics were interested in power and all of them were filled with %0a%3c confidence. Now, every draconic is terrifying and tough.  %0a%3c Beast: A horrifying reptilian monster with thick scales and long claws. %0a%3c Elemental: A dragon-like elemental beast, most appear to be made from stone, metal, or colored glass. %0a%3c Fairest: With his scales and elaborate crest, he is the essence of terrifying beauty. %0a%3c Wizened: She is clearly a human who has been remade into a dragon, with human eyes and the forms of human limbs beneath her scales. %0a%3c Kith Blessing: When using Intimidation to attempt to appear menacing or to ward a threat away, a Draconic gains an exceptional success on three successes.%0a%3c Scales: Immediately upon taking damage, a Draconic may spend a point of Glamour reflexively to toughen their scales, allowing them to transform up to three lethal damage into bashing damage. %0a%3c Gameplayer %0a%3c “That’s the third table I’ve seen her run tonight. I think she might be counting cards, but if she is, the house doesn’t seem to be able to catch her on it. I stopped playing casual games like chess with her a long time ago. After I make my first move, she tells me how the game plays out and she wins. It kind of takes the fun out of it.” %0a%3c For some True Fae, everything is a game played with pieces made of people’s lives and actions. No matter what type of game the Gentry favors, none enjoy losing, so they spend a great deal of time amusing themselves with games and rules that ensure their victory. A gameplayer was made to either be a part of a particular game, or was forced to play games for her master’s enjoyment, or both. She not only endured the endless hours of being part of a game, but also suffered the ire of her master if he happened to lose a game, even if it was not her fault. %0a%3c Elemental: He is a wooden or plastic game piece, with a crude humanoid shape. %0a%3c Fairest: The changeling is a stone or marble game piece, crafted with the ability to move about on her own. %0a%3c Wizened: The character may resemble a card or a deck of cards with legs and arms. %0a%3c Kith Blessing: When using Investigation to solve a puzzle, play a strategic game, or apply game theory to another problem, the changeling achieves an exceptional success on three successes.%0a%3c Game Theory: Once per scene, by spending a point of Glamour when making another roll, a Gameplayer can replace another Skill in that roll with Investigation, so long as they can somehow apply game theory or logic to the problem. %0a%3c Gravewright %0a%3c “Yes, this house is definitely haunted. No amount of insulation will fix that cool draft or the noises you hear at night. However, for a small fee, I can solve both your problems and the problems of your unfortunate spectral visitors.”%0a%3c The Gentry do not understand death, but some of their more disturbing realms have connections to the Underworld. Gentry with an interest in the dead create gravewrights as emissaries to the Underworld. One gravewright may visit the Underworld and stay, perhaps willingly, another might spend his Durance dealing with ghosts and Underworld creatures as well as with the Gentry. %0a%3c Darkling: A dry and skeletal creature that looks like a body that has been left buried in the sand for years. %0a%3c Fairest: With perfect skin bearing a hint of pearl grey color, a complete lack of body heat, and never a hair out of place, he looks like an especially lovely cinematic image of a vampire, lacking only the fangs. %0a%3c Ogre: A large creature with skin like well-aged rawhide and a somewhat corpse-like appearance. %0a%3c Kith Blessing: When using Occult to notice or study ghostly phenomena or anything involving the Underworld, a Gravewright gains an exceptional success with three successes.%0a%3c Eyes of the Grave: By spending a point of Glamour and rolling Wits + Occult as an instant action, the Gravewright can see, hear, touch, and speak to any nearby ghosts in Twilight for the scene, as well as recognize the Anchor, Open, Controlled, Materialized, or Underworld Gate Conditions, and intuit any Key to the latter. %0a%3c Gremlin %0a%3c “As he turned the key in the ignition, he heard the familiar roar of the car’s engine coming to life. This was followed quickly by the sound of the engine catching, backfiring, and then stalling out, a puff of smoke erupting from the hood.” %0a%3c The Gremlin is a mischievous dabbler who tends to like pulling mean pranks on others. She is %0a%3c small and seems harmless, which lets her get into a lot of trouble. A Gremlin is created solely for the amusement of her True Fae masters. The changeling served as a court jester and fool, making a mockery of guests and causing them pain and anguish in the name of her master. If she did not perform to whatever standards her master put to her each day, she was tortured until she performed better. Now she can’t help taking advantage of a situation to pull pranks and act out. %0a%3c Beast: She is an animal normally associated with mischievous behavior, such as a squirrel, weasel, or chimpanzee.  %0a%3c Ogre: She’s small and hunched with ugly green skin and warts all over her body. %0a%3c Wizened: The changeling is mostly humanoid with long fingers and long ears and big bright eyes. %0a%3c Kith Blessing: When making any Crafts roll to sabotage a machine, or cause an object to fail, break down, or otherwise work at less than full efficiency, the Gremlin gets an exceptional success with three successes.%0a%3c Gremlin’s Touch: As a Reflexive action, a Gremlin can spend a point of Glamour, touch a machine (complex or otherwise) and roll Wits + Crafts; each success causes one Structure damage that ignores Durability. %0a%3c Maker %0a%3c “I can have this done for you later tonight. If you are willing to wait until tomorrow, I can throw in an object file for making it via 3-d printing. That way, if you ever need another, someone can print you one. I could also get you set up with a 3-d printer of your own – they're really a lot of fun to work with.” %0a%3c The Gentry can steal and copy, but they cannot create anything truly new or unique. However, many desire new toys and entertainments above all else. They craft humans into makers so these individuals can spend their days creating toys or traps to thwart rivals and ensnare mortals. Other makers spent their Durance maintaining and refashioning their Keeper's existing toys.  %0a%3c Darkling: This goblin-like changeling has large eyes, long slender arms, and more than a dozen exceedingly long fingers, each of which has four or more joints.  %0a%3c Elemental: Made of metal and tempered glass, the changeling appears to be a sculpture with beautiful tools instead of hands, and not a trace of warm, weak flesh.  %0a%3c Fairest: This beautifully hairless and exceedingly flexible creature has more than a dozen long four jointed fingers. %0a%3c Kith Blessing: On any Crafts rolls to design, build, modify, repair, or understand any sort of device, a Maker gains an exceptional success with three successes. %0a%3c Creation: Once per scene, by spending a point of Glamour, a Maker can make a Build Equipment action with a single instant action that takes only one turn, without using “jury rigging” rules. They must otherwise be capable of the action, such as by having materials and tools available, however.   %0a%3c Manikin %0a%3c “If you think you can sneak past the guards, don't worry about me. Once we get in the storeroom, you set the fire and get out. When the smoke builds up, I'll open the door and flood the place with smoke. Then, I'll get the three captives out in the confusion, while you and Julia wait outside to take care of the loyalists.” %0a%3c Keepers who either enjoyed playing with living dolls or whose realms had no place for living %0a%3c flesh and blood transformed manikins from humans into artificial constructs. A manikin's new %0a%3c form is merely an imitation of humanity, but carries that imitation to a supernatural degree.  %0a%3c Fairest: A creation of metal, jewels, and perfectly crafted joints, this humanoid figure is stunning and elegant. %0a%3c Ogre: This terrifying creation is roughly humanoid and exceedingly functional. Within the limits of the humanoid form, little care was taken to make it appear beautiful or even particularly human. %0a%3c Wizened: Although no trace of flesh remains, it's clear that this construct of brushed aluminum, colored wires, and advanced circuits was made by replacing portions of a human body one piece at a time. %0a%3c Kith Blessing: A Manikin gets three successes instead of five on any Empathy roll to understand a mortal’s behavior.%0a%3c Imitation: By spending a point of Glamour, once per scene a Manikin may perfectly duplicate an entirely mundane action performed by another (humanoid) character, to the point of duplicating the number of successes and other results of the check.  %0a%3c Muse %0a%3c “I think that’s a fantastic idea. You should definitely make that mix tape. Your day job can wait.” %0a%3c Even the omnipotent True Fae occasionally lose their inspiration. Their bizarre realms go fallow %0a%3c and their nonsensical labors lie unfinished. Until the changelings that become Muses provide %0a%3c them with inspiration, drawn out by hot kisses or cold blades if need be. %0a%3c Elemental: Luminous flesh of coalescent creative potential, stretched like canvas over a frame built from crystallized inspiration. %0a%3c Fairest: A body begging to be sculpted, a voice that sparks symphonies, movement meant to be captured in dance, and eyes that bring obsession. %0a%3c Wizened: Papery wings that drop curls of parchment, silver-sharp pen nib fingertips, and a smoky breath that reeks of genius. %0a%3c Kith Blessing: When using Persuasion to Social Maneuver someone in a way that benefits one of their Aspirations, a Muse gains an exceptional success on three successes instead of five.%0a%3c Follow Your Dreams: Spend a Glamour and roll Presence + Wyrd, with the subject’s %0a%3c Resolve as a penalty if they are resistant to the idea of following their passion. If successful, the subject gains the Obsessed Condition related to an Aspiration of the subject’s choice. On an Exceptional success, the muse not only knows the subject’s Aspirations, but chooses which the target obsesses on. %0a%3c Nix %0a%3c “Isn't that the most amazing sunset you've seen in years? Let's go outside to get a better look. There's no one's around, so there won't be a problem if you leave your checkpoint for a minute or two, and the view is so much better out there.” %0a%3c Nixes are amphibious creatures created by Gentry who lived in aquatic realms. Most were forced to dwell on small islands or seashores, where their Keepers ordered them to lure intruders to their doom or to trap visitors with riddles or binding promises. Most of their Keepers lived in elaborate underwater splendor which their nixes rarely saw, with the exception of a few nixes that their Keepers used as storytellers. Before their Durance, the majority of nixes were %0a%3c unassuming people who were not obviously charismatic, but were gifted storytellers or sales people. %0a%3c Darkling: With the eyes and scales of fish and a beak like a squid, this creature appears strange and somewhat menacing. %0a%3c Elemental: A vaguely fish-like humanoid made from cloudy, opalescent water %0a%3c Ogre: She has the long sharp teeth of deep-sea fish, as well as patches of scales on her hide.  %0a%3c Kith Blessing: A nix gets an exceptional success on three successes for any Athletics roll to hold their breath underwater or swim. %0a%3c Siren: Nix are masters of distraction and misleading. By spending a point of Glamour and rolling Manipulation + Persuasion + Wyrd vs a target’s Resolve + Supernatural Tolerance, a Nix can speak to someone and convince them to follow the changeling, leave an area, or otherwise abandon a task for a scene. %0a%3c Oracle %0a%3c “Unless we do something to stop them, a team of Huntsmen will infiltrate the King of the West's ascension ceremony and try to kidnap him. I can find out more later, but that alone should be sufficient to perhaps allow us to prevent this disaster.” %0a%3c %0a%3c Oracles are changelings who have become slightly unstuck in time. Their Keepers find humans %0a%3c who are lucky or who have a talent for prophecy and enhance this ability so that the Oracles can %0a%3c provide them with information about the future. Some accompany their Keepers as living %0a%3c warning systems, while other spend their time locked away and only taken out to dispense %0a%3c prophecies to their Keeper and her allies. %0a%3c Beast: This raven-like creature has large eyes filled with shifting colors. %0a%3c Elemental: A creature made from living clockwork, with a clock dial for a face. %0a%3c Wizened: He has a third, obviously inhuman or artificial eye in the middle of his forehead. %0a%3c Kith Blessing: The character regularly catches glimpses of the next second or two. This provides the benefit of gaining an exceptional success on three successes when using Investigation to search for something hidden. %0a%3c Omen Sight: If an Oracle spends a point of Glamour and rolls Wits + Occult, they can look further into the future and can ask yes or no questions (1 per success) about the most likely future of a single person, place, or object known to them, such as whether a murder will occur in a location in the day. The further away the timespan, the less accurate the answers will tend to be. The player can only ask about the future of a single target only once per chapter.%0a%3c Swimmerskin %0a%3c “Come into the deeps with me %0a%3c Of the river, lake and sea %0a%3c Leave your troubles on the shore %0a%3c Leave your sail and your oar.” %0a%3c A swimmerskin is the quintessential merfolk of myth: curious, aloof and dangerous. Aquatic %0a%3c Keepers -- and those Gentry interested in seeding their maritime buffets with life -- introduce %0a%3c these changelings to the deep, cold pressures of faerie oceans and expect them to thrive. %0a%3c Predators, alien fishermen, and intelligent, poisonous waters harry these prisoners constantly. %0a%3c The ones that manage to flee generally do so at great personal cost. Too often, the swimmerskin that escapes through the Hedge finds they can no longer walk on land. %0a%3c Beast: Gnarly-limbed octopods with humanoid torsos and ink-black veins. Broad, sharp-tipped beaks for mouths with human teeth carved from baleen. Legs only functional as elegant fishtails. Gills that undulate when speaking. %0a%3c Elemental: Shell-like protrusions at the joints and curly, coral reef tresses. Schools of unidentifiable fish just beneath translucent blue skin. Rows of pale shark teeth. %0a%3c Fairest: Exotic, tropic fins and a glittering patina of colorful scales. Unbearably beautiful human faces, untouched by scale. Sea-shell clothing seamlessly adhered to curvaceous, eel-skin bodies. %0a%3c Wizened: Ghastly antique diving helmets huge, glass eyes. Brassy shoulder-blade propellers with leathery ligaments stretched across narrow crankshafts. Skin like waxy canvas.  %0a%3c Kith Blessing: A swimmerskin gets an exceptional success on three successes for any Athletics roll to swim, dive, perform underwater acrobatics, or otherwise maneuver within or into the water. %0a%3c Amphibious Kiss: By spending one Glamour, the swimmerskin can breathe water as easily as air for the scene. For an additional point, by touching a target’s lips, she can impart that ability to another at the same time, and can remove this gift at any time. %0a%3c Witchtooth %0a%3c “Young man, if you don't stop trying to break into that shop, you will soon regret your actions…”  %0a%3c “My, isn't that a loud alarm…”  %0a%3c “Officer, the young man ran, or rather stumbled that way, I doubt you'll have much trouble catching him.”  %0a%3c Gentry seeking to create a witchtooth typically find people who are filled with anger at the %0a%3c injustice of their lives and an interest in the occult. Most of these Gentry use the changeling as a %0a%3c tool against their rivals. Other Gentry amuse themselves by ordering the witchtooth to curse %0a%3c other changelings. In Arcadia, a witchtooth is feared by other changelings and sometimes by %0a%3c everyone Gentry except her Keeper. %0a%3c Darkling: A predatory figure that resembles a stereotypical evil witch, with green skin and a long hooked nose. %0a%3c Fairest: A beautiful and terrifying figure who would appear utterly gorgeous, except for a few small features like featureless black eyes or subtly pointed teeth. %0a%3c Ogre: A gnarled witch, who has horns, cloven hooves, bird feet, or some other obvious animal feature. %0a%3c Kith Blessing: A Witchtooth gains an exceptional success on three successes instead of five on any Occult roll to recognize or study rituals, charms, hexes, curses, or blessings of any kind. %0a%3c Evil Eye: If a Witchtooth looks someone in the eye or points and curses them, the witchtooth can impose a hex on someone. Spend a point of Glamour and roll Wits + Occult + Wyrd, resisted by the opponent’s Resolve. For each success, one action of a type named by the Witchtooth during the curse will be resolved as if one less success were rolled by the target; if the roll is naturally a failure, it becomes a dramatic failure. A given subject can be cursed only once per chapter. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a
