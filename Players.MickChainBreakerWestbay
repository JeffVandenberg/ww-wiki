His mother, one of Ronald's daughters, and his father, Michael Jr., were slightly at odds with most of the family.  There had always been infighting, but none so bad as between Ronald and his daughter.  She refused to keep the Hayes name when she married, and even when Michael Jr. disappeared, she refused to change Mick's last name as well.  They moved away from the estate, even though they were there often enough, visiting cousins and speaking with Ronald.  The distinction was important to Sophia, though, as if to make a point to Ronald.%0a%0ahttps://i.imgur.com/kSK6C2F.png%0a%0aIt's a part of the family that no one ever tries to look at too close.  And that's the fact that those who have changed are looked at as if they're already an ancestor.  They're "dead" for lack of better terms. The death of their shadow twin and their pelt-brother is bad enough, but for at least a time, it's worse that the rest of the family mourns your own passing, into something else.%0a%0aAnd so it was that one day, Mick died.  In Kenton, where there'd been a history of strife, there came to be a rally of the Steel Union being assaulted by those who claimed that their lives, their possibilities, were being stolen from them, that the Union was a bad idea.  And it was being led by a man who was not a man, anymore.  He'd always been a piece of work, that left his humanity questionable at best, but now, it simply was that he wasn't human at all.  He was ridden, and he was stirring up old issues that were better left alone.  Mick did his best to diffuse the situation, but Luna had other plans for him.  Words failed, and Glory called...%0a%0a%25rfloat width=400px margin-top=0px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=25px%25https://media.giphy.com/media/Ks127c4EYo7Zu/giphy.gif%0aAs the Ridden showed themselves to the world there, Mick changed.  The injustice, the breaking of tradition...  all of it tore at him, and there, in front of the world to see, Mick changed...  Eighteen Ridden were killed, one after the other, as his honed rage pushed him further and further through crowds, ignoring those who ran, and focused on the man who caused this atrocity to begin with....%0a%0aThe newspapers read "Riots in Kenton, 18 dead, 107 Injured"...%0a%0ahttps://i.imgur.com/jOYpyQE.png%0a%0a%25lfloat width=400px margin-top=0px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=25px%25 https://thumbs.gfycat.com/LivelyDearCondor-size_restricted.gif%0aThere's never a dull moment when your life revolves around glory, and this was no exception.  The leader of a now defunct pack began to raise anti-Embassy sentiment by threatening Emissaries.  [[Charlie Caine]] and Regis were accosted by the one known to most simply as Archer.  And when confronted with such things, Archer offered war, instead of compromise.  He offered back stabbing, instead of peace...%0a%0aMick answered in kind, to show him that he was not as safe as he wished to pretend that he was.  He brought rains, downpours, in Park Rose, the place that they called home.  But much like anything that Mick touched at that time, other elements were in action.  The Storm King himself took the rains, and tried to drown the entire city.  It seems that the pack had been neglecting it's duties, and Beshilu ran rampant in the dark areas of the neighborhood, which was an affront to the elemental courts.%0a%0aMick took the fall for other's deeds, being thrown under the bus by the Alpha Pack, and had his very tribe ripped from him for a transgression he did not have direct involvement in.%0a%0aFor a time, Mick's world was one of nothing but hate.%0a%0a%0ahttps://i.imgur.com/J5JoSFN.png%0a%0aMick's time home from England has been fraught with turmoil in the Hayes family.  He came back to find the barrier his family tended waning, and the completion of vows brought not only the death of his former beta and cousin, [[Charlie Caine]] but also brought to bear old wounds for Mick.  His mother, dead for nearly two decades, came back into discussion, portents and dreams leading him on a chase that caused him to nearly lose his mind. The Hayes family has always had strange and spectacular things happen to and around them, and this was no exception.%0a%0a%25lfloat width=400px margin-top=0px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=25px%25 https://mythology.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The-Norns-380x240.jpg%0aSpirits called out, ghosts walked the lands, and in the end, Mick was turned into an instrument of change for a chain of events that had been set in motion shortly after the death of his mother and her friends, all around the same time.  A spirit, perverted by what it was based off beyond what was normally even possible, had stolen the bodies and souls of three women.  Three... cousins.  Mick's mother being one of them.  Each was weakened, each was barely hanging on, but each could feel the strings of destiny that needed to draw Mick in, to make the change that was needed.  Appearing where the spirits threatened to burn cuttings of the bushes the Hayes family brought from England, Rose and Lavender coaxed Mick into coming forward, meeting family long forgotten, saving them from the predation of disastrous spirits.%0a%0aMick was slowly being driven mad.  Visions, conspiracy, spiritual influence...  The Cahalith had no choice but to chase the dream that haunted him, to solve the mystery that had plagued his grandfathers for years.  Into the mountains, towards the Three Sisters Caldera.  A stop on the way to gather a map brought him face to face with the atrocities of the wilds around Portland, where the spirits have begun to ride animals and turn them cannibalistic.  Another blooded in danger, gored and mauled by ridden deer, and another piece of the puzzle, as these were Thrice-Born cousins who had been set to guard the passes, to deal with tourists, directing them away from the dangerous and sacred lands above.%0a%0a%25rfloat width=400px%25https://tesrenewal.com/files/HappyChappy/images/mg_3837.jpg%0aThere in the depths of the Caldera, Mick found what he had been looking for, the place that his mother and her cousins went to visit, to pick berries, to try to figure out why they were stalked by a spirit so foul, that it wound up being the end of them...  Tests were placed before him, flame and heat made the land unbearable, nearly too hot to walk upon, but he pressed on.  Pockets of magma rose to try to consume him, and finally a lake of acidic waters caustic and burning...%0a%0aComing through the trials, he finally faced the truth.  He had been drawn here by those long dead, who had grown weary, who wanted their final rest.  Imprisoned by a spirit of perverse murder, it railed at the fact that they had called a son, not a daughter, to feed it.  It tried to utterly destroy the Thrice-Born cousins, and Mick refused to let it happen, locking the spirit on this side of the gauntlet, and destroying it utterly...  What happened after is never spoken of, though the change to Mick's demeanor was instantly noticeable.  Calmer, softer, more forgiving.  Something happened in that cave after that changed the man forever. Even the spirits are quiet of it, knowing that some things are best left to private.%0a%0ahttps://i.imgur.com/36JhUtf.png%0a%0a*Battery, three charges, 2003 (charges dropped) %0a*Public Drunkeness, 2004 (charges dropped) %0a*Incitement of violence, 2005 (acquitted, 6 months served for contempt of court) %0a*Aggravated assault, two counts, 2005 (charges withdrawn) %0a*Assault with a deadly weapon, 2006 (grand jury failed to indict) %0a*Destruction of Private property, 2008 (acquitted, ten days served for contempt of court) %0a*Receiving Stolen Goods, 2010 (grand jury failed to indict) %0a*Terroristic Threats, 2011 (found guilty, overturned in appeals 2012) %0a*Disorderly conduct, five charges, 2012 (acquitted, 7 months served for contempt of court) %0a*Weapons Violation, incitement, 2013 (dismissed due to lack of evidence) %0a*Fraud, 2013 (complainants perjured themselves, mistrial) %0a*Incitement, 2014, seven charges (charges dropped, lack of evidence) %0a*Failure to Appear, 2015 (served three months for contempt) %0a----%0a!!%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/wlpLdWg.png%0a%0a!!!!%25color=#E41A0E%25 ''Patriarch of the Hayes'': %0aNeed something done?

The leader of a now defunct pack began to raise anti-Embassy sentiment by threatening Emissaries.  [[Charlie Caine]] and Regis were accosted by the one known to most simply as Archer.  And when confronted with such things, Archer offered war, instead of compromise.  He offered back stabbing, instead of peace...%0a%3c %0a%3c Mick answered in kind, to show him that he was not as safe as he wished to pretend that he was.  He brought rains, downpours, in Park Rose, the place that they called home.  But much like anything that Mick touched at that time, other elements were in action.  The Storm King himself took the rains, and tried to drown the entire city.  It seems that the pack had been neglecting it's duties, and Beshilu ran rampant in the dark areas of the neighborhood, which was an affront to the elemental courts.%0a%3c %0a%3c Mick took the fall for other's deeds, being thrown under the bus by the Alpha Pack, and had his very tribe ripped from him for a transgression he did not have direct involvement in.%0a%3c %0a%3c For a time, Mick's world was one of nothing but hate.%0a

In Kenton, where there'd been a history of strife, there came to be a rally of the Steel Union being assaulted by those who claimed that their lives, their possibilities, were being stolen from them, that the Union was a bad idea.  And it was being led by a man who was not a man, anymore.  He'd always been a piece of work, that left his humanity questionable at best, but now, it simply was that he wasn't human at all.  He was ridden, and he was stirring up old issues that were better left alone.  Mick did his best to diffuse the situation, but Luna had other plans for him.

His mother, one of Ronald's daughters, and his father, Michael Jr., were slightly at odds with most of the family.  There had always been infighting, but none so bad as between Ronald and his daughter.  She refused to keep the Hayes name when she married, and even when Michael Jr. disappeared, she refused to change Mick's last name as well.  They moved away from the estate, even though they were there often enough, visiting cousins and speaking with Ronald.  The distinction was important to Sophia, though, as if to make a point to Ronald.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25werewolf%25'+Big text+'%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25werewolf%25'+Rose and Lavender+'%0a%3c %0a%3c Mick's time home from England has been fraught with turmoil in the Hayes family.  He came back to find the barrier his family tended waning, and the completion of vows brought not only the death of his former beta and cousin, [[Charlie Caine]] but also brought to bear old wounds for Mick.  His mother, dead for nearly two decades, came back into discussion, portents and dreams leading him on a chase that caused him to nearly lose his mind. The Hayes family has always had strange and spectacular things happen to and around them, and this was no exception.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat width=400px margin-top=0px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=25px%25 https://mythology.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The-Norns-380x240.jpg%0a%3c Spirits called out, ghosts walked the lands, and in the end, Mick was turned into an instrument of change for a chain of events that had been set in motion shortly after the death of his mother and her friends, all around the same time.  A spirit, perverted by what it was based off beyond what was normally even possible, had stolen the bodies and souls of three women.  Three... cousins.  Mick's mother being one of them.  Each was weakened, each was barely hanging on, but each could feel the strings of destiny that needed to draw Mick in, to make the change that was needed.  Appearing where the spirits threatened to burn cuttings of the bushes the Hayes family brought from England, Rose and Lavender coaxed Mick into coming forward, meeting family long forgotten, saving them from the predation of disastrous spirits.%0a%3c %0a%3c Mick was slowly being driven mad.  Visions, conspiracy, spiritual influence...  The Cahalith had no choice but to chase the dream that haunted him, to solve the mystery that had plagued his grandfathers for years.  Into the mountains, towards the Three Sisters Caldera.  A stop on the way to gather a map brought him face to face with the atrocities of the wilds around Portland, where the spirits have begun to ride animals and turn them cannibalistic.  Another blooded in danger, gored and mauled by ridden deer, and another piece of the puzzle, as these were Thrice-Born cousins who had been set to guard the passes, to deal with tourists, directing them away from the dangerous and sacred lands above.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat width=400px%25https://tesrenewal.com/files/HappyChappy/images/mg_3837.jpg%0a%3c There in the depths of the Caldera, Mick found what he had been looking for, the place that his mother and her cousins went to visit, to pick berries, to try to figure out why they were stalked by a spirit so foul, that it wound up being the end of them...  Tests were placed before him, flame and heat made the land unbearable, nearly too hot to walk upon, but he pressed on.  Pockets of magma rose to try to consume him, and finally a lake of acidic waters caustic and burning...%0a%3c %0a%3c Coming through the trials, he finally faced the truth.  He had been drawn here by those long dead, who had grown weary, who wanted their final rest.  Imprisoned by a spirit of perverse murder, it railed at the fact that they had called a son, not a daughter, to feed it.  It tried to utterly destroy the Thrice-Born cousins, and Mick refused to let it happen, locking the spirit on this side of the gauntlet, and destroying it utterly...  What happened after is never spoken of, though the change to Mick's demeanor was instantly noticeable.  Calmer, softer, more forgiving.
