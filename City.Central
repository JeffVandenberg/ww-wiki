Home to many Cuban exiles, as well as many immigrants from Central and South America, Little Havana is named after Havana, the capital and largest city in Cuba.%0a%0aLittle Havana is noted as a center of social, cultural, and political activity in Miami. Its festivals, including the Calle Ocho Festival, Viernes Culturales/Cultural Fridays, the Three Kings Parade and others, have been televised to millions of people every year on different continents. It is also known for its landmarks, including Calle Ocho (SW 8th Street/Tamiami Trail), and its Walk of Fame (for famous artists and Latin personalities, including Celia Cruz, Willy Chirino, and Gloria Estefan), the Cuban Memorial Boulevard, Plaza de la Cubanidad, Domino Park, the Tower Theater, José Martí Park, the Firestone/Walgreens Building, St. John Bosco Catholic Church, Municipio de Santiago de Cuba and others.%0a%0aLittle Havana is the best known neighborhood for Cuban exiles in the world. It is characterized by its street life, restaurants, music and other cultural activities, mom and pop enterprises, political passion, and great warmth amongst its residents.%0a%0aIn 2015, Little Havana was included in the National Trust for Historic Preservation’s annual list of 11 Most Endangered Places. In 2017, the Trust declared it a national treasure.%0aOriginally a lower-middle-class Southern and a thriving Jewish neighborhood in the 1930s. The name "Little Havana" emerged in the 1960s as the concentration of Cubans in the area grew sharply. Little Havana is the name affixed to a sprawling neighborhood lying immediately west of Downtown Miami. It stretches west from the Miami River for several miles. This sobriquet was applied to the Shenandoah and Riverside neighborhoods in the 1960s, following the beginnings of a vast influx of Cuban refugees there. Little Havana is famous as the cultural and political capital of Cuban Americans, and the neighborhood is a center of the Cuban exile community.%0a%0aIn the 1960s, the NUMBER of Cubans fleeing Castro led the area to become a hotbed of counter-revolutionary activity. Arriving residents expected their stay in Miami would be temporary as Castro would be deposed. By 1970, the neighborhood was more than 85 percent Cuban. Rather than return to Havana, where Castro remained in power, Cuban Americans began residing in neighborhoods across Miami. Little Havana, however, remained a landing point for new immigrants and a stronghold for Cuban-owned businesses.%0a%0aAs of 2011, Little Havana has the highest concentration of Hispanics (98%25) in Miami. Within the Hispanic population, the Cuban population has experienced a substantial decrease from 84%25 in 1979 to 58%25 in 1989; however, a group of Hispanics from other countries, especially those from Nicaragua, Honduras, and other Central American countries has substantially increased since the late-1990s.

By 1930, this area of Biscayne Boulevard was the home of Sears (later Burdines) Store, and the Shrine Building (which still stands at NE 14th Street and Biscayne Blvd), all of which were designed and built by the Biscayne Boulevard Company in the Art Deco architectural style. The area from NE 13th to NE 16th Street was envisioned as a high-end shopping district. By 1930, early tenants in the Shrine Building included the Piggly-Wiggly grocery store, Biscayne-Page Electric Company, and the John Turner Piano Store on the first floor. Other tenants in 1930 were the Home Drug Store and the Burroughs Adding Machine Company.%0a%0aIn 1977, the Omni International Mall opened replacing much of the street-side stores with a suburban-style shopping mall. The mall brought many upscale stores to the Omni such as Emilio Pucci, Givenchy and Hermes. By the 1990s, however, the mall began to falter, and in 1991, Jordan Marsh closed, and in 1998, so did JC Penney. In 2000, the mall closed, and the area was reconverted into offices in 2007. Today, it houses a few office tenants and the Miami International University of Art and Design. It is also the corporate home of the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce. The name of the neighborhood today, comes from the name of the Omni Mall.%0a%0aIn the 2000s, rapid construction of high-rise residential skyscrapers has revitalized the neighborhood from urban blight. The area around Margaret Pace Park has seen large population growth from 2000 to 2010.

Originally called Colored Town during the Jim Crow era of the late 19th through the mid-20th century, the area was once the preeminent and is the historic center for commerce in the black community in Miami and South Florida.%0aA part of the historic heart of Miami, it was designated as a "colored" neighborhood after the creation and incorporation of Miami in 1896. The incorporation of Miami as a city occurred at the insistence of Standard Oil and FEC railroad tycoon Henry Flagler, whose mostly black American railroad construction workers settled near what became Downtown Miami, just north of Flagler's Royal Palm Hotel on the Miami River. Owing to a substantive black population, 168 of the 362 men who voted for the creation of the city of Miami were counted as "colored," but the separate but equal segregation laws of the Deep South dictated the city designate the portion of the city, in this case, north and west of FEC railroad tracks, as "Colored Town."%0a%0aThe second-oldest continuously inhabited neighborhood of the Miami area after Coconut Grove, the area thrived as a center for commerce, primarily along Northwest Second Avenue. Home to the Lyric Theatre (completed in 1913) and other businesses, West Second Avenue served as the main street of the black community during an era which, up until the Civil Rights Act of 1964, barred black residents from entering middle and upper income white areas like Miami Beach and Coral Gables without "passes." During the Florida land boom of the 1920s, Overtown was home to one of the first black millionaires in the American South, D. A. Dorsey (who once owned Fisher Island), and the original Booker T. Washington High School, then the first high school educating black students south of Palm Beach. Community organizing and mobilization during the era, as such in actions of Reverend John Culmer, who advocated for better living conditions for lower class blacks living in abject squalor during the 1920s, led to the completion of Liberty Square in 1937 in what is now-called Liberty City. Northwest Second Avenue and the surrounding neighborhood, once-called the "Little Broadway" of the South, by the 1940s hosted hundreds of mostly black-owned businesses, ranging from libraries and social organizations to a hospital and popular nightclubs.%0a%0aPopular with blacks and whites alike, Overtown was a center for nightly entertainment in Miami, comparable to Miami Beach, at its height post-World War II in the 1940s and 1950s. The area served as a place of rest and refuge for black mainstream entertainers such as Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, Cab Calloway, Josephine Baker, Billie Holiday, and Nat King Cole who were not allowed to lodge at prominent venues where they performed like the Fontainebleau and the Eden Roc, where Overtown hotels like the Mary Elizabeth Hotel furnished to their needs. Further, many prominent black luminaries like W. E. B. Du Bois, Zora Neale Hurston, Joe Louis and Jackie Robinson lodged and entertained in the neighborhood.%0a%0aThe area experienced serious economic decline from the late 1950s. Issues ranging from urban renewal to the construction of interstate highways like I-95 (then, the North-South Expressway), the Dolphin Expressway and the Midtown Interchange in the 1960s, fragmented the-once thriving center with the resident population decimated by nearly 80 percent from roughly 50,000 to just over 10,000. The area became economically destitute and considered a "ghetto" as businesses closed and productivity stagnated in the neighborhood.%0a%0aDevelopment was spurred in the area again in the late 1980s with the construction and completion of the Miami Arena and transit-oriented development surrounding the newly opened Overtown station.%0a%0aSince the 1990s and 2000s, community gardens have been created, in addition to renovations to the historic Lyric Theatre and revitalization and gentrification efforts spurred both by the city of Miami and Miami-Dade County. Dr. Marvin Dunn founded the original Roots in the City Overtown Community Garden, turning an "overgrown, littered lot into a flourishing garden" maintained by Overtown residents and volunteers.[ Roots in the City, a non-profit "dedicated to community development, job training, inner-city beautification, healthy eating initiatives, and community research" used the Community Gardens provide affordable fresh produce to low-income families, public school students, community agencies and homeless shelters. and is also organizes an urban farmer's market. These projects and other aspects of Overtown were featured in a short documentary The Ground under Overtown centered on a multi-issue multi-racial community organizing created around Florida protests against the FTAA with focused on environmental racism, critiques of so-called "Free trade" agreements like the FTAA, and positive community solutions such as permaculture. Anti-FTAA protesters at Dr. Dunn's invitation held a workshop on permaculture at the Overtown Community Garden and donated over 100 cherry trees to the Overtown community.%0a%0aIn 2015, David Beckham announced that he had secured land in the neighborhood for a future, since named Major League Soccer expansion franchise in Miami, although the team has since proposed a stadium at a different site in the city.%0a%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' •%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Park West''%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/RKyDH2d.jpg%0aWest Miami is a suburb of Miami with a population of 7,046.

The area came to be called “Riverside” for its location next to the Miami River. Mary Brickell (a member of one of Miami’s prominent pioneer families) platted the Riverside subdivision. The most important developers of the areas were the Tatum brothers, creators of the Lawrence Estate Land Company subdivision which represented a large segment of Riverside. They came to Miami from Dawson, Georgia in the late 1890s. The Tatum brothers’ advertisements characterized the area as “The Beautiful Ridge” owing to its verdant, elevated terrain close to the river. In an advertisement appearing in 1906, J.H. Tatum and company exhorted Miamians to “buy a lot in Riverside”, especially since “the electric trolley line will be completed through (Riverside) in 90 days and the price of all lots will be increased 50%25”. The Tatum’s sold lots in Riverside, in 1904 for $300 to $350. The area during its early history contained many elegant two story frame homes. As the second and third decade of the 20th century unfolded, many of the newer homes were bungalows.%0a%0aThe Riverside area was connected to nearby downtown Miami by the 12th Street (later Flagler Street) bridge, which opened as a toll-roadway in 1905. The tolls were steep for the time: 10 cents for a pedestrian: 25 cents for a horse-drawn cart. In 1909, the City of Miami purchased the facility and removed the tolls. Broad Flagler Street was the area’s most important thoroughfare. A Flagler Street trolley began operating in 1915, carrying passengers as far west as S.W. 12th Avenue. Businesses and splendid homes arose along both sides of Flagler Street in the early 1900s. Prominent Miamians of the era lived in the Riverside area. By the 1930s, Riverside’s population was changing. Increasing number of Jews moved into the area, and many of their businesses, professional offices, and institutions accompanied them. The Jewish presence continued to grow, and remained a major element of the population until the late 1950s, when an era of postwar prosperity brought another housing boom to Greater Miami. The boom prompted many Riverside residents to suburban developments throughout Dade County.%0a%0aThe earliest Cubans in Miami for which there are recorded information were the Eduardo Luis Gonzalez family who were here in 1896. Another early Cuban family recorded was the Encinosas, who had a home in 1922 at 120 S.W. 8th Street. By the early 20th century a significant number of Cubans already resided in the Riverside area. Riverside’s population mix has undergone many changes in recent decades as huge number of Cubans, Nicaraguans, and other Caribbean and Latin American refugees poured into the area. Because of its large Cuban population, the area began to be called Little Havana or East Little Havana.%0a%0aI-95, which was completed through Miami Dade County in the late 1960s was built along some of the Riverside area making an impact on the neighborhood. The area beneath I-95 close to the Miami River served as a temporary home in the summer and fall of 1980 for hundreds of Cuban refugees from the Port of Mariel. One of the most prominent landmarks of the Riverside area is the Firestone service station. It was built in 1929 under the personal supervision of Harvey Firestone, who had a mansion on Miami Beach, it was billed as the largest Firestone facility in the world and was considered Mr. Firestone's favorite store. It also sported what was at the time, the largest neon sign in Florida. Although Riverside has been transformed into a vibrant Latin Quarter and many of its historic buildings have been demolished, the Firestone structure still dominates the corner of Flagler Street and Twelfth Avenue. After the building was sold to Walgreens, preservationists convinced the company to retain the old structure, thus guaranteeing its continued presence as a neighborhood icon.%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' •%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Shenandoah''%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/9w7KSFO.jpg%0aShenandoah is one of the first Neighborhoods in the City of Miami.

By the 1850s, William Wagner and a business partner reestablished a coontie mill on a Miami River tributary which would be named after Wagner. A freshwater spring was found on the tributary in the area, which caused Henry Flagler to build the private Miami Water Company (where a Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Treatment plant is currently located) there in 1899.%0a%0aBy 1918, German-born Miami industrialist John Seybold dredged the Wagner Creek and constructed a turning basin in the creek, prompting area officials to rename the creek "Seybold Canal" in his honor; Seybold purchased and platted the peninsular plot of land immediately south of North 11th Street between the River and Creek for private, residential development, advertising it as one of Miami's premier housing communities into the Florida land boom of the 1920s.%0a%0aIn 1997 Spring Garden was designated as an official Historic District in the City of Miami. The summary statement from the historic designation report prepared by resident and architectural historian Prof. John Kneski states that "The Spring Garden Historic District is significant in the historical, archeological, and architectural heritage of the City of Miami. This neighborhood reflects the City’s growth from the mid-1910’s to the 1940’s and demonstrates the importance of the Miami River in the City’s history. Developed by an important pioneer businessman, Spring Garden is the oldest, intact, single family neighborhood still remaining along the Miami River."%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' ••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''The Roads''%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/gYGVQkO.jpg%0aThe Roads is known for its old homes, historic private schools, and its tree-covered streets.

Flagler, along with developers such as William Brickell and George E. Merrick helped bring developer interest to the city with the construction of hotels, resorts, homes, and the extension of Flagler's rail line.

With recent mass construction of high-rise residential buildings and office towers, Downtown has experienced large growth, with new shops, bars, parks, and restaurants opening up, attracting many new residents. Along with Brickell, Downtown has grown from 40,000 residents in 2000, to over 70,000 in 2009, making it one of the fastest-growing areas in Florida. It was estimated in February 2010, that about 550 new residents move to the Downtown area every month. As of 2009, over 190,000 office employees work in Downtown and Brickell.%0a%3c %0a%3c Downtown is served by the Miami Metrorail at Historic Overtown/Lyric Theatre, Government Center, and Brickell stations, accessible from Broward and Palm Beach counties via Tri-Rail transfer station. The Metro connects to the Downtown Metromover, which encompasses 22 stations on the clockwise Inner (or Downtown) loop and counterclockwise Brickell and Omni branch loops. Government Center station is Downtown's main station and allows for transfers to all Metromover loops, Metrorail trains, and Metrobus lines at the Stephen P.

The incorporation of Miami as a city occurred at the insistence of Standard Oil and FEC railroad tycoon Henry Flagler, whose mostly black American railroad construction workers settled near what became Downtown Miami, just north of Flagler's Royal Palm Hotel on the Miami River. Owing to a substantive black population, 168 of the 362 men who voted for the creation of the city of Miami were counted as "colored," but the separate but equal segregation laws of the Deep South dictated the city designate the portion of the city, in this case, north and west of FEC railroad tracks, as "Colored Town."%0a> %0a> The second-oldest continuously inhabited neighborhood of the Miami area after Coconut Grove, the area thrived as a center for commerce, primarily along Northwest Second Avenue.

During the Florida land boom of the 1920s, Overtown was home to one of the first black millionaires in the American South, D. A. Dorsey (who once owned Fisher Island), and the original Booker T. Washington High School, then the first high school educating black students south of Palm Beach. Community organizing and mobilization during the era, as such in actions of Reverend John Culmer, who advocated for better living conditions for lower class blacks living in abject squalor during the 1920s, led to the completion of Liberty Square in 1937 in what is now-called Liberty City.

Further, many prominent black luminaries like W. E. B. Du Bois, Zora Neale Hurston, Joe Louis and Jackie Robinson lodged and entertained in the neighborhood.%0a> %0a> The area experienced serious economic decline from the late 1950s. Issues ranging from urban renewal to the construction of interstate highways like I-95 (then, the North-South Expressway), the Dolphin Expressway and the Midtown Interchange in the 1960s, fragmented the-once thriving center with the resident population decimated by nearly 80 percent from roughly 50,000 to just over 10,000.

The name "Little Havana" emerged in the 1960s as the concentration of Cubans in the area grew sharply. Little Havana is the name affixed to a sprawling neighborhood lying immediately west of Downtown Miami. It stretches west from the Miami River for several miles. This sobriquet was applied to the Shenandoah and Riverside neighborhoods in the 1960s, following the beginnings of a vast influx of Cuban refugees there. Little Havana is famous as the cultural and political capital of Cuban Americans, and the neighborhood is a center of the Cuban exile community.%0a%3c %0a%3c In the 1960s, the NUMBER of Cubans fleeing Castro led the area to become a hotbed of counter-revolutionary activity. Arriving residents expected their stay in Miami would be temporary as Castro would be deposed. By 1970, the neighborhood was more than 85 percent Cuban. Rather than return to Havana, where Castro remained in power, Cuban Americans began residing in neighborhoods across Miami. Little Havana, however, remained a landing point for new immigrants and a stronghold for Cuban-owned businesses.%0a%3c %0a%3c As of 2011, Little Havana has the highest concentration of Hispanics (98%25) in Miami.

Originally called Colored Town during the Jim Crow era of the late 19th through the mid-20th century, the area was once the preeminent and is the historic center for commerce in the black community in Miami and South Florida.%0a%3c A part of the historic heart of Miami, it was designated as a "colored" neighborhood after the creation and incorporation of Miami in 1896. The incorporation of Miami as a city occurred at the insistence of Standard Oil and FEC railroad tycoon Henry Flagler, whose mostly black American railroad construction workers settled near what became Downtown Miami, just north of Flagler's Royal Palm Hotel on the Miami River. Owing to a substantive black population, 168 of the 362 men who voted for the creation of the city of Miami were counted as "colored," but the separate but equal segregation laws of the Deep South dictated the city designate the portion of the city, in this case, north and west of FEC railroad tracks, as "Colored Town."%0a%3c %0a%3c The second-oldest continuously inhabited neighborhood of the Miami area after Coconut Grove, the area thrived as a center for commerce, primarily along Northwest Second Avenue. Home to the Lyric Theatre (completed in 1913) and other businesses, West Second Avenue served as the main street of the black community during an era which, up until the Civil Rights Act of 1964, barred black residents from entering middle and upper income white areas like Miami Beach and Coral Gables without "passes." During the Florida land boom of the 1920s, Overtown was home to one of the first black millionaires in the American South, D. A. Dorsey (who once owned Fisher Island), and the original Booker T. Washington High School, then the first high school educating black students south of Palm Beach. Community organizing and mobilization during the era, as such in actions of Reverend John Culmer, who advocated for better living conditions for lower class blacks living in abject squalor during the 1920s, led to the completion of Liberty Square in 1937 in what is now-called Liberty City. Northwest Second Avenue and the surrounding neighborhood, once-called the "Little Broadway" of the South, by the 1940s hosted hundreds of mostly black-owned businesses, ranging from libraries and social organizations to a hospital and popular nightclubs.%0a%3c %0a%3c Popular with blacks and whites alike, Overtown was a center for nightly entertainment in Miami, comparable to Miami Beach, at its height post-World War II in the 1940s and 1950s. The area served as a place of rest and refuge for black mainstream entertainers such as Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, Cab Calloway, Josephine Baker, Billie Holiday, and Nat King Cole who were not allowed to lodge at prominent venues where they performed like the Fontainebleau and the Eden Roc, where Overtown hotels like the Mary Elizabeth Hotel furnished to their needs. Further, many prominent black luminaries like W. E. B. Du Bois, Zora Neale Hurston, Joe Louis and Jackie Robinson lodged and entertained in the neighborhood.%0a%3c %0a%3c The area experienced serious economic decline from the late 1950s. Issues ranging from urban renewal to the construction of interstate highways like I-95 (then, the North-South Expressway), the Dolphin Expressway and the Midtown Interchange in the 1960s, fragmented the-once thriving center with the resident population decimated by nearly 80 percent from roughly 50,000 to just over 10,000. The area became economically destitute and considered a "ghetto" as businesses closed and productivity stagnated in the neighborhood.%0a%3c %0a%3c Development was spurred in the area again in the late 1980s with the construction and completion of the Miami Arena and transit-oriented development surrounding the newly opened Overtown station.%0a%3c %0a%3c Since the 1990s and 2000s, community gardens have been created, in addition to renovations to the historic Lyric Theatre and revitalization and gentrification efforts spurred both by the city of Miami and Miami-Dade County.

The area came to be called “Riverside” for its location next to the Miami River. Mary Brickell (a member of one of Miami’s prominent pioneer families) platted the Riverside subdivision. The most important developers of the areas were the Tatum brothers, creators of the Lawrence Estate Land Company subdivision which represented a large segment of Riverside. They came to Miami from Dawson, Georgia in the late 1890s. The Tatum brothers’ advertisements characterized the area as “The Beautiful Ridge” owing to its verdant, elevated terrain close to the river. In an advertisement appearing in 1906, J.H. Tatum and company exhorted Miamians to “buy a lot in Riverside”, especially since “the electric trolley line will be completed through (Riverside) in 90 days and the price of all lots will be increased 50%25”. The Tatum’s sold lots in Riverside, in 1904 for $300 to $350. The area during its early history contained many elegant two story frame homes. As the second and third decade of the 20th century unfolded, many of the newer homes were bungalows.%0a> %0a> The Riverside area was connected to nearby downtown Miami by the 12th Street (later Flagler Street) bridge, which opened as a toll-roadway in 1905. The tolls were steep for the time: 10 cents for a pedestrian: 25 cents for a horse-drawn cart. In 1909, the City of Miami purchased the facility and removed the tolls. Broad Flagler Street was the area’s most important thoroughfare. A Flagler Street trolley began operating in 1915, carrying passengers as far west as S.W. 12th Avenue. Businesses and splendid homes arose along both sides of Flagler Street in the early 1900s. Prominent Miamians of the era lived in the Riverside area. By the 1930s, Riverside’s population was changing. Increasing number of Jews moved into the area, and many of their businesses, professional offices, and institutions accompanied them. The Jewish presence continued to grow, and remained a major element of the population until the late 1950s, when an era of postwar prosperity brought another housing boom to Greater Miami. The boom prompted many Riverside residents to suburban developments throughout Dade County.%0a> %0a> The earliest Cubans in Miami for which there are recorded information were the Eduardo Luis Gonzalez family who were here in 1896. Another early Cuban family recorded was the Encinosas, who had a home in 1922 at 120 S.W. 8th Street. By the early 20th century a significant number of Cubans already resided in the Riverside area. Riverside’s population mix has undergone many changes in recent decades as huge number of Cubans, Nicaraguans, and other Caribbean and Latin American refugees poured into the area. Because of its large Cuban population, the area began to be called Little Havana or East Little Havana.%0a> %0a> I-95, which was completed through Miami Dade County in the late 1960s was built along some of the Riverside area making an impact on the neighborhood. The area beneath I-95 close to the Miami River served as a temporary home in the summer and fall of 1980 for hundreds of Cuban refugees from the Port of Mariel. One of the most prominent landmarks of the Riverside area is the Firestone service station. It was built in 1929 under the personal supervision of Harvey Firestone, who had a mansion on Miami Beach, it was billed as the largest Firestone facility in the world and was considered Mr. Firestone's favorite store. It also sported what was at the time, the largest neon sign in Florida. Although Riverside has been transformed into a vibrant Latin Quarter and many of its historic buildings have been demolished, the Firestone structure still dominates the corner of Flagler Street and Twelfth Avenue.

The most important developers of the areas were the Tatum brothers, creators of the Lawrence Estate Land Company subdivision which represented a large segment of Riverside. They came to Miami from Dawson, Georgia in the late 1890s. The Tatum brothers’ advertisements characterized the area as “The Beautiful Ridge” owing to its verdant, elevated terrain close to the river. In an advertisement appearing in 1906, J.H. Tatum and company exhorted Miamians to “buy a lot in Riverside”, especially since “the electric trolley line will be completed through (Riverside) in 90 days and the price of all lots will be increased 50%25”. The Tatum’s sold lots in Riverside, in 1904 for $300 to $350. The area during its early history contained many elegant two story frame homes. As the second and third decade of the 20th century unfolded, many of the newer homes were bungalows.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Riverside area was connected to nearby downtown Miami by the 12th Street (later Flagler Street) bridge, which opened as a toll-roadway in 1905. The tolls were steep for the time: 10 cents for a pedestrian: 25 cents for a horse-drawn cart. In 1909, the City of Miami purchased the facility and removed the tolls. Broad Flagler Street was the area’s most important thoroughfare. A Flagler Street trolley began operating in 1915, carrying passengers as far west as S.W. 12th Avenue. Businesses and splendid homes arose along both sides of Flagler Street in the early 1900s. Prominent Miamians of the era lived in the Riverside area. By the 1930s, Riverside’s population was changing. Increasing number of Jews moved into the area, and many of their businesses, professional offices, and institutions accompanied them. The Jewish presence continued to grow, and remained a major element of the population until the late 1950s, when an era of postwar prosperity brought another housing boom to Greater Miami. The boom prompted many Riverside residents to suburban developments throughout Dade County.%0a%3c %0a%3c The earliest Cubans in Miami for which there are recorded information were the Eduardo Luis Gonzalez family who were here in 1896. Another early Cuban family recorded was the Encinosas, who had a home in 1922 at 120 S.W. 8th Street. By the early 20th century a significant number of Cubans already resided in the Riverside area. Riverside’s population mix has undergone many changes in recent decades as huge number of Cubans, Nicaraguans, and other Caribbean and Latin American refugees poured into the area. Because of its large Cuban population, the area began to be called Little Havana or East Little Havana.%0a%3c %0a%3c I-95, which was completed through Miami Dade County in the late 1960s was built along some of the Riverside area making an impact on the neighborhood. The area beneath I-95 close to the Miami River served as a temporary home in the summer and fall of 1980 for hundreds of Cuban refugees from the Port of Mariel. One of the most prominent landmarks of the Riverside area is the Firestone service station. It was built in 1929 under the personal supervision of Harvey Firestone, who had a mansion on Miami Beach, it was billed as the largest Firestone facility in the world and was considered Mr. Firestone's favorite store. It also sported what was at the time, the largest neon sign in Florida. Although Riverside has been transformed into a vibrant Latin Quarter and many of its historic buildings have been demolished, the Firestone structure still dominates the corner of Flagler Street and Twelfth Avenue. After the building was sold to Walgreens, preservationists convinced the company to retain the old structure, thus guaranteeing its continued presence as a neighborhood icon.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25''Little Havana''%0a> %0a> Little Havana (Spanish: Pequeña Habana) is a neighborhood of Miami, Florida, United States.

In 2017, the Trust declared it a national treasure.%0a> Originally a lower-middle-class Southern and a thriving Jewish neighborhood in the 1930s. The name "Little Havana" emerged in the 1960s as the concentration of Cubans in the area grew sharply. Little Havana is the name affixed to a sprawling neighborhood lying immediately west of Downtown Miami. It stretches west from the Miami River for several miles. This sobriquet was applied to the Shenandoah and Riverside neighborhoods in the 1960s, following the beginnings of a vast influx of Cuban refugees there. Little Havana is famous as the cultural and political capital of Cuban Americans, and the neighborhood is a center of the Cuban exile community.%0a> %0a> In the 1960s, the NUMBER of Cubans fleeing Castro led the area to become a hotbed of counter-revolutionary activity. Arriving residents expected their stay in Miami would be temporary as Castro would be deposed. By 1970, the neighborhood was more than 85 percent Cuban. Rather than return to Havana, where Castro remained in power, Cuban Americans began residing in neighborhoods across Miami. Little Havana, however, remained a landing point for new immigrants and a stronghold for Cuban-owned businesses.%0a> %0a> As of 2011, Little Havana has the highest concentration of Hispanics (98%25) in Miami. Within the Hispanic population, the Cuban population has experienced a substantial decrease from 84%25 in 1979 to 58%25 in 1989; however, a group of Hispanics from other countries, especially those from Nicaragua, Honduras, and other Central American countries has substantially increased since the late-1990s.

By the 1850s, William Wagner and a business partner reestablished a coontie mill on a Miami River tributary which would be named after Wagner. A freshwater spring was found on the tributary in the area, which caused Henry Flagler to build the private Miami Water Company (where a Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Treatment plant is currently located) there in 1899.%0a%3c %0a%3c By 1918, German-born Miami industrialist John Seybold dredged the Wagner Creek and constructed a turning basin in the creek, prompting area officials to rename the creek "Seybold Canal" in his honor; Seybold purchased and platted the peninsular plot of land immediately south of North 11th Street between the River and Creek for private, residential development, advertising it as one of Miami's premier housing communities into the Florida land boom of the 1920s.%0a%3c %0a%3c In 1997 Spring Garden was designated as an official Historic District in the City of Miami.

Originally called Colored Town during the Jim Crow era of the late 19th through the mid-20th century, the area was once the preeminent and is the historic center for commerce in the black community in Miami and South Florida.%0a%3c A part of the historic heart of Miami, it was designated as a "colored" neighborhood after the creation and incorporation of Miami in 1896. The incorporation of Miami as a city occurred at the insistence of Standard Oil and FEC railroad tycoon Henry Flagler, whose mostly black American railroad construction workers settled near what became Downtown Miami, just north of Flagler's Royal Palm Hotel on the Miami River. Owing to a substantive black population, 168 of the 362 men who voted for the creation of the city of Miami were counted as "colored," but the separate but equal segregation laws of the Deep South dictated the city designate the portion of the city, in this case, north and west of FEC railroad tracks, as "Colored Town."%0a%3c %0a%3c The second-oldest continuously inhabited neighborhood of the Miami area after Coconut Grove, the area thrived as a center for commerce, primarily along Northwest Second Avenue. Home to the Lyric Theatre (completed in 1913) and other businesses, West Second Avenue served as the main street of the black community during an era which, up until the Civil Rights Act of 1964, barred black residents from entering middle and upper income white areas like Miami Beach and Coral Gables without "passes." During the Florida land boom of the 1920s, Overtown was home to one of the first black millionaires in the American South, D. A. Dorsey (who once owned Fisher Island), and the original Booker T. Washington High School, then the first high school educating black students south of Palm Beach. Community organizing and mobilization during the era, as such in actions of Reverend John Culmer, who advocated for better living conditions for lower class blacks living in abject squalor during the 1920s, led to the completion of Liberty Square in 1937 in what is now-called Liberty City. Northwest Second Avenue and the surrounding neighborhood, once-called the "Little Broadway" of the South, by the 1940s hosted hundreds of mostly black-owned businesses, ranging from libraries and social organizations to a hospital and popular nightclubs.%0a%3c %0a%3c Popular with blacks and whites alike, Overtown was a center for nightly entertainment in Miami, comparable to Miami Beach, at its height post-World War II in the 1940s and 1950s. The area served as a place of rest and refuge for black mainstream entertainers such as Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, Cab Calloway, Josephine Baker, Billie Holiday, and Nat King Cole who were not allowed to lodge at prominent venues where they performed like the Fontainebleau and the Eden Roc, where Overtown hotels like the Mary Elizabeth Hotel furnished to their needs. Further, many prominent black luminaries like W. E. B. Du Bois, Zora Neale Hurston, Joe Louis and Jackie Robinson lodged and entertained in the neighborhood.%0a%3c %0a%3c The area experienced serious economic decline from the late 1950s. Issues ranging from urban renewal to the construction of interstate highways like I-95 (then, the North-South Expressway), the Dolphin Expressway and the Midtown Interchange in the 1960s, fragmented the-once thriving center with the resident population decimated by nearly 80 percent from roughly 50,000 to just over 10,000. The area became economically destitute and considered a "ghetto" as businesses closed and productivity stagnated in the neighborhood.%0a%3c %0a%3c Development was spurred in the area again in the late 1980s with the construction and completion of the Miami Arena and transit-oriented development surrounding the newly opened Overtown station.%0a%3c %0a%3c Since the 1990s and 2000s, community gardens have been created, in addition to renovations to the historic Lyric Theatre and revitalization and gentrification efforts spurred both by the city of Miami and Miami-Dade County.

It has little of the Bohemian flair found in other popular neighborhoods throughout Portland, and its two main streets (Sandy Blvd. and Northeast Broadway) are relatively high-speed thoroughfares that don't encourage pause.%0a> %0a> %0a> The best way to appreciate Hollywood is to take to the sidewalks. A slower pace reveals a lot to like about this neighborhood.  If your tour starts as you cross over I-84, two unusual places – well, they would be unusual if this wasn't Portland – flank you on either side of Sandy Blvd. as you enter the district via its southeast corner. To your right is Tony Starlight's Supperclub & Lounge, where you may enjoy cocktails and smoky jazz and blues with the rest of the swells. A reason to bust your swanky finery out of the closet!%0a> %0a> To the left across the street is the bottle-shaped facade of what was originally Steigerwald Dairy Company in the 1920s (the bottle was later reshaped to represent 7-Up, and today it bears the Budweiser logo). This building houses two shops that appeal to the outdoor adventurer: Mountain Shop, for all things skiing, snowboarding, and climbing, and Rip City Skate, for longboards and skateboards and accessories (where you can try out the goods on their ramp in the back!).%0a> %0a> Should you have a yen (oops, make that a yuan) for Northern Chinese cuisine, stroll or briskly stride up 37th Avenue and hang a right onto NE Broadway to Shandong Restaurant and have a steaming bowl of Dragon in the Garden soup and potstickers. Sushi more your style? Bluefin Sushi Bar is for you, then (which is also on Broadway but you'll have to go back south to Sandy Blvd. and then head east and look for the Sandy/Broadway split just the other side of NE 39th; part of the Hollywood District's “charm” is it's wacky street dynamics.  If a street can have a lighthouse, then Sandy Boulevard's is the venerable Hollywood Theatre, a showcase for cinematic fare both classic and contemporary. A not-for-profit organization sees to the renovation and improvements to the grand old lady, and has volunteer opportunities and internships available for those with an itch to contribute. Please do take in a viewing and a pint and inquire.%0a> %0a> From this point you may take the crosswalk to Magnolia's Corner across the street from the theater to enjoy a glass (or a bottle) of wine, or simply walk a very few steps up to Aliviar Coffeehouse to savor a flavorful and lovingly-brewed coffee. Or take a left on 42nd Avenue and trot up to The Moon and Sixpence for a taste of Old Blighty. Cheers!%0a> %0a> Quick! Run into TigerLily Tattoo and Designworks and get that ink done that you've always wanted to dare yourself to get. Then head into Pal's Shanty Tavern to anesthetize the burn. Or maybe vice-versa, for courage?%0a> %0a> If all you really want after all is a nice walk through a neighborhood with beautiful greenery and lovely homes, just turn north. The residential areas of the Hollywood District are quiet and calm under leaf-laden trees, a very pleasant surcease after experiencing the rush and roar of the big streets. They inspire a wish to wander. And so you should.  A good mix of everyone lives, plays, eats and imbibes here. This is a walker's paradise.  This area features many older Portland homes full of character and charm.  Tree lined streets, covered porches, and families taking a stroll...  Plus, Hollywood is conveniently located along major streets for easy commuting (NE Broadway and Sandy, plus a ramp to I-84).  With neighborhood shops, restaurants, a theatre, and stores all within walking distance or nearby, Hollywood offers a nice lifestyle.%0a> %0a80,81c84,85%0a%3c !!!!'''Average Resources''' •%0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a> %0a89,103c93,98%0a%3c !!%25center%25''Omni''%0a%3c %0a%3c The Arts & Entertainment District, or previously known as Omni, is a neighborhood of greater Downtown, Miami, Florida, United States, just south of Edgewater.

By 1930, this area of Biscayne Boulevard was the home of Sears (later Burdines) Store, and the Shrine Building (which still stands at NE 14th Street and Biscayne Blvd), all of which were designed and built by the Biscayne Boulevard Company in the Art Deco architectural style. The area from NE 13th to NE 16th Street was envisioned as a high-end shopping district. By 1930, early tenants in the Shrine Building included the Piggly-Wiggly grocery store, Biscayne-Page Electric Company, and the John Turner Piano Store on the first floor. Other tenants in 1930 were the Home Drug Store and the Burroughs Adding Machine Company.%0a%3c %0a%3c In 1977, the Omni International Mall opened replacing much of the street-side stores with a suburban-style shopping mall.

The area came to be called “Riverside” for its location next to the Miami River. Mary Brickell (a member of one of Miami’s prominent pioneer families) platted the Riverside subdivision. The most important developers of the areas were the Tatum brothers, creators of the Lawrence Estate Land Company subdivision which represented a large segment of Riverside. They came to Miami from Dawson, Georgia in the late 1890s. The Tatum brothers’ advertisements characterized the area as “The Beautiful Ridge” owing to its verdant, elevated terrain close to the river. In an advertisement appearing in 1906, J.H. Tatum and company exhorted Miamians to “buy a lot in Riverside”, especially since “the electric trolley line will be completed through (Riverside) in 90 days and the price of all lots will be increased 50%25”. The Tatum’s sold lots in Riverside, in 1904 for $300 to $350. The area during its early history contained many elegant two story frame homes. As the second and third decade of the 20th century unfolded, many of the newer homes were bungalows.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Riverside area was connected to nearby downtown Miami by the 12th Street (later Flagler Street) bridge, which opened as a toll-roadway in 1905. The tolls were steep for the time: 10 cents for a pedestrian: 25 cents for a horse-drawn cart. In 1909, the City of Miami purchased the facility and removed the tolls. Broad Flagler Street was the area’s most important thoroughfare. A Flagler Street trolley began operating in 1915, carrying passengers as far west as S.W. 12th Avenue. Businesses and splendid homes arose along both sides of Flagler Street in the early 1900s. Prominent Miamians of the era lived in the Riverside area. By the 1930s, Riverside’s population was changing. Increasing number of Jews moved into the area, and many of their businesses, professional offices, and institutions accompanied them. The Jewish presence continued to grow, and remained a major element of the population until the late 1950s, when an era of postwar prosperity brought another housing boom to Greater Miami. The boom prompted many Riverside residents to suburban developments throughout Dade County.%0a%3c %0a%3c The earliest Cubans in Miami for which there are recorded information were the Eduardo Luis Gonzalez family who were here in 1896. Another early Cuban family recorded was the Encinosas, who had a home in 1922 at 120 S.W. 8th Street. By the early 20th century a significant number of Cubans already resided in the Riverside area. Riverside’s population mix has undergone many changes in recent decades as huge number of Cubans, Nicaraguans, and other Caribbean and Latin American refugees poured into the area. Because of its large Cuban population, the area began to be called Little Havana or East Little Havana.%0a%3c %0a%3c I-95, which was completed through Miami Dade County in the late 1960s was built along some of the Riverside area making an impact on the neighborhood. The area beneath I-95 close to the Miami River served as a temporary home in the summer and fall of 1980 for hundreds of Cuban refugees from the Port of Mariel. One of the most prominent landmarks of the Riverside area is the Firestone service station. It was built in 1929 under the personal supervision of Harvey Firestone, who had a mansion on Miami Beach, it was billed as the largest Firestone facility in the world and was considered Mr. Firestone's favorite store. It also sported what was at the time, the largest neon sign in Florida. Although Riverside has been transformed into a vibrant Latin Quarter and many of its historic buildings have been demolished, the Firestone structure still dominates the corner of Flagler Street and Twelfth Avenue.

Little Havana is the name affixed to a sprawling neighborhood lying immediately west of Downtown Miami. It stretches west from the Miami River for several miles. This sobriquet was applied to the Shenandoah and Riverside neighborhoods in the 1960s, following the beginnings of a vast influx of Cuban refugees there. Little Havana is famous as the cultural and political capital of Cuban Americans, and the neighborhood is a center of the Cuban exile community.%0a%3c %0a%3c In the 1960s, the NUMBER of Cubans fleeing Castro led the area to become a hotbed of counter-revolutionary activity. Arriving residents expected their stay in Miami would be temporary as Castro would be deposed. By 1970, the neighborhood was more than 85 percent Cuban.

Since 1986, the Miami Roads Neighborhood Civic Association has worked on a variety of projects to support the neighborhood.%0a%3c The Roads, originally called "Brickell Hammock" was designed, platted and developed by Mary Brickell in January 1922 days before her death. Mary Brickell had designed the Roads as a pedestrian-friendly neighborhood, with wide streets with median parkways and roundabouts with native Miami plants. Mary Brickell gave the streets, parkways, sidewalks, and electric lighting to the City of Miami in 1922. All the properties were sold in a single day on February 1, 1923.%0a%3c %0a%3c Although the homes in the Roads were originally planned to be affordable for Miamians, homes in the Roads were popular early on and quickly became one of Miami's most prestigious neighborhoods.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a%3c *%0a%3c *%0a%3c !!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Locations'''%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25''Shenandoah''%0a%3c %0a%3c Shenandoah is one of the first Neighborhoods in the City of Miami.

The "Shenandoah" area was farmland and piney wood until the real-estate boom of the 1920s, when one residential subdivision after another bearing the name "Shenandoah" as part of its title appeared. The modern borders of the neighborhood are Calle Ocho to the north, Coral Way to the south, SW 12th Ave to the east and SW 27th Ave to the west.%0a%3c %0a%3c Shenandoah is home to a large number of revivalist architecture homes and buildings, such as Shenandoah Middle School and many homes in the area closer to Calle Ocho.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a%3c *%0a%3c *%0a%3c !!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Locations'''%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25''Coral Gate''%0a%3c %0a%3c Coral Gate is a neighborhood in Miami, Florida with a population of 13,134.

There is a strong sense of community identity, and active neighborhood involvement in issues such as effectively addressing crime, traffic control, and generally improving the quality and livability of the area. Neighbor involvement and contributions recently helped in making the Rigler Community Garden a great success. The garden provides a great community gathering place, with an opportunity for children and adults to garden, and also helps provide a healthy food source for the surrounding community.  Cully offers many attractive homes, and given Portland's rising home prices, still affords a good opportunity to families and individuals who want to live in a nice urban Portland neighborhood that isn't too exorbitantly expensive.  Home styles in this area lean towards modest family homes like ranches and smaller Craftsman styles, and starter homes.  %0a%3c %0a---%0a> Cully is a neighborhood in the Northeast section of Portland, Oregon. The neighborhood, as well as NE Cully Blvd. that runs diagonally through it, is named after English stonemason Thomas Cully (1810–1891), an early settler.

Nevertheless, Cully has the smallest amount of parkland per capita, and largest population living more than one-half mile from a park, of any Portland neighborhood. The Thomas Cully Park Community Garden celebrated its grand opening on October 18, 2012.%0a> %0a> Rose City Cemetery, founded in 1906, occupies the southwest corner of the neighborhood. Within its grounds is the Japanese Cemetery, which is maintained independently by the Japanese Ancestral Society of Portland%0a> %0a63,79c67,76%0a%3c Portland's Hollywood neighborhood is located in Northeast Portland and is bordered by the Sullivan's Gulch, Irvington, Alameda, Beaumont-Wilshire and Rose City Park neighborhoods.%0a%3c %0a%3c At first glance, the Hollywood District (originally known as “Hollyrood” until 1926, when the grand Hollywood Theatre on Northeast Sandy Boulevard opened) might strike a visitor as all business and no-nonsense. It has little of the Bohemian flair found in other popular neighborhoods throughout Portland, and its two main streets (Sandy Blvd. and Northeast Broadway) are relatively high-speed thoroughfares that don't encourage pause.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The best way to appreciate Hollywood is to take to the sidewalks. A slower pace reveals a lot to like about this neighborhood.  If your tour starts as you cross over I-84, two unusual places – well, they would be unusual if this wasn't Portland – flank you on either side of Sandy Blvd. as you enter the district via its southeast corner. To your right is Tony Starlight's Supperclub & Lounge, where you may enjoy cocktails and smoky jazz and blues with the rest of the swells. A reason to bust your swanky finery out of the closet!%0a%3c %0a%3c To the left across the street is the bottle-shaped facade of what was originally Steigerwald Dairy Company in the 1920s (the bottle was later reshaped to represent 7-Up, and today it bears the Budweiser logo). This building houses two shops that appeal to the outdoor adventurer: Mountain Shop, for all things skiing, snowboarding, and climbing, and Rip City Skate, for longboards and skateboards and accessories (where you can try out the goods on their ramp in the back!).%0a%3c %0a%3c Should you have a yen (oops, make that a yuan) for Northern Chinese cuisine, stroll or briskly stride up 37th Avenue and hang a right onto NE Broadway to Shandong Restaurant and have a steaming bowl of Dragon in the Garden soup and potstickers. Sushi more your style? Bluefin Sushi Bar is for you, then (which is also on Broadway but you'll have to go back south to Sandy Blvd. and then head east and look for the Sandy/Broadway split just the other side of NE 39th; part of the Hollywood District's “charm” is it's wacky street dynamics.  If a street can have a lighthouse, then Sandy Boulevard's is the venerable Hollywood Theatre, a showcase for cinematic fare both classic and contemporary. A not-for-profit organization sees to the renovation and improvements to the grand old lady, and has volunteer opportunities and internships available for those with an itch to contribute. Please do take in a viewing and a pint and inquire.%0a%3c %0a%3c From this point you may take the crosswalk to Magnolia's Corner across the street from the theater to enjoy a glass (or a bottle) of wine, or simply walk a very few steps up to Aliviar Coffeehouse to savor a flavorful and lovingly-brewed coffee. Or take a left on 42nd Avenue and trot up to The Moon and Sixpence for a taste of Old Blighty. Cheers!%0a%3c %0a%3c Quick! Run into TigerLily Tattoo and Designworks and get that ink done that you've always wanted to dare yourself to get. Then head into Pal's Shanty Tavern to anesthetize the burn. Or maybe vice-versa, for courage?%0a%3c %0a%3c If all you really want after all is a nice walk through a neighborhood with beautiful greenery and lovely homes, just turn north. The residential areas of the Hollywood District are quiet and calm under leaf-laden trees, a very pleasant surcease after experiencing the rush and roar of the big streets. They inspire a wish to wander. And so you should.  A good mix of everyone lives, plays, eats and imbibes here. This is a walker's paradise.  This area features many older Portland homes full of character and charm.  Tree lined streets, covered porches, and families taking a stroll...  Plus, Hollywood is conveniently located along major streets for easy commuting (NE Broadway and Sandy, plus a ramp to I-84).

Although a mixed commercial and residential area, it serves primarily as a shopping district to the adjacent neighborhoods of Grant Park and Laurelhurst, as well as to riders of the MAX Light Rail System. The Hollywood District also figures in Beverly Cleary's Klickitat Street series of books, a fact memorialized in a display at the Hollywood Library, which also provides a Beverly Cleary walking tour.

The neighborhood has two markets (Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods) along with a branch of the Multnomah County Library. With neighborhood shops, restaurants, a theater, and stores all within walking distance of most homes in the neighborhood.  Here are the Census 2000 numbers: 115 acres, just over 1,000 residents, 758 households, and 85%25 of Hollywood’s residents are renters.

The Parkrose plat was filed October 5, 1911. A branch post office of Portland was established there in 1921. Parkrose was a small farming and residential suburb of Portland until the 1920s. The Oregon Journal noted on May 23, 1925, "Parkrose is a primary commuting center... It is one of the most progressive and promising commuting districts on the eastern border of the city."  Parkrose was annexed by Portland, and the community was enumerated as a "Census-designated place" in 1980, when the community recorded a population of 21,108. There is a Parkrose / Sumner Transit Center, which is served by the Red Line of TriMet's MAX Light Rail. A bridge at the transit center spans Interstate 205.

Nevertheless, Cully has the smallest amount of parkland per capita, and largest population living more than one-half mile from a park, of any Portland neighborhood. The Thomas Cully Park Community Garden celebrated its grand opening on October 18, 2012.%0a%3c %0a%3c Rose City Cemetery, founded in 1906, occupies the southwest corner of the neighborhood.

Although a mixed commercial and residential area, it serves primarily as a shopping district to the adjacent neighborhoods of Grant Park and Laurelhurst, as well as to riders of the MAX Light Rail System. The Hollywood District also figures in Beverly Cleary's Klickitat Street series of books, a fact memorialized in a display at the Hollywood Library, which also provides a Beverly Cleary walking tour. The first pedestrian crossing light in Oregon was installed in the Hollywood District, across the street from the Hollywood theater.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Hollywood District was originally part of the Rose City Park subdivision which was platted in 1907. The original Rose City Park subdivision was part of the Donation Land Claim of Joseph Backenstos. The land was later assigned to his widow by President Andrew Johnson in 1866. 1890s-era maps refer to the area as the Crook Tract.%0a%3c %0a%3c In the 20th century, the now-defunct Rodgers store chain had its headquarters (as well as its largest store) in the Hollywood District from 1955 to 1984. The Hollywood District is home to the Hollywood Farmers Market, a year-round Saturday farmers' market located on NE Hancock Street between 44th and 45th Avenues, which runs weekly from April through November, and twice-monthly from December through March.[4] The Hollywood Boosters started "Hollywood at Night" in summer of 2006. This is a monthly neighborhood event that takes place on the third Thursday of every month to bring together residents and local businesses%0a%3c %0a%3c The Hollywood neighborhood is a mix of commercial and residential space and provides shopping for many of the surrounding neighborhoods such as Grant Park and Laurelhurst, as well as to riders of the MAX Light Rail System. Hollywood also figures in Beverly Cleary’s Klickitat Street series of books, a fact memorialized in a display at the neighborhood library. Details on a Beverly Cleary walking tour are available at the library.%0a%3c %0a%3c Hollywood is conveniently located along major streets for easy commuting (NE Broadway and Sandy, plus a ramp to I-84). You can catch the flavor of the area by driving diagonally from southwest to northwest on NE Sandy Boulevard starting at NE 37th Avenue and you will exit the neighborhood on NE 47th Avenue.  The neighborhood has two markets (Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods) along with a branch of the Multnomah County Library. With neighborhood shops, restaurants, a theater, and stores all within walking distance of most homes in the neighborhood.  Here are the Census 2000 numbers: 115 acres, just over 1,000 residents, 758 households, and 85%25 of Hollywood’s residents are renters.  Assuming that most of the renters live in apartment buildings, this means that the neighborhood has about 115 housing units that are owner-occupied. In a typical year, only 10-15 homes are sold in the neighborhood.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

The Parkrose plat was filed October 5, 1911. A branch post office of Portland was established there in 1921. Parkrose was a small farming and residential suburb of Portland until the 1920s. The Oregon Journal noted on May 23, 1925, "Parkrose is a primary commuting center... It is one of the most progressive and promising commuting districts on the eastern border of the city."  Parkrose was annexed by Portland, and the community was enumerated as a "Census-designated place" in 1980, when the community recorded a population of 21,108. There is a Parkrose / Sumner Transit Center, which is served by the Red Line of TriMet's MAX Light Rail. A bridge at the transit center spans Interstate 205. C-Tran serves the transit center and travels into Washington. There is also a Parkrose School District.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

It borders Beaumont-Wilshire and the Hollywood District on the west (at NE 47th Avenue), Cully on the north (at NE Fremont Street), Roseway and Madison South on the east (at NE 65th Avenue), and Center on the south (at the Banfield Expressway and MAX transit line).%0a%3c %0a%3c The neighborhood is also located next to the Rose City Golf course, the second oldest municipal course in the city of Portland. Built in 1923, the course is a classic, tree-lined course that is both playable and challenging for players at all levels. Built in 1932, the clubhouse at Rose City is a beautiful, brick building with steep pitched roofs. The clubhouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. The grill area serves breakfast and lunch along with snacks.%0a%3c %0a%3c In July 2008, Forbes Magazine named Rose City Park the ninth most overpriced neighborhood in the country. This was based on a price-to-earnings spread comparing rental costs with buying costs for similar properties, based on the number of bedrooms, location, and price per square foot. A neighborhood with a high price-to-earnings spread is considered overvalued because a buyer is getting a low return based on costs and paying a huge premium to live in area relative to how much it would cost to rent a similar property there.%0a%3c %0a%3c That may discourage you from buying a home in Rose City Park but if you look at some numbers you may change your mind. The 5-year median sales price change from 2008 to 2012 was just -1%25. The time period was a period of declining house values in the Portland metro area housing market but Rose City Park homes held their value well.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

The city's increased presence within the cultural lexicon has established it as a popular city for young people, and it was second only to Louisville, Kentucky as one of the cities to attract and retain the highest number of college-educated people in the United States.[46] Between 2001 and 2012, Portland's gross domestic product per person grew fifty percent, more than any other city in the country.%0a%3c %0a%3c The city has acquired a diverse range of nicknames throughout its history, though it is most often called "Rose City" or "The City of Roses", the latter of which has been its unofficial nickname since 1888 and its official nickname since 2003. Another widely used nickname by local residents in everyday speech is "PDX", which is also the airport code for Portland International Airport. Other nicknames include Bridgetown, Stumptown, Rip City, Soccer City, P-Town, Portlandia, and the more antiquated Little Beirut.%0a%3c %0a%3c Portland is often awarded "Greenest City in America" and similar designations. Popular Science awarded Portland the title of the Greenest City in America in 2008, and Grist magazine listed it in 2007 as the second greenest city in the world. The city became a pioneer of state-directed metropolitan planning, a program which was instituted statewide in 1969 to compact the urban growth boundaries of the city.%0a---%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
