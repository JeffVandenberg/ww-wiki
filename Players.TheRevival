Whether it’s through Brother Jerry’s raucous revival services, Lorekeeper Anna’s thoughtful research, or Dame Annelise’s artistic endeavors the coterie urges the Kindred of Miami to embrace their Damnation and the divine purpose God has bestowed upon the Damned.   %0a%0aOf course the group is not purely spiritual.

No matter what the topic, they are always highly theatrical and lively events.  Serpent handling, pyrotechnics, frenzies, and blood feasts are just some of tools they have employed to bring the message of Damnation home to Miami's Kindred.  %0a%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25vampire%25'''Locations'''%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=0px width=330  margin-right=10px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=0px newwin%25https://i.pinimg.com/564x/32/0e/29/320e2998b08fafc4491e975684731cda.jpg%0a%0a'''Church of the Precious Blood'''%0a%0aNestled in what may be considered the more backwoods part of Miami is an older, rust red church that has recently been purchased. The grounds provide ample parking and a few picnic tables for after-service gatherings. There is also an area in the back of the property that can be used for outdoors services in nicer weather.  Additionally in the back of the property, opposite the outdoor service area, is a matching house  - presumably where the preacher resides. %0a%0aMost notable is the symbol of the Radiant Cross, painted in blood upon the old wooden cross that hangs above the pulpit.  The symbol always looks and smells of fresh blood, but cannot be wiped away, nor can any Kindred feed upon it.  A divine sign, the Revival says, a sign of God's blessing upon their work.%0a%0a'''Public Effects'''%0a%0a* Safe Place: 1%0a* Haven: 1%0a*Repository 2 (Kindred Theology)%0a%0a'''Sanctuary House'''%0a%0aPrivate in its own little corner of Surfside, the decrepit looking Italian villa is crumbling apart.

As Kindred evangelists, they focus on bringing new Kindred into the church or failing that, brining about a spiritual awakening in members of the other more temporal covenants (and thus at least partially aligning them with the Church).  The group uses both personal one on one methods and large, lively services to spread their message of the peace and resolve that only a knowing your divine purpose can bring.   %0a> %0a> !!!!%25vampire%25 ''Tollison Creed Ascends (Lancea):''  %0a> The Tollison Creed is recognized and tolerated within the Lancea, but it currently is the least important of the three major creeds.  The Revival seeks to change that.  Whether its to bring an end to "the last remnants of mortal papist influences" or simply part of a larger power play isn't always clear.  The coterie is happy to work with other Lancea regardless of Creed, but as they attract more and more members, they fully intend to convert those numbers into position, influence, and power within the Second Estate.%0a> %0a102,103c102,103%0a%3c Not all of the group's focus is purely on the divine.

The Kindred of the Revival live in the world of danse macabre and it would be perilous to ignore that fact.  Fortunately, as they cast a wide net in their evangelizing efforts, it allows them to cast an equally wide net for influence.  They are interested in seeing members gain influence in all the mortal spheres.  Such diversity allows them to better help each other and potential new recruits.  And makes them attractive allies to the other, more temporal factions of Miami's Kindred.  %0a> %0a117c117%0a%3c %25vampire%25"It is beyond dispute this world has fallen into darkness and needs a revival.

That often leads to recruitment to the Lancea, but not always.  It is possible to embrace the doctrine of Damnation and still belong to the Invictus or the Movement, perhaps even the Ordo, but never the Circle.  The members of the Revival often serve as spiritual mentors and advisors to other Kindred.  %0a> %0a> Despite its heavenly goals and work, some critics might also say the Revival is not about glorifying God, but about glorifying itself.  Particularly its founder, Brother Jerry.  And they do not always limit themselves to spiritual guidance, sometimes branching out into political and other secular matters.  %0a43c42,44%0a%3c Services are very much modeled on a combination of backwoods mystics, charismatic Pentacostal services, and modern mega churches.

Kindred may be encouraged to fast before coming to service.  The Beast is often compared to the Holy Spirit, as a sort of dark Kindred version of that. Tithes are collected in blood and are used in baptisms (if there are any).  Services always end with an altar call, inviting Kindred to step forward and committ themselves to the work of Longius. %0a

That often leads to recruitment to the Lancea, but not always.  It is possible to embrace the doctrine of Damnation and still belong to the Invictus or the Movement, perhaps even the Ordo, but never the Circle.  The members of the Revival often serve as spiritual mentors and advisors to other Kindred.  %0a%3c %0a%3c Despite its heavenly goals and work, some critics might also say the Revival is not about glorifying God, but about glorifying itself.  Particularly its founder, Brother Jerry.  And they do not always limit themselves to spiritual guidance, sometimes branching out into political and other secular matters.  %0a---%0a> %0a

Kindred may be encouraged to fast before coming to service.  The Beast is often compared to the Holy Spirit, as a sort of dark Kindred version of that.

As Kindred evangelists, they focus on bringing new Kindred into the church or failing that, brining about a spiritual awakening in members of the other more temporal covenants (and thus at least partially aligning them with the Church).  The group uses both personal one on one methods and large, lively services to spread their message of the peace and resolve that only a knowing your divine purpose can bring.   %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25vampire%25 ''Tollison Creed Ascends (Lancea):''  %0a%3c The Tollison Creed is recognized and tolerated within the Lancea, but it currently is the least important of the three major creeds.  The Revival seeks to change that.  Whether its to bring an end to "the last remnants of mortal papist influences" or simply part of a larger power play isn't always clear.  The coterie is happy to work with other Lancea regardless of Creed, but as they attract more and more members, they fully intend to convert those numbers into position, influence, and power within the Second Estate.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25vampire%25 ''In The World, Even If Not Of It (Kindred):'' %0a%3c Not all of the group's focus is purely on the divine.  The Kindred of the Revival live in the world of danse macabre and it would be perilous to ignore that fact.  Fortunately, as they cast a wide net in their evangelizing efforts, it allows them to cast an equally wide net for influence.  They are interested in seeing members gain influence in all the mortal spheres.  Such diversity allows them to better help each other and potential new recruits.  And makes them attractive allies to the other, more temporal factions of Miami's Kindred.  %0a%3c %0a%3c    %0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c (:div2end:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:cellnr width=100%25:)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25vampire%25'''Quotes'''%0a%3c %0a%3c "And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.” - Mark 16:17-18%0a%3c %0a%3c %25mortal%25 "I am a quote!
