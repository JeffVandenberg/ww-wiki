The wood is warped and discolored, the lower windows are broken out and boarded over.  It definitely looks like something from a horror movie.  The impression only increases when anyone gets a good look at the strange plants that overgrow everywhere around the house.  Not many get such a close look but there are rumors of the lights that are sometimes seen inside the sunken house.%0a---%0a> %25burnt orange%25 Swamp Monster (Everyone) - %25white%25She does stuff in a swamp.  Mostly occulty stuff.%0a

If you want a background hook with her you have lots of choices.  You can have memories of her that she seems to have no memory of, or she can have memories of you that you have no memory of.  This is especially a hook for vampires, as these memories are mostly of pre-80's times.%0a

Her fashion sense is eclectic and usually features very feminine prints in outdated, yet charming styles.  %0a%3c %0a%3c Nosferatu Curse:  Caught in the peripheral vision, she always looks feral, with glowing red eyes and fangs descended.  A slobbering beast ready to tear out your heart.  It's enough to strike an instinctive fight or flight response, however, as soon as you directly look at her her expression is serene and her beauty undeniable.  Her shadow moves in uncomfortable ways, by only when not looking directly at it.  Head-on its as normal a shadow as anyone else's.  It gives constant, low-key jump scares when you aren't quite paying attention but any direct scrutiny reveals nothing amiss.%0a%3c ----%0a%3c ----%0a%3c !%25burnt orange%25  Hooks%0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=17px margin-right=16px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=8px width=315 newwin%25https://i.imgur.com/wykHccW.jpg%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25burnt orange%25 Swamp Monster (Everyone) - %25white%25She does stuff in a swamp.
