'''+Appearance+'''%0a-----%0aEmilia is a short young woman, standing around 5’3”, with dark brown hair and blue eyes that hold an intense, inscrutable, gaze. There’s a porcelain vulnerability to her pale, unblemished, skin that is at odds with her supreme composure and calm, collected, demeanor. When she speaks it is with a prominent English accent, specifically London for those with an ear for such things. %0a\\\%0a%0a!! '''+Roleplay Hooks+'''%0a-----%0a'''Weird Even For Portland:''' Sometimes she seems to be having a conversation with no one, sometimes she spends long stretches of time staring at an empty space, sometimes she spontaneously laughs when nothing remotely funny has happened. Both those Uratha marked by the Crescent Moon and those who follow Siskur-Dah’s path are considered a bit odd, together even more so.%0a%0a'''The Witch of Londinium:''' Emilia is a young woman who is obsessed with the magical and strange. She’s traveled far and the city of Portland is fascinating to her, especially with its particularly unusual society of supernatural beings. If there is an air of the unknown or the mysterious about you, expect Ms. King to ask a few questions.%0a%0a'''Ghostbuster:''' Even as a child, Emilia was able to perceive the lingering spirits of the deceased. Whether they are mere echoes or remnants of a human soul, she wants to better understand them. However, should they prove malicious, she will not hesitate to use tooth and claw to send their shrieking spectral forms to the Underworld.%0a%0a'''Aspiring Ritemaster:''' As an Ithaeur, Emilia takes her role as a leader of ceremonies and important Uratha rituals seriously. She has learned a few sacred rites but she is constantly on the search for more.%0a%0a'''King Princess:''' The similarities in appearance may not be immediately apparent unless she is in the same room with her brothers but Emilia is a member of the King family. Specifically, she is Everett and Desmond King’s youngest sister.%0a%0a'''Destiny’s Child:''' For those who can sense such things, be they fate witches or simply marked by the fickle forces of fortune, there is something unusual about Emilia King. Destiny clings to her waiting to be realized. What that destiny might be? That remains unclear for now. %0a\\\%0a%0a!! '''+History+'''%0a-----%0aEmilia is not especially forthcoming about her own history, at least not anymore than most people. She grew up in Great Britain in the city of London. Even at a young age, she was particularly sensitive to the spiritual realm on the other side of the Gauntlet that left her ostracized by her peers. Thankfully, she had plenty of company in the form of spirits, ghosts, and even stranger creatures that inhabited the Shadow. Eventually, the youngest daughter of the King family went through her First Change underneath the crescent moon to the surprise of no one. Given her auspice and her particular inclinations, she joined the Bone Shadows tribe and learned to become a shaman before coming to the States. %0a\\\%0a%0a%0a!!
