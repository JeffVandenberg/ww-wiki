Beneath a straight and knife like nose are sultry lips. The bottom lip is slightly fuller than the top. His eyebrows come to sharp points, as they carve down towards his high cheekbones. With his dark skin it is hard not to notice that this man is of Romani blood. Much like his skin his eyes have are dark, but in the right light a bit of brown can be detected. His body is lithe and strong.  His body language is sultry in movement and pose, but when examined closely there is a playful predator skulking there.%0a!!!!!TRUE FACE:%0aThe long black locks no longer flow with curls, but rather hang in life dry strands. His face shrinks quite a bit from lack of moisture, especially around the eyes. There are dark circles around his eyes. The fullness of his lips sinks away to chapped husks of their former glory. The Romani in him can't be robbed by his true face. It might be paler and dry, but there is still a dark tan that can't be lost. Brown pupils that refuse to dilate sink back into his sockets.
