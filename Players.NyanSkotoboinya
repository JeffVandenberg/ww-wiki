She is THE social juggernaut of the Lost community and she proves it by regularly hobnobbing with the other societal monsters of the darkness, those that are known for their charming ways, and some that aren&rsquo;t. One would think that she would have jumped at the chance to be an ambassador at the Embassy, but when asked about it all Nyan does is give off the barest of shrugs – not interested, it would seem.%0a%3c %0a%3c  %0a%3c Hers was the party that never ended, both in the mortal world before her durance and the durance itself, and that’s all she tends to say about the affair. Further questions may or may not lend to the questioner becoming something of a pet project until Nyan gets bored and something you never want to experience is Nyan when she&rsquo;s bored. She’s only been a “queen” for three years, but so far the Court of Beruit has prospered under her, and it shows no sign of wilting anytime soon; if anything it’s developed a harder edge that some whisper is in part due to her Russian personality.%0a%3c There have been whirlwind parties where some are broken by the wheel and others achieve enlightenment by way of her otherworldly mixes.%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
