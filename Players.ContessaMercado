This has resulted in a very big and family-oriented atmosphere. Maybe you know one of her relatives. Maybe you ARE a relative. Contessa's immediate family members are spread out among the three converted apartments above MME but they always manage to find room for friends and other family members who may be in need. %0a%3c %0a%3c ((If you're interested in being an immediate family member or other related relative feel free to hit me up for more info!!))%0a
