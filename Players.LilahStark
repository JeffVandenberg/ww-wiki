Description%0a%0aShe’s an attractive woman in her mid-twenties, tall, curvy, and obviously in good shape, with pale skin, dark eyes, favoring simple but dramatic makeup. Her hair is a striking blue shot through with vivid green. Her clothing tends towards some combination of dark, tight, and low-cut, with tight t-shirts from various heavy metal bands and road-worn jeans favored, along with battered old boots and, weather permitting, leather jackets. She also tends towards a wide variety of jewelry - pendants on leather thongs, lockets on steel chains, black leather bracelets, bangles in various colors. She’s quick to smile and laugh, and something about her voice comes across as quite reassuring.%0a%0a----%0a%0a!! Hooks%0a%0a*The (Tattoo) Artist: She’s a talented tattoo artist, currently working for a little shop but with dreams of opening her own one day. To do that, she needs a portfolio.

She’s as likely to be seen at an intimate acoustic performance as she is at a heavy metal show, despite a loud preference for the latter. Have you bumped into one another at a concert?%0a%0a*Storyteller - She loves to tell stories and swap them for new ones. Anything is fair game, from goofy shaggy dog stories to intensely personal stories of heartbreak and woe. Have you swapped tales before?%0a----%0a%0a!!
