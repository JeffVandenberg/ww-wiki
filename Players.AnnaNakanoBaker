She stands just at five feet, or a bit above as she claims, and weighs a little extra. She has green eyes and dark brown, almost black, straight medium length hair. At first glance, much to her own displeasure, one may mistake her for a teenager or a child - the bane of her professional career. She has a slight southern accent which she does her best to hide, only really becoming pronounced when she becomes irritated (leading to her being taken less seriously) or overjoyed. %0a%3c %0a%3c Her small stature has made her unafraid of just butting in, speaking up, or otherwise being viewed as "aggressive", it is either that or be completely ignored. This does make her appear to have a "short-temper" at times, but more stemming from always having to be forceful just to be given some respect. However, she would at times prefer to be less forceful and direct with people but those are rare given sometimes her own students remarks regarding her child-like appearance.%0a%3c %0a%3c !! %25mortal%25 '''+Public History+'''%0a%3c ----%0a%3c '''Anna''', despite her appearance, is a third generation immigrant but shares little connection to her roots aside from her looks and her name. She recently moved from the Northeast, having finished her doctoral degree at MIT, to the Miami area to start her Post-Doc fellowship. Originally she is from somewhere in the "south" and is no more specific about her past than that - focusing more on the present and future. Publicly she is known in academic spheres for her work in biochemistry and examining potentially new ways to create synthetic blood. Less known is her work regarding more "bizarre" methods of research or "unorthodox" interests into matters not totally connected to modern science.%0a%3c %0a%3c !! %25mortal%25 '''+Roleplaying Hooks+'''%0a%3c -----%0a%3c !!!!! %25mortal%25 '''Post Doc Researcher''' (Students, Researchers, Professors, Anyone):%0a%3c %25%25 Anna teaches classes at the university regarding general biology for undergraduates and upper biochemistry for graduate and doctoral students. If you attend the university you may have been to one of her classes, heard one of her lectures, or seen her walking about.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!! %25mortal%25 '''Researcher of the Strange''' (Markus Kincaid, Occult, Anyone):%0a%3c %25%25 Anna has always had a strong and strange fascination with the occult, trinkets, and old tomes. All the knowledge of the past couldn't have all been purely superstition and folktales - some elements of truth have to lay hidden in them, right?%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!! %25mortal%25 '''Hospital Bound''' (Medical, Anyone):%0a%3c %25%25 Having been born with weakened physical abilities, partly responsible for her small stature, Anna may often be found having regular check-ups at the hospital. Further, despite bad memories and experiences associated with them she also takes time to occasionally volunteer at them.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!! %25mortal%25 '''Out of Place''' (Anyone):%0a%3c %25%25 Anna can get odd looks when she walks into bars, nightclubs, and places generally reserved for adults, getting carded is a constant struggle. It wouldn't be strange if you had made a note of the child drinking in the bar the last time you were there or some other place a "child" shouldn't be.%0a%3c %0a%3c (:tableend:)%0a%3c %0a%3c !! %25mortal%25 '''+Trusted Friends and Contacts+'''%0a%3c -----%0a%3c Those remarkable people who Anna have the privilege and joy to call friends and colleagues! %0a%3c %0a%3c (:cellnr width=50%25 align=left style='padding-left: 0px;':)%0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center width=180 margin-top=0px margin-right=7px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=8px newwin%25 [[https://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/Players/AnaMarielaCastillo|https://i.imgur.com/MGxu49A.jpg]] %25mortal%25 '''John Doe:'''%0a%3c %0a%3c %25mortal%25 Placeholder for someone I've yet to meet.%0a%3c %0a%3c (:cell width=50%25 align=left style='padding-right: 0px;':)%0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center width=180 margin-top=0px margin-right=7px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=8px newwin%25 [[https://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/Players/AnaMarielaCastillo|https://i.imgur.com/XeLNVMs.jpg]]  %25mortal%25 '''Jane Doe:'''%0a%3c %0a%3c %25mortal%25 Placeholder for someone I've yet to meet.%0a%3c %0a%3c (:tableend:)%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!! %25mortal%25 Quotes:%0a%3c %0a%3c "''No one has left a mark, yet, will you be the first?"'' -  Unknown%0a%3c %0a%3c (:tableend:)%0a%3c ----%0a%3c (:keywords mortal, PC:)%0a%3c (:include GameRef.Directoryplayermortal:)%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
