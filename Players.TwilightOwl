The door (locked) enters into a normal sort of stairwell that leads down to a separate door that is also locked. Those who have gained admittance are provided a small key to keep on their person to use at any time. Past the two sets of doors is a small hallway with the final door that is generally left open.

There are unisex bathrooms, solitary as one might expect, a kitchen with a standard fridge, and plenty of counter space. It does not hold a stove top or an oven built in, but instead is meant to acquire smaller, portable appliances to be used.  There is plenty of liquor already in store.

Those who may be connected to the supernatural species may be allowed in (wolfblood, etc), but their kin are not. Escorting those not allowed into the establishment warrants expulsion, either temporary or permanent.%0a%0aAdmittance to the Twilight Owl requires a test, of sorts, currently only administered by the proprietress. It involves a 1 time (ideally) consumption of the person's ephemera, in an effort for Brielle to examine it. Once a successful examination has been completed (ideally the first time, though on an off day she may require another attempt), the individual  documents their name in a book that is locked and hidden within the establishment for the security of its members. Once documented, the individual is provided a key for the first two doors.%0a%0aAll materials within the establishment are to be kept in such a place, especially the library materials. This is to encourage individuals to provide whatever information they locate without fear of reprisal from their supernatural kin, should they have any. Additionally, sharing of information such as:%0a%0aMember status%0aMember capabilities%0aTopics or conversations between members in such a space%0a%0aIs strictly prohibited unless expressed permission is provided by those affected.
