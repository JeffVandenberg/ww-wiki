In 1853, when Henry was 19, he headed west on the Oregon Trail to seek his fortune. A year later, his future wife Georgiana Burton (c.1845-1918) left Missouri with her family and headed west as well. When Henry and Georgiana arrived in the area, Portland was a frontier “stumptown” competing with Oregon City to become the major trade and industrial center for the region.%0a%0aHenry found work as a typesetter at The Oregonian at a time when the newspaper industry was financially risky and fiercely competitive. More than 30 newspapers were launched in Portland during this period. On June 20, 1860, Henry and Georgiana married and five months later, he was given ownership of the paper in exchange for back wages. Henry went on to transform The Oregonian into a successful daily newspaper that is still printed today.%0a%0a%0aWhile best known for being a successful newspaper publisher, Henry Pittock also built a financial empire by investing in real estate, banking, railroads, steamboats, sheep ranching, silver mining, and the paper industry. He was an avid outdoorsman, bicycle enthusiast, and was among the first group to climb Mount Hood. Georgiana Pittock became a founder and fundraiser for many charities and cultural organizations, such as the Ladies Relief Society, Women’s Union, and the Martha Washington Home, a residence for single, self-supporting women.%0a%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=25px margin-right=25px width=250px height=250px%25http://www.portlandwalkingtours.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pittock.jpg%0aIt wasn’t until the early 1900s that Henry Pittock started planning his “mansion on the hill” on property that had panoramic views of Portland, the Willamette River, and the distant Cascade Mountains. Construction began in 1912 and Henry and Georgiana moved into the home in 1914 with eight other members of the family. The couple only lived in the Mansion for roughly four years before they died. Family continued to live in the home into the 1950s. The last residents, grandson Peter Gantenbein and his father, Edward, moved out in 1958 and put the Mansion up for sale%0a%0aThe Mansion sat empty for four years and was hit by the Columbus Day Storm on October 12, 1962. Hurricane-force winds damaged roof tiles and window panes which then allowed water to infiltrate the Mansion. By 1964, the Mansion was in poor condition and developers expressed interest in tearing it down and turning the estate into a subdivision. Dedicated citizens of Portland rallied and assisted the City in raising the funds to purchase the property for $225,000, which included $67,500 raised by citizens.%0a%0aThe work needed to restore the Mansion and transform it from a private residence to a public space took 15 months. In 1965, Pittock Mansion opened to the public as a historic house museum.%0a%0aIn 1968, the nonprofit Pittock Mansion Society was formed to take on the responsibility of furnishing the Mansion, taking care of the collection, and providing educational activities.%0a%0a%0aIn 2007, the Society took over the day-to-day museum operations from Portland Parks & Recreation and has been operating the historic house museum ever since.%0a%0aThe Pittock Mansion Society is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization whose mission is to inspire understanding and stewardship of Portland history through Pittock Mansion. The Society also works with Portland Parks & Recreation to maintain and preserve the historic buildings. All admissions, memberships, donations, grants, and museum store purchases go to support Pittock Mansion and its mission.%0a%0a----%0a'''In popular media'''%0a*The mansion made its first known appearance in the 1977 romance film First Love, starring Susan Dey and William Katt. The house was the main character's family home and had an important scene in this film.%0a%0a*The second appearance was in the 1982 slasher film Unhinged. The film has become infamous since its release due to being banned in various countries as a video nasty. The house is used as the main location in the film and is used prominently throughout. The people of the city of Portland are thanked gratefully during the end credits for their participation during the films's production.%0a%0a*This location was used in the 1989 movie, The Haunting of Sarah Hardy starring Sela Ward and Morgan Fairchild.
