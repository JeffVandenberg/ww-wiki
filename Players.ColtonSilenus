The 7'2 mask does its best, but he always seems to be about to bump his head into anything remotely dangling from the ceiling. The rest of it could have come off some sort of steamy pirate fantasy book - the long curly locks flowing over shoulders, the oddly veiny bulging arms, the strange blue and green set of heterochromatic eyes. His facial hair seems always perfect, and his wide nose seems to fit well above his constant slight smile.%0a%0a%25color=#7F2E41%25It would almost be charming, until you got close enough and smelled the deep hit of alcohol on his breath like he's come off a year-long bender. The deep-seated smell of wine is all around him, and it clings to his bright bohemian clothing choices long after he parts ways with it. His blue eye never ''quite'' meets yours when the green does. The scars on his arms are raised up and many telling all sorts of stories of blades, of teeth, of bullets... And not to mention the track marks. %0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a!!!%25left%25https://i.imgur.com/nUG8R51.png%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=5px lframe width=375px bgcolor=#E4C1D0 border='5px solid black' padding=2px%25https://66.media.tumblr.com/40b45dfdd8c25eede836faf60e9c61cc/tumblr_owbg9ylS8q1rferqxo2_1280.jpg%0a%25color=#5D8236%25Silenus towers when the scales are lifted from one's eyes to see the truth. The gigantic man could almost be many things. The horns seem to say satyr, but the horse hooves say centaur. The long elven ears would claim him for those fair beings, but the vines crawling across his arms, crisscrossed with so many cuts like someone had tried to hack his way through the man with a machete tell a much different story. The blue eye seems to hold some sapphire shrapnel that he seems to not mind even if it doesn't let his eye close all the way. %0a%0a%25color=#7F2E41%25The elemental seems almost a mishmash of many other disparate elements at first until one can catch their favorite drink or fume under the near miasma of other such scents wafting around from him. When he bleeds and there's a fine wine exposed to the air, the poison seems much more obvious. Touch with caution.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/XO3cAv1.png%0a%0a%25color=#5D8236%25The former centaur's mantle is a subtle thing.
