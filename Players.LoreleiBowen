Passion without self control is folly.&rdquo; - [[Archie Putnam]]%0a* &ldquo;I adore her. Wholly and absolutely adore her. I hope with all my heart she finds what she needs. If she finds it in the congregation, that&rsquo;ll be great, but I really just hope she finds it.&rdquo; - [[Maia]]%0a* &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a sweet kid in there. If she learns that you can&rsquo;t overcome darkness by repressing darkness I think she&rsquo;ll be okay. If you tell anyone I said that part about her being sweet I&rsquo;ll bind angry poltergeists to your underpants, bee tee dubs.&rdquo; - [[The Deranged Sex Hobo She Met One Time]]%0a* &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got brains, she&rsquo;s got balls, and she&rsquo;s got passion.  Fuck we could put her on a Carthian recruitment poster.  She&rsquo;s also young and has a lot to learn still, but bein&rsquo; young has its upsides too.  We old fucks forget what its like to be new and naïve and full of unrealistic ideals.  The young remind us of all that shit and we should thank &lsquo;em for it.&rdquo; -  [[Harvey Wallson]]%0a* &ldquo;When I say you are different, it is a compliment. It may be too late for me, but a part of me is hoping you find your cure Miss Lorelei.&rdquo; - [[Esme]]%0a* &ldquo;I can say I&rsquo;ve seen and heard it all, in my what - second full week of knowing anything? A vegan vampire! It&rsquo;s amazing. Lorelei is so sweet, and willing to help people understand. Really understand. Not that victorian penny novel bullhockey, so that&rsquo;s nice. I like her. I&rsquo;d hang out with her. I hope I get to&hellip;&rdquo; - [[Olivia]]%0a* &ldquo;Collect all the pieces of a life; the blue shards of sadness, the green slivers of envy, the yellow bits of joy, and the red blocks of anger.  What do you have?  One hell of a beautiful stain glass window to the soul.&rdquo; -  [[Fujin]]%0a* &ldquo;I think&hellip;she could  be truly terrifying if she embraced her darkness a bit, she wants to stay so very pure, but..this world will never let her stay that way, but..maybe, maybe she can make her own place of purity, it&rsquo;d take flirting with the darkness, but I think she could do it. And..I&rsquo;d be happy to help.&rdquo; -  [[Korey]]%0a* &ldquo;Lorelei continues to surprise me, but in a good way.  I approve of her wardrobe change and her choice of Sire. I believe under Harvey she will continue to flourish and she doesn&rsquo;t realize it yet but, she got two mentors for the price of one.&rdquo; - [[Esme]]%0a* &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach ya everything ya need to know, hon.

Passion without self control is folly.â€ - Archie Putnam%0a%3c     â€œI adore her. Wholly and absolutely adore her. I hope with all my heart she finds what she needs. If she finds it in the congregation, thatâ€™ll be great, but I really just hope she finds it.â€ - Maia%0a%3c     â€œThereâ€™s a sweet kid in there. If she learns that you canâ€™t overcome darkness by repressing darkness I think sheâ€™ll be okay. If you tell anyone I said that part about her being sweet Iâ€™ll bind angry poltergeists to your underpants, bee tee dubs.â€ - The Deranged Sex Hobo She Met One Time%0a%3c     â€œSheâ€™s got brains, sheâ€™s got balls, and sheâ€™s got passion. Fuck we could put her on a Carthian recruitment poster. Sheâ€™s also young and has a lot to learn still, but beinâ€™ young has its upsides too. We old fucks forget what its like to be new and naÃ¯ve and full of unrealistic ideals. The young remind us of all that shit and we should thank â€˜em for it.â€ - Harvey Wallson%0a%3c     â€œWhen I say you are different, it is a compliment. It may be too late for me, but a part of me is hoping you find your cure Miss Lorelei.â€ - Esme%0a%3c     â€œI can say Iâ€™ve seen and heard it all, in my what - second full week of knowing anything? A vegan vampire! Itâ€™s amazing. Lorelei is so sweet, and willing to help people understand. Really understand. Not that victorian penny novel bullhockey, so thatâ€™s nice. I like her. Iâ€™d hang out with her. I hope I get toâ€¦â€ - Olivia%0a%3c     â€œCollect all the pieces of a life; the blue shards of sadness, the green slivers of envy, the yellow bits of joy, and the red blocks of anger. What do you have? One hell of a beautiful stain glass window to the soul.â€ - Fujin%0a%3c     â€œI thinkâ€¦she could be truly terrifying if she embraced her darkness a bit, she wants to stay so very pure, but..this world will never let her stay that way, but..maybe, maybe she can make her own place of purity, itâ€™d take flirting with the darkness, but I think she could do it. And..Iâ€™d be happy to help.â€ - Korey%0a%3c     â€œLorelei continues to surprise me, but in a good way. I approve of her wardrobe change and her choice of Sire. I believe under Harvey she will continue to flourish and she doesnâ€™t realize it yet but, she got two mentors for the price of one.â€ - Esme%0a%3c     â€œIâ€™ll teach ya everything ya need to know, hon. And probably a lotta shit ya shouldnâ€™t know.â€ - Harvey Wallson%0a%3c     â€œWhat a fire cracker! She is favored in A Favored house.â€ - Grey%0a%3c     â€œA proactive citizen who acts intelligently in challenging situations, from what I can tell. Very promising.â€ - Sheriff Martin%0a%3c     â€œShe an itch Ah canâ€™t seem ta scratch. Ah get what she doinâ€™, Ah jes canâ€™t think a reason as ta whyâ€¦ But Ahâ€™m gonna enjoy tryinâ€™ ta find out.â€ - The Prettiest Man You Know%0a%3c     â€œSheâ€™s a vicious little bitch.â€ - Plain Jane?%0a%3c     â€œShe can throw a party, she can throw a punch, and she took enough drugs to bring down an elephant and slept it off. There are some people in the city I consistently check up on. Miss Bowen will no longer be one of them.â€ - The Vick who can Hang%0a%3c     â€œLorelei? I donâ€™t really got much to say. Sheâ€™s turning into one of them, I guess. Good for her?â€ â€” Jackson%0a%3c     â€œLorelei has since grown on me. I now consider her a dear enough friend to seriously consider getting her a dinosaur.â€ - The goddess%0a%3c     â€œ Lorelei always seems like she attracts every person in the room to be around her. I never really understood it, until I won the bid for a date night. Sheâ€™s pretty awesome. Now, if only I can do something about the whole being dead thing.â€ - Kelly %0a%3c %0a%3c A Very Carthian Halloween%0a%3c Directory: Vampire the Requiem%0a%3c About the Venue%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
