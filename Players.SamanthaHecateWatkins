Usually appearing with her head buried in a book or looking down at her hands even in groups or in conversation. %0a%0aTypically seen wearing skirt suits or sweaters with knee length skirts, stockings and professional shoes. A pentacle always worn around her neck, worn proudly and in plain view of anyone that cared to look.
