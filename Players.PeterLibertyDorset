Your words were humble and yet your steps were nimble. Your smile was warm and you moved with considerate purpose. Perhaps this is a reflection of you. I hope to dance with you again.” - [[Ryuko Saito]]%0a* “I’m just getting to know this man and from what I know I like. He cares about my sister and makes a killer pasta bake so it’s all good. Hurt my sister though…well lets just say he’ll be the next victim in a live action version of my horror novel” - [[MercyGloriousScreamBlackmoore|Mercy]]%0a* “I worry about this kid, but this is also exactly what he asked for. He’s seen destiny in it’s rawest form, fate made form, and now he’s a part of the story. Welcome to the family, kid. It only gets better from here on out.” - [[ZaneGirruFoster|Zane]]%0a* “%25white%25[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdjR2lvIfJ4|Unexpected surprises]], with each smile and each suggestion, I find another unexpected surprise with this one. He makes me laugh and he gives me a whole new perspective on the world around us. No matter where you go or what you do along your path, know that I will walk it with you.” - [[KyriArhisImShirazi|Ky]]%0a*%25white%25 No simple task trying to sum this one up. So I'll try my hardest. He's brave foolish, loyal, and true Were these the Dark Ages I would trust his sword. Here and now I shall trust to the blade of his words that he is someone who would watch your back. He's a first rate Mage and a First rate human being. -[[AriaAetherRockefeller|Aether]]%0a
