While it is sometimes opened to the public, the Fairchild family normally only allows family to use it, painting the family gatherings as teacher conferences or the like. One section kept away from the public is the library that Dr. Fairchild began and others in the family have continued since documenting the trips he and his pack underwent and what they discovered there that was not meant for those not of the People to know.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25''Halissee Hall''%0a%3c %0a%3c District: South\\%0a%3c Neighborhood: Coral Gables\\%0a%3c Owned By: University of Miami%0a%3c %0a%3c Spheres and Factions%0a%3c * Werewolf%0a%3c * Wolf-blooded%0a%3c * Sewell Family%0a%3c %0a%3c Hooks%0a%3c *%0a%3c %0a%3c :Description:  The Sewell family’s house was one of Miami’s most prominent homes in the early 20th century. Halissee Hall was acquired by the University of Miami in 1932 and over the years the University of Miami School of Medicine and Jackson Memorial Hospital grew up around the former estate. In 1997, the Medical Faculty Association took the initiative to undertake a complete restoration of this National Historic Register structure. When completed, Halissee will be home to the School of Medicine’s Faculty Club and will host receptions, conferences and lectures – once again, entertaining men and women vital to the growth of Miami and South Florida.%0a%3c %0a%3c It is known among the family that there is a series of tunnels under the University of Miami that allow the family access to their home on campus. Some say that both brothers had a hand in building it as a way to move around in emergencies. Only the Sewell family knows all the ways in and out of the tunnel system safely, however, although there have been incidents of curious students venturing into portions of the network.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> :Description:%0a> %0a

There is a calmness felt by those who can enter the Shadow. It is home to mostly harmless spirits; Vice spirits go a little crazy in the Shadowed reflection of bars and shady alleyways, but murder spirits are rare and death spirits seem to be non-existent. To the untrained eye, it isn’t bad at all. Hell, it’s better than the physical world at times. Lower ranking spirits have established a pool hall.%0a> %0a> The edges of Portland’s shadow are showing signs of change, however, they have slipped beneath the notice of most. Certain groups, however, watch these changes closely - some Wolf packs, members of the Circle of the Crone and the head of the Mysterium have noticed the small spirit scouts along the borders attempting to go unnoticed. In their wake, when left unchecked, higher ranking spirits have also attempted to sneak in without confrontation. With this knowledge, some have begun to investigate what is happening beyond Portland’s boundaries.%0a

There is a calmness felt by those who can enter the Shadow. It is home to mostly harmless spirits; Vice spirits go a little crazy in the Shadowed reflection of bars and shady alleyways, but murder spirits are rare and death spirits seem to be non-existent. To the untrained eye, it isn’t bad at all. Hell, it’s better than the physical world at times. Lower ranking spirits have established a pool hall.%0a%3c %0a%3c The edges of Portland’s shadow are showing signs of change, however, they have slipped beneath the notice of most. Certain groups, however, watch these changes closely - some Wolf packs, members of the Circle of the Crone and the head of the Mysterium have noticed the small spirit scouts along the borders attempting to go unnoticed. In their wake, when left unchecked, higher ranking spirits have also attempted to sneak in without confrontation. With this knowledge, some have begun to investigate what is happening beyond Portland’s boundaries.%0a%3c %0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Directory: Werewolf the Forsaken%0a%3c About the Venue	History	Society	Locations	Player Guide%0a%3c %0a%3c Portland, OR %0a%3c Districts%0a%3c %0a%3c Changeling %0a%3c Player Guide%0a%3c %0a%3c Mage %0a%3c Player Guide%0a%3c %0a%3c Mortal %0a%3c Player Guide%0a%3c %0a%3c Vampire %0a%3c Player Guide%0a%3c %0a%3c Werewolf %0a%3c Player Guide%0a%3c Edit - History - Print - Recent Changes - Search%0a%3c Page last modified on July 20, 2017, at 12:18 AM%0a%3c The Storytelling System, Beast the Primordial, Changeling the Lost, Chronicles of Darkness, Demon the Descent, Mage the Awakening, Vampire the Requiem, and Werewolf the Forsaken ©2014-2016 CCP hf and published by Onyx Path Publishing.%0a%3c Produced by Jeff Vandenberg.
