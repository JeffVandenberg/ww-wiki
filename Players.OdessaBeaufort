Odessa is a woman with a lovely french accent, she dresses in fashionable but practical clothing. Odessa tends to keep her hair short and spends a good amount of time making it just so. She clearly takes great stock in her appearance and spends time to ensure she is more than presentable when she leaves her house. She is fun loving and relaxed most of the time, she is fiercely protective over the people she cares about and will go the ends of the earth for those she loves. She also really likes alcohol.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Mien''%0a%0a%25center%25To those that see past the mask, she trades her refined looks in for a more rough and tumble look. Her legs are digigrade and covered in fur, her feet are gone replaced by a pair of hooves. She has horns sprouting from her head and for all intents and purposes she looks like a Satyr of old, minus the mustache and smell of course. She takes care of herself. Her fur is a soft reddish brown color with small white spots towards her thighs. Her short hair matches her fur color and is a little more unkept than in her mask. %0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Mantle''%0a%0a%25center%25Her mantle represents the wild nature and growth of spring. When she is around you can smell that wonderful earthy fragrance of earth after rain. Then at times you catch the smell of fresh peaches or even the gentle hint of Peach Brandy. As she walks along plants don't bloom from her hooves or fall from her her hair, instead of things seem to simply get brighter and greener.  %0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a(:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 bgcolor=#0d0d0d:)%0a(:cellnr width=100%25 bgcolor=#0d0d0d:)%0a|| %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/8XvajD0.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/8XvajD0.jpg]] || %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/jP6v1ol.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/jP6v1ol.jpg]] || %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/k5YPzBB.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/k5YPzBB.jpg]] || %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/5eVeFwh.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/5eVeFwh.jpg]]  || %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/tIDnN4o.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/tIDnN4o.jpg]] || %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/8p86JRU.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/8p86JRU.jpg]]%0a|| %25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/MWsUDBg.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/MWsUDBg.jpg]] %0a(:tableend:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''Contacts'''%0a%0a||! %25changeling%25Image ||! %25changeling%25Name ||! %25changeling%25Relationship ||! %25changeling%25Comment ||! %25changeling%25Ringtone ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/6n6JQ5y.jpg || %25changeling%25[[Players.SaskiaNovaLinnik |%25changeling%25 Sas]]|| %25changeling%25Something new to Explore || %25changeling%25An interesting young woman, every day I enjoy learning a little more about her. || %25newwin%25[[https://youtu.be/JZweDwbJ_Ic|%25changeling%25Howl]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''Hooks'''%0a%0a!!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''[[City.TwoGoatsandaNymph|Two Goats and a Nymph]] (Everyone)'': %0aThis pub is situated in Morningside.
