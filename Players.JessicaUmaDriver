Straight, raven black hair cascades down her head and her smooth, pale skin seems to defy her life of adventure. She carries herself with the poise and confidence of a woman who has seen troubles in her life and come out the other side stronger, if not unscathed. The shaman is a woman of obvious hungers and desires, her passion seeming to radiate off of her and potentially catching the eye of those who respond in kind. Uma is as likely to be found in a gown with elegant flats, an evening dress with stiletto heels for a night clubbing, or rugged clothing designed to protect her from the elements on one of her many adventures. She is far from unshakeable, but she does her best to present an image of strength and perseverance at all times.%0a%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25mage%25'''Nimbus'''%0a%0a!!!!!%25center%25%25mage%25''Long term'': %0a%0a%25center%25Spirits that seek to protect or claim knowledge are drawn to Uma. In her they see either a kindred spirit or a target who will lead them to their desired sources of essence.%0a%0a!!!!!%25center%25%25mage%25''Immediate'': %0a%0a%25center%25Uma takes on an ephemeral aspect bathed in purple light. In that moment her mortal visage seems to fade away and the ephemera that remains behind reveals the shaman as a being of awe and terror, an idealized image of Jessica that seems unassailable. (Nimbus Tilt: -2 Composure Rolls from her unsettling visage)%0a%0a!!!!!%25center%25%25mage%25''Signature'': %0a%0a%25center%25In the background a soft murmuring can be heard. As it is scrutinized it reveals itself to be the soft murmuring of spirits recounting the deeds of Uma in their own strange tongue.%0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25mage%25'''Contacts'''%0a%0a||! %25mage%25Image ||! %25mage%25Name ||! %25mage%25Relationship ||! %25mage%25Comment ||! %25mage%25Ringtone ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/4jGcQje.jpg || %25mage%25Ellen Smith  || %25mage%25Sleepwalker Acolyte || %25mage%25NPC || %25newwin%25[[https://youtu.be/rXn8srKfF90|%25mage%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/n1TUM31.png || %25mage%25This could be you!  || %25mage%25Relationship to PC || %25mage%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mage%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/n1TUM31.png || %25mage%25This could be you!  || %25mage%25Relationship to PC || %25mage%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mage%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/n1TUM31.png || %25mage%25This could be you!  || %25mage%25Relationship to PC || %25mage%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mage%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/n1TUM31.png || %25mage%25This could be you!  || %25mage%25Relationship to PC || %25mage%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mage%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25mage%25'''Hooks'''%0a%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=25px margin-right=25px width=200px height=200px%25https://i.imgur.com/8NlOTYN.jpg %0a!!!!%25mage%25 ''Treasure Hunting (Adventurous sorts)'': %0aJessica is an avid outdoorswoman and hunter.
