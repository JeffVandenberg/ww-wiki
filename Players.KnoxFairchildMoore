His father, who cared for a patch of land, and supplied the small town with tobacco and chopped wood, lost three toes and a hand to frost bite after a freak accident when chopping a tree down left him pinned under it. That same winter, his two youngest sisters died of pneumonia, and his mother was lost to the bottle, in her grief. Knox, ever the dutiful son, did what he could to alleviate the issues that his family started to have.%0a%0a''West Virginia…''%0a%0aThat... was also when the stress started to become too much. The pressure started to build, until he started to realize that he had… abilities. A man came to them with a case of jaundice bad enough that they were worried he wouldn’t make it the week, and after trying everything and anything from his mother’s journals, he laid hands upon the man, and took the sickness onto himself. He made the man promise to not speak of it, as he wanted not to be branded a witch, or a devil-worshiper in the small town.%0a%0a%25werewolf%25'''The Present:'''%0a%0a'''The Healer of Havana'''%0a%0a%25rfloat%25https://46.media.tumblr.com/f1d3e63c453ea006916883fef283a914/tumblr_n2pdw0YiaU1tvu967o2_250.gif%0aAnd so, eventually it came to pass that sickness found its roots in Miami, and the most vulnerable, the poorest were hit hard with it.  Through discussions, through deals, medicines were found, but the implementation of such things was a cumbersome and clunky issue that didn’t help those that needed it the most.%0a%0aSo Knox took a stand.  He went among the sick, the tired, the dying, and he used the gifts he had at his disposal, healing more than most would think possible, each touch, each prayer drawing the sickness into himself, slowly but surely pulling him closer and closer to death.  Soon, the entire building was cleansed, but Knox wound up in a Prince Foundation facility…%0a%0a'''Coal Country Blues'''%0a%0a%25lfloat%25https://66.media.tumblr.com/38697a701cd4955c31f75d8ef150069a/tumblr_nlm2jzDdb41rtocego4_250.gif%0a%0aAs issues grew in Miami, changes began to overtake Knox.  Folks started to notice that he was snapping more easily, that he was more irritable...  that he was hearing voices.  Some suggested it was just stress, but one pointed out that there was a good chance that he was on the verge of his First Change.%0a%0aWanting to make sure that he didn't harm his wife, or those that he cared for, he went home for a week, back to his father's hunting camp in West Virginia, to commune with the wilds once again.  What he found there though, would leave him forever changed.%0a%0aIt seems the coal company that had bought the mineral rights to the land was up to no good.  They were wheeling and dealing with the Pure, and were trying to raise... something.  People were dead, and Knox was targeted for simply being there.  It didn't work out well for them though.  The first change took him, and he ended the ritual in the most violent way he could...%0a%0a'''Blood on the Dance Floor'''%0a%0a%25rfloat width=500px%25https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/covers/images/015/244/644/small/natalie-orekhovna-ice-side-0060-0-00-00-00-0-00-00-00.jpg%0a%0aEventually, there came a time when Knox felt the urge to look into an issue.  It seemed that there were spirits involved in a murder at a night club.  Wanting to lend a hand, as that was his nature, and dealing with spirits, which apparently also was his nature now, he joined the group going to investigate.  Subterfuge was never his strongest point, but there were others there who were able to get them in.  Once inside, it was easy for Knox to discern what had happened, tapping into spiritual nature of the location, he saw exactly how it started, and who started it.%0a%0aBefore he could try to discern how to deal with these folks, it came to be that they were attacked by the very man who was selling the drug that started the issue of this specific murder.  Joined by something that he truly hoped was a Ridden, and not something else.  Not one for fighting, Knox had to think creatively.  Calling upon influences from the spirit realm, he fashioned a mutable spire of ice to strike down the beast that nearly killed him in one blow.%0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a!!%25center%25%25werewolf%25'''Contacts'''%0a%0a||! %25werewolf%25Image ||! %25werewolf%25Name ||! %25werewolf%25Relationship ||! %25werewolf%25Comment ||! %25werewolf%25Ringtone ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://justrichest.com/wp-content/uploads/Catharine-Daddario-640x474.jpg || %25Werewolf%25[[VieveFairchild| Vivi]]|| %25werewolf%25My Hopes and Dreams || %25werewolf%25Sometimes, you don't need words || %25newwin%25[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ9L4PewTuY|%25mortal%25Make It Sweet]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25werewolf%25'''Hooks'''%0a%0a!!!!%25werewolf%25 ''Married into the blood(Werewolf)'':%0aKnox has been more recently known to have married into the Fairchild family, and is more than happy to talk about the love of his life.%0a%0a!!!!%25mortal%25 ''Southern Gentleman(Everyone)'': %0aMore specifically, he's just downright polite.

His father, who cared for a patch of land, and supplied the small town with tobacco and chopped wood, lost three toes and a hand to frost bite after a freak accident when chopping a tree down left him pinned under it. That same winter, his two youngest sisters died of pneumonia, and his mother was lost to the bottle, in her grief. Knox, ever the dutiful son, did what he could to alleviate the issues that his family started to have.%0a%3c %0a%3c ''West Virginia…''%0a%3c %0a%3c That... was also when the stress started to become too much. The pressure started to build, until he started to realize that he had… abilities. A man came to them with a case of jaundice bad enough that they were worried he wouldn’t make it the week, and after trying everything and anything from his mother’s journals, he laid hands upon the man, and took the sickness onto himself. He made the man promise to not speak of it, as he wanted not to be branded a witch, or a devil-worshiper in the small town.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25werewolf%25'''The Present:'''%0a%3c %0a%3c '''The Healer of Havana'''%0a%3c %0a%3c And so, eventually it came to pass that sickness found its roots in Miami, and the most vulnerable, the poorest were hit hard with it.  Through discussions, through deals, medicines were found, but the implementation of such things was a cumbersome and clunky issue that didn’t help those that needed it the most.%0a%3c %0a%3c So Knox took a stand.  He went among the sick, the tired, the dying, and he used the gifts he had at his disposal, healing more than most would think possible, each touch, each prayer drawing the sickness into himself, slowly but surely pulling him closer and closer to death.  Soon, the entire building was cleansed, but Knox wound up in a Prince Foundation facility…%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c (:div2end:)%0a
