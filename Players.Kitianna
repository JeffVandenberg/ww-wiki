Her complexion is the shade of milky tea, her skin smooth. Steely blue eyes have a hint of darker shades and flecks of silver to them, a natural almond shape to them with a bit of a lift at the outer corner. She has black hair that reaches to her mid thigh in length, tumbling in soft waves over her shoulders and back. The sides are drawn back and secured with a black strip of leather. Dangling from her earlobes are two pairs of earrings, the first of which is a small silver hoop, and the second of which is an engraved bone hoop. The skin of her neck is mostly hidden by a length of thin crimson fabric that's looped loosely and knotted to the right side. Depending on the angle, there may be glimpses of a metal collar around her neck, inset with an almost black ruby. She has a crimson cotton blouse that buttons up the front, the top few buttons undone and showing a bit of skin. The shirt is styled to fit close but be comfortable. The sleeves are long, neatly folded to her elbow and secured with a button. Below her shirt, Kitianna wears a pair of brown leather pants that fit her a bit loose, for comfort's sake. The pants are supple and soft, showing a bit of wear. On her feet is worn a pair of brown leather boots that have a thick but soft sole to them, her pantlegs pulled down overtop of them. Either worn or carried by the slender and athletically-built woman is a dark brown leather duster.] %0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Mien''%0a%0a%25center%25[Kitianna looks very similar as in her mask. There are differences to be seen, though. One is in her ears, for they draw up into a slender point instead of being rounded. Her eyes are also different, the pupils vertical and the colour of them ranging through shades of blue and green. Her four canine teeth have a slight elongation to them and draw to more definite points.] %0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Mantle''%0a%0a%25center%25[An occasional whiff of sulphur like the striking of a match and the scent of charred wood.
