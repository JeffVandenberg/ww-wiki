She tends to wear more relaxed clothes, Jeans,cutoffs, sneakers, tee shirts ,and tank tops. Her brown eyes vibrant and expressive.While she wears her brown hair long usually loosely,a highly athletic individual she is well toned and just seems to genuinely enjoy life. As a DJ her clothing style gets more exotic and flamboyant or subdued black but always fancy once shes putting on the actual show while shes setting up shes found in her usual attire. She seems to have a goofy personality and will often go out of her way to chat with people that she meets just to see how their day is going.Those that stick around and get to know her better will quickly learn that she is multilingual speaking Spanish and Russian as fluently as English. She will often wear clothes that show off a lily half sleeve tattoo on her left arm and an angel on her right extremely pleased with them above her others. That all said she is also a party hound off the clock and will drink with her friends well into the next morning if she's allowed. She wont drive during those times thankfully Those listening closely will pick up her L.A. accent which despite the number of years shes been in Miami she just can't seem to lose.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[%3c%3c]] %0a%3c !!! %25mortal%25 History:%0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #6e68a3' margin-top=8px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=20px margin-right=10px width=300%25https://i.imgur.com/X6UgGkw.jpg%0a%3c For the most part Maria is fairly open with her history she was born and raised in L.A. an interracial baby with a much older father and a really talented mother who encouraged her to get into music making sure that she learned to play many instruments as well as sing.
