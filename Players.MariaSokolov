She seems to have a goofy personality and will often go out of her way to chat with people that she meets just to see how their day is going.Those that stick around and get to know her better will quickly learn that she is multilingual speaking Spanish and Russian as fluently as English. She will often wear clothes that show off a lily half sleeve tattoo on her left arm and an angel on her right extremely pleased with them above her others. That all said she is also a party hound off the clock and will drink with her friends well into the next morning if she's allowed.
