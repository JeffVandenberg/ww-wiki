As the Hippie Movement was spreading all across the country, psychics and pagan practitioners (both with and without legitimate powers) came together in Portland out of a desire for that similar sense of tribal community. Thought it was formed not long after the Rose City Guild, the Sisters existed outside the Guild. Many of them were not even aware of the Guild’s existence, not at first. %0a%0aThe Sisters developed their Doctrine over the course of the decade as the membership grew into their powers and the national dialogue around women shifted after the publication of Friedan’s The Feminine Mystique. They became devoted to the success of their members, whatever form that success meant, and to the elimination of those who stood in the way of that success. In the public eye, the Sisters were outspoken activists at feminist protests and rallies, while in private they worked to hex the status quo. In the mid 1970s, however, the cult’s attention was diverted from the glass ceiling as the War of the Four spilled into the mortal lives of Portland. %0a%0aSix years ago, the cult ostensibly vanished when High Priestess Siobhan Walsh was found dead in her Crestwood home, which also served as the headquarters of the Fundament. The remaining sisters scattered to the winds, seeming to vanish off the grid overnight. Siobhan’s daughter, Juniper, has returned to Portland and begun to discover her mother’s secrets, including the Book of Shadows, the cult’s secret ritual space beneath the house, and the truth about what she thought was simply her mother’s coven. Though the cult has laid broken these past years, Juniper will come to believe that it is time for a renaissance of the Fundament-- especially as Portland’s nights grow more fraught with danger.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''%25color=#008080%25Purpose''' \\%0a%0aBy exploring the intersection of feminine power and spirituality, the Sisters of the Fundament provide a foundation of support while pushing the boundaries of the Self, achieving their Goals, and banishing Obstacles that stand in their way. %0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''%25color=#008080%25Doctrine''' \\%0a%0aThe Sisters are, first and foremost, devoted to each other’s success. Each Sister declares different Goals that they aspire to achieve and the Cult works with them to help make those Goals manifest. The Goals that each Sister declares can cover a wide variety of spheres, mundane or supernatural, physical or emotional. There are no wrong answers. One Sister’s Goal may be to bring more wealth into her life, another’s may be to expand her psychic abilities, while another may be to try and heal a psychological trauma that haunts her from the past. The Cult teaches that each Sister brings with her unique strengths and weaknesses, which should be celebrated. All of these, then, weave together to form the Fundament. As they believe that united they are stronger, the Sisterhood channels the Collective Power of the Fundament to help each Sister achieve her aspirations. When an Obstacle stands in the way of a Sister’s goal, or worse, a Sister is in danger, she can always count on the Fundament banding together to banish this threat to her success. %0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''%25color=#008080%25Relic''' \\%0a%0aThere is a Book of Shadows that has passed from one High Priestess to the next, containing in it the rites of the Fundament going back to its founding.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''%25color=#008080%25Titles and Mechanics''' \\%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25'''Page of Cups''' %0a%25center%25 MCI Status • \\%0a%25center%25''The Page of Cups, like the Pages in all the suits, represents some sort of beginning or renewal.

Behind her is a spring sky, different from the winter settings on most other Swords cards, and this has an emergence and growth quality to it. The sky is clear, representing her clarity of mind as she considers matters of the intellect.

She sits at the gate before the great Mystery, as indicated by the Tree of Life in the background. She sits between the darkness and the light, represented by the pillars of Solomon’s temple, which suggests it is she who is the mediator of the passage into the depth of reality. The tapestry hung between the pillars keeps the casual onlookers out and allows only those initiated to enter. The pomegranates on the tapestry are sacred to Persephone. They are a symbol of duty (because Persephone ate a pomegranate seed in the underworld which forced her to return every year). The blue robe the Priestess is wearing is a symbol of knowledge. She is wearing the crown of Isis symbolising the Triple Goddess. The solar cross on her breast is a symbol of balance between male and female.''%0a%0a||! Status Level ||! Title ||! Description ||!

As a member of the Cult takes an Action, you can act as a point of leadership and call upon other members to support her. Sisters that are present in the scene may reflexively spend Willpower to add +3 to the roll. Characters that spend Willpower and also possess this level of MCI add +4 instead of +3. Note that this does not increase the amount of Willpower a character can spend per turn, but does allow multiple characters to spend Willpower on a roll. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25color=#008080%25'''Deeds'''%0a%3c %0a%3c *Example%0a%3c *Example%0a%3c *Example%0a%3c *Example%0a%3c *Example%0a%3c *Example%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25'''%25color=#008080%25Contact''' \\%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25 PC or NPC who leads the MCI%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:cellnr width=100%25:)%0a%3c !%25center%25%25color=#008080%25'''Quotes'''%0a%3c %0a%3c %25mortal%25 ''"I am a quote!
