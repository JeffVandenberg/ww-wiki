In the 1950's her family had long since faded but her motley, new family, had taken up residence.  After the death of her motley she left the farm to rot as she focused on her mission.  Long years of neglect caused the barn to collapse, the tin roofing to mangle, and the farm house to turn into a dilapidated ruin.  Lavender grew wild throughout the property while nature took over.

There are four bedrooms for any new Summer courtiers who need a place to stay.  Summer courtiers can often be found relaxing on the porch or cooking food in the expansive kitchen.  As with the other Freehold locations there is usually something to eat or drink ready for any Lost who need it.  It's always appreciated when courtiers bring groceries over.%0a%0aThe barn is split into two sections.  The first section is for lavender drying and processing as well as ice cream production.

Courtiers who wish to hone their wilderness survival skills would be right at home here in the woods or open fields.  The lake is a great place to swim or fish with bright, clean water filled with fish and water plants.  The river is shallow with smooth worn pebbles and rocks lining the bottom.  Salmon can be seen swimming it during seasonal times along with the occasional bear looking for an easy meal.  There are rocky areas for climbing or hiking with outcroppings and wild earthly fare growing here or there.  The whole of the farm seems to epitomize the nostalgic or beloved parts of summer.

With experience in the food industry back in Palm Springs, California; Maria relocated to Portland. As a former employee of the Mexican Consulate in Portland her diverse background and passion is currently funneled into growing her business. She enjoys cultural events and small business development, which drives the creativity behind Revolución. The style of product including the traditional Mexican warm beverages and desserts made by her sister, Zulema, and cookies made by her mom, Silvia, are influenced by her passion for art, culture, cooking and folklore. She believes there is a niche in the well known Portland coffee scene for these products, coffee drinking and café culture in México and Central America. %0a> %0a> ''Our products at Revolución, such as coffee, atole, champurrado & café de olla are not only delicious, they reflect a page in my own personal cultural heritage and they play a role in the larger story of What is Mexico? I am excited to share something a little different with the Portland coffee drinking scene.''%0a> %0a62,63c56,60%0a%3c The property has wide open empty fields, wooded areas, lavender fields, a winding shallow river, a lake on one edge, and rockie areas.

The Huntress may also hold a barbecue each season or perhaps offer up a bonfire to courtiers and their ensorcelled.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Maria started a project at Oregon State Penitentiary with the Latino Club. There she created custom made cut paper (papel picado). This project brought Latino inmates together in a cultural experience while at the same time teaching them a popular art in Mexico. This art will help them invest little money and time to produce beautiful decorations that can be sold instantly and get money fast without defaulting again for lack of opportunities once they are out here or in Mexico. %0a> %0a> While the café offers an assortment of Mexican staples, Revolución is best known for a trio of traditional drinks. Cups of warm, corn masa-based atole are sweetened with shaved piloncillo (unrefined cane sugar). Aromatic cinnamon-laced café de la olla is served by the pot. And thick, rich mugs of champurrado combine hot chocolate mixed with corn flour.  In the small coffeehouse kitchen, Garcia helps prepare crisp empanadas and desserts inspired by her mother and sisters recipes. During Revolucións early years, Garcia made everything herself. After four years in business, however, she has hired help to make more time in her life for herself and for civic engagement. %0a> %0a> %0a89d85%0a%3c **Persimmon (Fall only)%0a

With experience in the food industry back in Palm Springs, California; Maria relocated to Portland. As a former employee of the Mexican Consulate in Portland her diverse background and passion is currently funneled into growing her business. She enjoys cultural events and small business development, which drives the creativity behind Revolución. The style of product including the traditional Mexican warm beverages and desserts made by her sister, Zulema, and cookies made by her mom, Silvia, are influenced by her passion for art, culture, cooking and folklore. She believes there is a niche in the well known Portland coffee scene for these products, coffee drinking and café culture in México and Central America. %0a%3c %0a%3c ''Our products at Revolución, such as coffee, atole, champurrado & café de olla are not only delicious, they reflect a page in my own personal cultural heritage and they play a role in the larger story of What is Mexico? I am excited to share something a little different with the Portland coffee drinking scene.''%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=25px margin-right=25px width=250px height=250px%25https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/L2xhK4oILd7ehf7kotstog/o.jpg%0a%3c  %0a%3c Maria started a project at Oregon State Penitentiary with the Latino Club. There she created custom made cut paper (papel picado). This project brought Latino inmates together in a cultural experience while at the same time teaching them a popular art in Mexico. This art will help them invest little money and time to produce beautiful decorations that can be sold instantly and get money fast without defaulting again for lack of opportunities once they are out here or in Mexico. %0a%3c %0a%3c While the café offers an assortment of Mexican staples, Revolución is best known for a trio of traditional drinks. Cups of warm, corn masa-based atole are sweetened with shaved piloncillo (unrefined cane sugar). Aromatic cinnamon-laced café de la olla is served by the pot. And thick, rich mugs of champurrado combine hot chocolate mixed with corn flour.  In the small coffeehouse kitchen, Garcia helps prepare crisp empanadas and desserts inspired by her mother and sisters recipes. During Revolucións early years, Garcia made everything herself. After four years in business, however, she has hired help to make more time in her life for herself and for civic engagement. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c  [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c '''SPECIALTY PRODUCT:'''%0a%3c %0a%3c ''Cafe de olla, a traditional Mexican coffee beverage often prepared in handmade clay pots.
