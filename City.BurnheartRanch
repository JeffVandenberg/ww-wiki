With experience in the food industry back in Palm Springs, California; Maria relocated to Portland. As a former employee of the Mexican Consulate in Portland her diverse background and passion is currently funneled into growing her business. She enjoys cultural events and small business development, which drives the creativity behind Revolución. The style of product including the traditional Mexican warm beverages and desserts made by her sister, Zulema, and cookies made by her mom, Silvia, are influenced by her passion for art, culture, cooking and folklore. She believes there is a niche in the well known Portland coffee scene for these products, coffee drinking and café culture in México and Central America. %0a%0a''“Our products at Revolución, such as coffee, atole, champurrado & café de olla are not only delicious, they reflect a page in my own personal cultural heritage and they play a role in the larger story of “What is Mexico?” I am excited to share something a little different with the Portland coffee drinking scene.”''%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=25px margin-right=25px width=350px height=500px%25https://i1.wp.com/www.adventureaffinity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Terre-Bleu-Lavender-Farm.jpg%0a %0aMaria started a project at Oregon State Penitentiary with the Latino Club. There she created custom made cut paper (papel picado). This project brought Latino inmates together in a cultural experience while at the same time teaching them a popular art in Mexico. This art will help them invest little money and time to produce beautiful decorations that can be sold instantly and get money fast without defaulting again for lack of opportunities once they are out here or in Mexico. %0a%0aWhile the café offers an assortment of Mexican staples, Revolución is best known for a trio of traditional drinks. Cups of warm, corn masa-based atole are sweetened with shaved piloncillo (unrefined cane sugar). Aromatic cinnamon-laced café de la olla is served by the pot. And thick, rich mugs of champurrado combine hot chocolate mixed with corn flour.  In the small coffeehouse kitchen, Garcia helps prepare crisp empanadas and desserts inspired by her mother and sister’s recipes. During Revolución’s early years, Garcia made everything herself.
