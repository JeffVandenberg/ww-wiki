Her naturally dark hair is often seen styled according to her latest whim; sometimes straight, sometimes curled; chestnut brown replaced by copper red or platinum blonde tones; braided, ponytailed, or simply let loose in a mane of long, soft locks. Neatly trimmed eyebrows and long, dark lashes add a certain intensity to her eyes, bright and warm that shimmers with every shade of blue.
