When she speaks some may catch the fact her tongue is split and dimples even when she isn't smiling.%0a%0aStanding at just a hair under five and a half feet in height, her frame is more willowy and athletically toned. Her facial features are easily considered pretty, with expressive bright silver eyes, smooth sun kissed skin. The young woman's naturally dark brown hair worked into dreadlocks that are a colorful array of purplish red to blue that when left undone and freed hang to near mid back.%0a%0aOften her clothing consists of bohemian styles with her backpack slung over one of her shoulders. The scents of marijuana and white sage often echoing from her form. Sometimes the bite mark on her right arm is invisible, but most of the time she tries to keep it covered with an array of things.%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a!!%25center%25%25color=#B28C5D%25'''Hooks'''%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=20px margin-right=15px width=210 margin-bottom=10px margin-left=10px newwin%25 https://i.imgur.com/qqUEfCk.jpg%0a!!!!%25color=#B28C5D%25 ''Empyrean Farms(All)":%0aShe is there personal veterinarian and practices on all animals but mentions having a specialty with canines.%0a%0a!!!!%25color=#B28C5D%25 ''Wolf-Blood(Werewolves/Wolf-Bloods)"%0aNow has the basic understanding that she is one and that this stupid bite mark is never going away!

When she speaks some may catch the fact her tongue is split and dimples even when she isn't smiling.%0a%3c %0a%3c Standing at just a hair under five and a half feet in height, her frame is more willowy and athletically toned. Her facial features are easily considered pretty, with expressive bright silver eyes, smooth sun kissed skin. The young woman's naturally dark brown hair worked into dreadlocks that are a colorful array of purplish red to blue that when left undone and freed hang to near mid back.%0a%3c %0a%3c Often her clothing consists of bohemian styles with her backpack slung over one of her shoulders. The scents of marijuana and white sage often echoing from her form. Sometimes the bite mark on her right arm is invisible, but most of the time she tries to keep it covered with an array of things.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c (:div2end:)%0a%3c !!%25center%25%25color=#B28C5D%25'''Hooks'''%0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=20px margin-right=15px width=210 margin-bottom=10px margin-left=10px newwin%25 https://i.imgur.com/qqUEfCk.jpg%0a%3c !!!!%25color=#B28C5D%25 ''Veterinarian(All)":%0a%3c She practices on all animals but mentions having a specialty with canines%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25color=#B28C5D%25 ''Wolf-Blood(Werewolves/Wolf-Bloods)"%0a%3c Thanks to some random asshat she is now part of a whole new world she is still getting used to.
