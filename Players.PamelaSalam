When I was born with her looks she gave me her dreams with them. Pageants, modeling jobs, she was always showing off her little girl, but it was her dream not mine. Still, I'm not turning it down am I? I have natural features, know how to do my makeup, and dress myself. If you think appearances don't matter you're fooling yourself. "%0a%0aPamela is leggy with smooth, soft features and honey blonde hair that tumbles down her body. She has an inviting smile, plump lips, sometimes paired with rounding glasses. Pamela dresses well for whatever setting she finds herself. Trendy, but not overpriced casual clothes. Short skirts or dresses that flatter her figure when out partying. Appealing, but professional clothes just this side of sexy when working at her internship. When at strictly supernatural functions, it also largely depends on the nature of the event. Often a velvet choker with an onyx stone sits on her throat, and her hair sometimes tied with a black ribbon monogramed with the greek letters Alpha Chi Omega. %0a[[%3c%3c]] %0a!!! %25vampire%25 History:%0a"My father came from Lebanon looking for a stable life free from the instabilities of the region of the world, with a fair bit of money and big imagination of the American Dream. He was an ambitious man, always full of schemes to make his fortune. He was well on his way, he was well invested in valuable real-estate holdings, he even married a local beauty queen and had a gifted daughter. He would have made it i think, but did i mention he was heavily invested in real estate? 2008 wasn't forgiving for his holdings and daddy lost it all. We struggled after that, mother and daddys big dreams thrust on their little girl. That has always seemed to be the theme of my life."%0a%0aPamela was raised in a state of modest wealth until the recession of 2008 when her fathers dream came crashing down. He couldn't afford her expensive schools, he couldn't afford her expensive clothes, mother had to get a job, pamela moved from a nice expensive neighborhood to hoping they could hold on to a middle class life. Pamela never lost her gifts though, apparent from an early age she was extremely intelligent and an even more voracious learner. She was speaking so early, soon in two, then three languages. She took to science with a passion, and learned just as quickly from her mother good manners and charm. Her mother would have liked her to join cheerleading but Pamela preferred academics where she could truly excel and hated participating in athletics. She was popular in school, but struggled with a lack of real challenges for her mind. %0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=10px border='2px solid #6e68a3' width=305 margin-right=0px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=10px newwin%25 https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/strangerthings8338/images/f/fb/Flayer_concept_art.PNG%0aTrips to New York to visit her uncle Mohammad were looked forward to with a religious zeal, perhaps the only religion she grew up with in her life. A curator and researcher at the natural history museum, he always had prepared fascinating lessons on topics most people her age would find boring or at least challenging. Pamela found them a delight, and one of her uncles co-workers, a curator named Vanessa also found the young Pamela a fascinating addition to the summer. Little did Pamela know Vanessa was a vampire and Dragon, and had eyed her year after year, counting the times until she would be fit for embracing her mind into the greatest challenges she could imagine.%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]] %0aVanessa was a fixture of Pamela's summer holidays, someone she distantly knew and was always fascinated in. Older, beautiful, brilliant, Vanessa carried herself with both authority and sweetness. Vanessa was many things to Pamela. A role model perhaps, a life goal, even possibly a first crush and fantasy. Vanessa and her uncle always said they had plans for her future in New York, when she could finally leave Florida forever. The finest schools, an internship with an exciting cutting edge program, more than she would ever bargain for. Unfortunately that's when the stroke happened. Her father was in the hospital, the damage was extensive, and even if he recovered he would need help, potentially the rest of his life. Pamela was an adult by then, even if barely and was readying herself to fly back to Florida to be with her father. Her plans would have to change, there was no way she could live in New York. She would have to be home, or at least close. Vanessa was distraught, and acted quickly. She wouldn't lose the opportunity to have Pamela for her own. She brought her to her home, Pamela's heart was racing, but it wasn't for the reasons she had hoped. It was there Vanessa and Mohammad revealed their secret to young Pamela. They were not just museum curators and scholars, not just lovers although Pamela had known that for some time, but they were mystics and some form of sorcerers. Alchemists. They had always sought to induct Pamela when she was old enough but with the news of her father their hand was forced. They said they might know a secret that could save him, but she would need to accomplish the ritual herself as his daughter along with Mohammad as his brother. Only his own flesh and blood could create the elixer of life for him. Pamela was incredulous, but faced with the truth and desperate as she was she studied like she never had before, and encountered challenges like she never did too. She grew by leaps and bounds, she was a natural at the art with the knowledge of sciences she already possessed. The time came to do the ritual, but at some point it all went wrong. A variable perhaps none had anticipated or maybe the ritual was wrong after all, but the consequences would change Pamela forever. A ritual that should have transformed her energy into a font of endless life instead shattered her body's equilibrium beyond repair and Instead of an elixir that would cure illness and bestow immortality for her dying father they transformed her into a creature that had an unnatural longevity and syphoned life from people she touched and lost it like a siv. %0a%0aShe Returned to Florida in shame and fear, but eventually learned to control her curse and the gifts that came with it, along with her knowledge of alchemy and in time it unlocked doors she never knew were there. She attended school and used her looks, her gifts, and the loose atmosphere to draw people around her to gain the life force she needed easier and the schools own science and medical programs to perfect her arts. She even started a sorority house that acted as a front for her activities built over an abandoned hall with an unsavory reputation. Now it's a matter of time before she learns more, ever seeking the next mystery to finish what she started and come to terms with her strange affliction. %0a%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]] %0a!!! %25vampire %25 Role Playing Hooks:%0a''The Daughter of a mother who never had the life she felt she deserved.

John Hopkins, MiT, Ivy League, UCLA, the sky was the limit. For whatever reasons instead she remained in Florida at University of Miami. I suppose some people just can't leave home. Still, many eyes remain on her for her impressively growing academic credentials. Recruiters for other schools, private sector, even government interests are rumored to be interested in the young woman's progress%0a%0a%25mortal%25 '''''AlphaChiOmega!

It was long rumored a cult of Illuminati operated in secret out of it. Or was it satanic devil worshippers? Some say it was a sex club engaging in depraved orgies. Most of the rumors say there was once a murder that stained its reputation. Whatever the reason the building closed it is open again now and its ambitious president is recruiting engaging and fascinating students with promising futures.

Older, beautiful, brilliant, Vanessa carried herself with both authority and sweetness. Vanessa was many things to Pamela. A role model perhaps, a life goal, even possibly a first crush and fantasy. Vanessa and her uncle always said they had plans for her future in New York, when she could finally leave Florida forever. The finest schools, an internship with an exciting cutting edge program, more than she would ever bargain for. Unfortunately that's when the stroke happened. Her father was in the hospital, the damage was extensive, and even if he recovered he would need help, potentially the rest of his life. Pamela was an adult by then, even if barely and was readying herself to fly back to Florida to be with her father. Her plans would have to change, there was no way she could live in New York. She would have to be home, or at least close. Vanessa was distraught, and acted quickly. She wouldn't lose the opportunity to have Pamela for her own. She brought her to her home, Pamela's heart was racing, but it wasn't for the reasons she had hoped. It was there Vanessa and Mohammad revealed their secret to young Pamela. They were not just museum curators and scholars, not just lovers although Pamela had known that for some time, but they were mystics and some form of sorcerers. Alchemists. They had always sought to induct Pamela when she was old enough but with the news of her father their hand was forced. They said they might know a secret that could save him, but she would need to accomplish the ritual herself as his daughter along with Mohammad as his brother. Only his own flesh and blood could create the elixer of life for him. Pamela was incredulous, but faced with the truth and desperate as she was she studied like she never had before, and encountered challenges like she never did too. She grew by leaps and bounds, she was a natural at the art with the knowledge of sciences she already possessed. The time came to do the ritual, but at some point it all went wrong. A variable perhaps none had anticipated or maybe the ritual was wrong after all, but the consequences would change Pamela forever. A ritual that should have transformed her energy into a font of endless life instead shattered her body's equilibrium beyond repair and Instead of an elixir that would cure illness and bestow immortality for her dying father they transformed her into a creature that had an unnatural longevity and syphoned life from people she touched and lost it like a siv. %0a---%0a> Vanessa was a fixture of Pamela's summer holidays, someone she distantly knew and was always fascinated in.

She didn't think it was a big deal walking alone frlm school, and even though she was told not to talk to strangers she didn't think it was so bad if it was a kid like her right? She saw the kid there playing with her toys as alone as she was, she ran up to her, they played together for HOURS forgetting the time, she offered Izzy one of her toys, anyone she wanted. Izzy chose a unicorn, and when she took it the child offered her hand instead. When they walked away together she left at the playground a doll that looked just like her new best friend. Her name was Grace then, grace the unicorn. They ran and jumped and played all day. The Princess cared for her, she fed her and combed her, they were inseparable. The Princess blessed her with incredible powers too, to help in their games. Rare was any of The Princess' friends more blessed than Grace the Unicorn. Somehow though, it all went wrong. Somehow the Princess left her. Somehow she was forgotten. Izzy doesn't remember the day, perhaps it's best she doesn't.%0a48,52c48,52%0a%3c WiP%0a%3c %0a%3c WiP%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> The Lost of Miami found her on the street and they took her in, and welcomed her as one of their own even though some of them whispered she clearly wasn't. She was a Playmate after all, they have a certain reputation. They're usually rarer in the human side of the world, because they so rarely escape or have any reason to try. They're pampered. Izzy knew it must have been the same for her, and maybe there was some sort of mistake. Maybe she got Lost, out playing and ran too far! That must be it. One day she ran, out back into the Thorns to find her way home, but no matter how hard she ran she couldn't find it. She was usually so good at finding things. One of The Princess' favorite games was hide and seek, and Grace was pretty good at finding her hiding places. She was lost in the thorns, and all hope seemed lost. She was alone, and began to hear howling. Wolves closed in, but before they could attack the freehold came again and rescued her, together they fought the dire wolves and Izzy learned too just as her rescuers how strong a unicorn could actually be, and how thrilling and amazing the heat of the fight was. It was something unlike anything at home, there was never any fighting there at all. There was never any of the pleasures she found celebrating with one of her rescuers that night either in the Princess' palace. %0a> %0a> This world had its charms she had to admit, and its people had her gratitude. She learned their stories, and the injustices they suffered and that's when she decided she would stay with them. She would play and fight and love with them, and try her best to remember what it was like to be a human as apparently they all once were. She Swore their promises and put the past in Arcadia behind her. She was helped to find who she once was, and helped destroy the doll left in her place. She cried to break something that once belonged to HER but when she did, she remembered, REALLY remembered her name. She stays with friends in the freehold now, and has the time of her life doing it. She has to after all, every moment she pushes to be the best moment, because in those moments of awful quiet and stillness she can almost hear the voice of a Princess. %0a> %0a> %0a55,68c55,68%0a%3c ''WiP''%0a%3c %0a%3c %25vampire%25 ''''':''''' \\%0a%3c %25%25 WiP%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=0px width=330 border='2px solid #6e68a3' margin-right=10px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=0px newwin%25 put a picture here%0a%3c %0a%3c %25vampire%25 '''' (fighting) :'''''\\%0a%3c %25%25 WiP%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25vampire%25 '''''):'''''\\%0a%3c %25%25 WiP%0a%3c %0a---%0a> ''Got something to do?

One of The Princess' favorite games was hide and seek, and Grace was pretty good at finding her hiding places. She was lost in the thorns, and all hope seemed lost. She was alone, and began to hear howling. Wolves closed in, but before they could attack the freehold came again and rescued her, together they fought the dire wolves and Izzy learned too just as her rescuers how strong a unicorn could actually be, and how thrilling and amazing the heat of the fight was. It was something unlike anything at home, there was never any fighting there at all. There was never any of the pleasures she found celebrating with one of her rescuers that night either in the Princess' palace. %0a%3c %0a%3c This world had its charms she had to admit, and its people had her gratitude. She learned their stories, and the injustices they suffered and that's when she decided she would stay with them. She would play and fight and love with them, and try her best to remember what it was like to be a human as apparently they all once were. She Swore their promises and put the past in Arcadia behind her. She was helped to find who she once was, and helped destroy the doll left in her place. She cried to break something that once belonged to HER but when she did, she remembered, REALLY remembered her name. She stays with friends in the freehold now, and has the time of her life doing it. She has to after all, every moment she pushes to be the best moment, because in those moments of awful quiet and stillness she can almost hear the voice of a Princess. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[%3c%3c]] %0a%3c !!! %25vampire %25 Role Playing Hooks:%0a%3c ''Got something to do? Im always ready for a game, or if you have one of those important missions I can come too. You know I can help right? Im strong and fast and unicorns can even heal your wounds. That's totally a thing someone told me once. Don't leave me alone or leave me behind. Its no fun when you leave, so promise?''%0a%3c %0a%3c %25vampire%25 '''''Easily Distracted (anyone) :''''' \\%0a%3c %25%25 its a PROBLEM. Izzy just can't keep her mind on anything for more than five minutes unless it's fun. She can't sit still, she can't stop and think, and she can't stick to a routine to save her life. She's tried, but can't manage to go to school and get a proper education (something someone taken as an elementary school kid could sorely need), she can't hold a steady job, and she would forget her head if it wasn't attached to her. On the other hand her tendency to wander leads her to the wildest adventures, and into the most unlikely places. Like the time she broke into unlicensed MMA fighting. Or the time she figured out shes a natural behind the wheel and started street racing and won this awesome bike. Or the time she got lost in a fetish club and forgot what a safeword was. It's almost like she is running away from something, or wants to think of anything else but what's on her mind%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=0px width=330 border='2px solid #6e68a3' margin-right=10px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=0px newwin%25 https://i.imgur.com/qj0Evtd.jpg%0a%3c %0a%3c %25vampire%25 '''''stronger than i look! (fighting) :'''''\\%0a%3c %25%25 she might be a cute little horse with a horn but when the time has come Izzy can hit like... Well a horse with a sharp deadly horn. She was courted by the Summers for awhile for her strength and ferocity in the heat of a moment but she decided in the end that outside of the moments when she needed it anger just didn't taste great in her mouth. She's still game for a fight though, for missions or just for fun. Just don't blame her for getting knocked on your butt by a princess toy. She'll kiss it and make you feel better too%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25vampire%25 '''''The right to bear arms? (changeling):'''''\\%0a%3c %25%25 izzy is a shapechanger, her skin fluid between a few different Beasts and traits belonging to them. Just as frequently as she might be in her human form she's at home in other shapes too, and in so many places. Some might say she seems more natural in a beasts skin than a person's, and maybe they're on to something. %0a%3c %0a%3c %25vampire%25 '''''Looking to make a quick buck (anyone):'''''\\%0a%3c %25%25 izzy could use some money and can't hold a job and has no proper education and few traditionally employable skills. If someone DID have something that suited her more unique skill set and was willing to help her with her finances and keep paying some sort of rent and it was exciting enough to hold her interest for more than a few hours maybe just maybe she would be interested. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[%3c%3c]] %0a---%0a> (:div %25width=100%25 style='color:white;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-attachment:fixed;background-color:black;background-position:bottom center;background-image:url([=https://i.imgur.com/iHbXGJ3.png=]); background-size:500; padding:25px;' width=100%25:)%0a> %0a> (:table valign=top:)%0a> %0a> (:cellnr rowspan=30 width=500 align=center:)%0a> !! %25center%25%25vampire%25'''Dossier'''%0a> %25center%25https://i.imgur.com/u6hUmg4.jpg%0a> !!%25center%25%25vampire%25'''Playlist'''%0a> *[[https://youtu.be/dM0ZXiokoiQ|Power and Control]]%0a> *[[https://youtu.be/8AIotLCskqk|Twisted Imagination]]%0a> *[[https://youtu.be/BMY9-WgI7sU|Zydrate Anatomy]]%0a> (:cellnr width=260 align=left:)%25vampire%25'''Name:''' %0a> (:cell width=440:) Pamela Salam%0a> (:cellnr width=260 align=left:)%25vampire%25'''Alias(es):''' %0a> (:cell width=440:) President,.
