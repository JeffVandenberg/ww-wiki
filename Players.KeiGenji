His pale skin, the color of coffee with far too much creamer, is covered along both arms with traditional Japanese tattoos portraying a koi fish down his left arm to symbolize strength and bravery; his back is covered with a Hannya mask in sole gray scale, and along his right arm is a nobori-ryu (“ascending Dragon”) motif to symbolize his rise to fame among the street racer culture. Across each wrist are the kanji for the code of Bushido. His eyes, a deep brown, peer around with a slightly disinterested stare; though once something catches his attention – they seem to glitter with a mad curiousity. His hair, naturally a dark brownish black, tends to range in color due to temporary dyes which alternate throughout the month.%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Contacts'''%0a%0a||! %25mortal%25Image ||! %25mortal%25Name ||! %25mortal%25Relationship ||! %25mortal%25Comment ||! %25mortal%25Ringtone ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Hooks'''%0a%0a!!!!%25mortal%25 ''The Honorable Criminal (Anyone)'': %0aKei recently arrived from Tokyo, having been backed by Yakuza in Tokyo, who have sent him to Portland to expand the influence of the Japanese Organized Crime - and while many were displeased with his arrival; the Speed Demon, was forced into the rank and file...which includes running various items, and people from one place to another - yet it seems a good bit of what he does criminally is used to help the Asian community of Portland, from helping with the cost of living to the basic needs of those who are less fortunate.%0a%0a!!!!%25mortal%25 ''The Lost Prodigy (Anyone)'': %0aKei's arrival in Portland was partly due to the fact of the underground street racing scene, but also because his cousin - Miyavi Genji, vanished under mysterious circumstances with a large sum of money that was intended for the Yakuza Oyabun; though Miyavi has been missing nearly six months; Kei has yet to find even the slightest hint of what may have happened to his cousin.%0a%0a!!!!%25mortal%25 ''Go go, Speed Racer?
