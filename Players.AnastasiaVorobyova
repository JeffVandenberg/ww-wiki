hair delicately spun of aged mahogany, rich and deep and satin-soft; inquisitive eyes wrought from hazel orchards; and rosebud lips coated in a layer of glossy pink. It is all a mirage of the human variety, a woman recast from the broken shards of her past, every flaw and blemish meticulously expunged — in their absence a Fairest was fashioned.%0a%0aThe '''Mien''' then a truer reflection of the Gentry's designs, every feature, every gesture, every last inch of her transformed in the realm beyond the Thorns. A woman of elvenkind the, like the denizens of ''Álfheimr'' or the faerie mounds of the Seelie, with pointed ears and intense eyes that seem to pierce through flesh and bone to gaze at the very soul itself. There is a faint shimmer to her pale skin, a gentle moonlight glow filtering through her very being, subtle yet everpresent. %0a%0aVerdant scents trail in the wake of her lissome form, willowy limbs suffused in the refreshing tones of the Emerald Court's '''Mantle'''; dew-ladened grass at the break of dawn; sap rising through birches in spring; and forest meadows of wild anemones in bloom. %0a[[%3c%3c]][[%3c%3c]]%0a!!! %25changeling%25 History:%0aFor those that are taken, there is an edge of maddening desperation to Faerie's wonder; it holds an intensity that has every emotion magnified, unearthly pleasures elevated by beauty that can not be put into words. How then could the Winter Palace or the ''Barge Haulers on the Volga'' hold up to the fey delights of Arcadia? No, this world exemplifies trivial banality compared to the grandeur of the fairytale realm. Few would have sought their way back here, had it not been for the unspeakable pains and abuse suffered at the hands of a Keeper. And so that intensity of Faerie turned all to quickly into severity instead; the harmony of the symphony is marred by a single key pressed at the wrong moment and panic bubbled up within; the exuberance of composing a new piece faded into into fearful and frustrated tears when her Keeper deemed it unworthy; and the pride and joy of conjuring music out of nothing but her hands and her imagination drowned slowly in the shallows of the Durance.%0a%0aHow much is freedom worth? How steep a cost for a second chance at life? Some questions are better left unspoken, some thoughts better left alone. Miami is a sanctuary, a haven to heal and recover from the capricious and cruel whims of the Gentry. It is a place to rediscover lost love and to kindle inspiration anew; once more the wonderous melodies of Chopin and Vivaldi springs eagerly from her fingertips, filling bustling concert halls as well as abandoned stages. Hardly the traditional courtier of the Emerald Court - partying is simply too much a distraction from her passion - she believes it important each and every one of the Lost finds the one thing that fills their soul with light and makes the heart sing with joy.%0a%0a%25center%25 https://i.imgur.com/lrUxFLy.jpg%0a[[%3c%3c]][[%3c%3c]]%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=30px margin-right=15px width=340 margin-bottom=5px margin-left=10px newwin%25 [[https://i.imgur.com/Xv0WxkC.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/zQgFQ0g.jpg]]%0a!!! %25changeling%25 Role Playing Hooks:%0a%0a%25changeling%25 '''''Haunting beauty and heavy-hearted passion (Arts and Society):'''''\\%0a%25%25 Anastasia's greatest love in life is classical music, a calling that flows through her veins and comes alive at her fingertips.
