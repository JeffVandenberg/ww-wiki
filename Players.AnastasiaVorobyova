She has taken a personal interest in the local orchestras, auditioning for and performing with some of the city's most accomplished musicians and conductors. She even does some composing herself, conveying both an exuberant ''joie de vivre'' and poignant yearning and pining with her music — ever a reminder to the audience to embrace the joys that life has to offer before it is too late.%0a> %0a> %25changeling%25 '''''New comraderies to indulge new experiences (Lost):'''''\\%0a> %25%25 She has taken it upon herself to keep the rut and stagnation of everyday routine at bay; she regularly forces herself to step out of her comfort zone to try her hands at something she has never tried before, eagerly inviting other Lost to do the same. It is an opportunity to expand one's horizons, a possibility to find something new and exciting never experienced before. Anastasia also view these activities as team building exercises of sorts, a chance for her to improve relations with courtiers of the Antler Crown and other seasonal courts alike.%0a> [[%3c%3c]] %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=15px margin-right=15px width=325 margin-bottom=5px margin-left=10px newwin%25 [[https://i.imgur.com/4RY0Lkp.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/kG46cMe.jpg]]%0a> %0a> %25changeling%25 '''''Memories lost amidst brambles and thorns (Lost):'''''\\%0a> %25%25 There were things that were lost during the escape, when hostile vegetation coiled around arms and feets, violently ''ripping'' fragments of her very soul from her being. Thorns that tore at her flesh, clawing at her mind, every step impeded by branches and vines. Perhaps some of these missing parts are still out there, waiting to be recovered? Anastasia is eager to venture out to search for Icons, although she is ill equipped to do so on her own. Other Lost with interests in the Hedge would be suitable companions for an expedition.%0a> %0a> %25changeling%25 '''''No place like home (anyone):'''''\\%0a> %25%25 Although she lives in Miami now, Anastaisa cherishes her roots and heritage, still celebrating the holidays of her childhood and treating herself to a shot of ''Beluga'' vodka every once in a while. She will always take some time out of her day to stop and talk with one of her fellow countrymen, whether a new arrival to the states or a descendant of past Russian immigrants. She might even extend an invitation for dinner, treating her newfound friends to the old family recipe for ''borshch'' — a recipe that earned acclaim even amongst her friends back in St Petersburg.%0a> [[%3c%3c]]%0a> %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=10px margin-right=15px width=325 margin-bottom=5px margin-left=10px newwin%25 [[https://i.imgur.com/0vw6JH4.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/9DTDSov.jpg]]%0a> %25changeling%25 '''''Caretaker of the abandoned and unwanted (anyone):'''''\\%0a> %25%25 Anastasia has a particularly soft spot for animals, particularly those abandoned or mistreated by their owners; perhaps she is prone to projecting her own experiences unto these pets, valiantly and unwaveringly insisting they must be cared for and tended to. She spends a fair bit of time at local animal shelters, volunteering time and money to help ensure they get an as good life as possible. So come on down and adopt a pet today, or at the very least offer some scritches and snacks — dogs are man's best friend after all, and cats are pretty awesome too.%0a> %0a> %25changeling%25 '''''Waystation membership card (anyone):'''''\\%0a> %25%25 Ever since hearing of the Waystation member area, Anastasia has made sure to check in every so often and makes visits on a somewhat regular basis. Part of it is a curiosity about the other brands of supernaturals, but mostly she is interested in ensuring that cordial relations are established between the Freehold and the other communities that exist in Miami. Indeed, her interest in the Waystation comes more from a mediator's perspective than that of a politician's, eager to make friends with like-minded individuals regardless of their... origins.%0a> [[%3c%3c]][[%3c%3c]][[%3c%3c]]%0a> !!! %25changeling%25 Rumours:%0a> %0a> %25changeling%25'''''The Tithe:''''' \\%0a> %25%25 It is said her very own ''baboushka'' sent her off to the Others, a tithe paid for an ancient bargain. Gossip claims that the old crone was a Loyalist send to mislead carefree youngsters, nay, a Lost that had made a thoughtless pledge, nay, she was the wicked witch, the ''Baba Yaga'', that lured misbehaving children into the forest at night. A cruel fate indeed, to be pawned off to the Fae by one's own flesh and blood, and yet the Wyrd demands that promises made be upheld. Hopefully, the tithe has been paid in full and no one else will be sent to endure the Gentry's cruel whims.%0a> %0a> %25changeling%25 '''''The Two Keepers:'''''\\%0a> %25%25 Is she truly one of the twice-escaped, a Lost that made their way home after serving two different Keepers? One story asserts that the pianist planned an escape from the fair '''Elven Queen''', but was betrayed by one of the other escapees and ended up amongst the granite halls of the '''Troll Prince'''; another that her original Keeper merely bored of her and traded her for a fanciful token spun in the Hedge; and a third that two Gentry placed their favourite servants on a chessboard and every piece eliminated from their opponent's side became their new possession.%0a> %0a> %25changeling%25 '''''The Fetch:'''''\\%0a> %25%25 The fetch was  cobbled together from debris at hand; shattered shards of glass for eyes; mud and twigs for flesh and bones; and some wicked fae magic for soul. Now it stalks the halls of the University of Miami, mahogany-haired and aloof, claiming to once have had a talent at the piano. She is a freshman year girl, much younger than Anastasia herself. Where did all those years go in the Hedge? How long was she really stuck in Arcadia? Some seem to think the Fairest has sworn a vow of vengeance upon the ''thing'' that took her place, others insist she has decided to leave her old life behind.%0a> %0a> %25changeling%25 '''''The Kindred:'''''\\%0a> %25%25 Hushed whispers of the vampires' dark compulsions tell of misfortune that befell the Fairest; it is said one of the Kindred sank their proverbial claws and literal fangs into her, fettering her soul to theirs. Gossip claims it was a Contract of the undead's own design that enchained her, or perhaps a quaff of their lifeless blood — unholy ambrosia, sweeter than nectar and an invisble collar around the neck, insidiously bending the victim's will to the Kindred's own. Few know the details of the events that transpired, but rumours agree it nearly shattered her chance at true love.%0a> %0a> %25changeling%25 '''''A rumour:'''''\\%0a> %25%25 Another rumour goes here. Is it true, or is it false?%0a> [[%3c%3c]][[%3c%3c]][[%3c%3c]]%0a> %25center%25 [[https://i.imgur.com/6HxDwTP.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/5SLbeSL.jpg]]%0a> %0a> !!! %25changeling%25 Quotes:%0a

It is all a mirage of the human variety, a woman recast from the broken shards of her past, every flaw and blemish meticulously expunged — in their absence a Fairest was fashioned.%0a> %0a> The '''Mien''' then a truer reflection of the Gentry's designs, every feature, every gesture, every last inch of her transformed in the realm beyond the Thorns. A woman of elvenkind the, like the denizens of ''Álfheimr'' or the faerie mounds of the Seelie, with pointed ears and intense eyes that seem to pierce through flesh and bone to gaze at the very soul itself. There is a faint shimmer to her pale skin, a gentle moonlight glow filtering through her very being, subtle yet everpresent. %0a> %0a> Verdant scents trail in the wake of her lissome form, willowy limbs suffused in the refreshing tones of the Emerald Court's '''Mantle'''; dew-ladened grass at the break of dawn; sap rising through birches in spring; and forest meadows of wild anemones in bloom. %0a> [[%3c%3c]][[%3c%3c]][[%3c%3c]] %0a> !!! %25changeling%25 History:%0a> For those that are taken, there is an edge of maddening desperation to Faerie's wonder; it holds an intensity that has every emotion magnified, unearthly pleasures elevated by beauty that can not be put into words. How then could the Winter Palace or the ''Barge Haulers on the Volga'' hold up to the fey delights of Arcadia? No, this world exemplifies trivial banality compared to the grandeur of the fairytale realm. Few would have sought their way back here, had it not been for the unspeakable pains and abuse suffered at the hands of a Keeper. And so that intensity of Faerie turned all to quickly into severity instead; the harmony of the symphony is marred by a single key pressed at the wrong moment and panic bubbled up within; the exuberance of composing a new piece faded into into fearful and frustrated tears when her Keeper deemed it unworthy; and the pride and joy of conjuring music out of nothing but her hands and her imagination drowned slowly in the shallows of the Durance.%0a> %0a> How much is freedom worth? How steep a cost for a second chance at life? Some questions are better left unspoken, some thoughts better left alone. Miami is a sanctuary, a haven to heal and recover from the capricious and cruel whims of the Gentry. It is a place to rediscover lost love and to kindle inspiration anew; once more the wonderous melodies of Chopin and Vivaldi springs eagerly from her fingertips, filling bustling concert halls as well as abandoned stages. Hardly the traditional courtier of the Emerald Court - partying is simply too much a distraction from her passion - she believes it important each and every one of the Lost finds the one thing that fills their soul with light and makes the heart sing with joy.%0a> %0a> %25center%25 [[https://i.imgur.com/5I5NKFA.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/lrUxFLy.jpg]]%0a> [[%3c%3c]][[%3c%3c]][[%3c%3c]]%0a
