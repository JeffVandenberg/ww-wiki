Her hair is always found dyed a vibrant blue with deep violet colored ends.  Her fashion leans on the side of dark, usually with some kind of black dress or clothing that accentuates her athletic form, but tastefully.  She is usually found in makeup, which just like her look evolves to fit the social occasion or place she finds herself at.  Despite living in Miami her skin is pale in color and she can sometimes be found carrying a parasol during the day in order to keep it that way.  From looking at her it is obvious to see she is of mixed heritage, though it's hard to place.%0a%0aWhat stands out most about her, however, is her voice.  A soft dulcet alto that just carries around a room without heavy projection.  When she speaks it's easy to listen to, and hard not to pay attention.  When she's done speaking, people walk away feeling better, even inspired.  This carries over into her singing, which when she sings with her band can bring drama or a dash of opera to the screaming and fast guitar rifts, but also carries over to when she sings Jazz, surrounding listeners in a velvety blanket of feeling.%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Gallery'''%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #707070'  margin-left=10px width=215px%25 https://i.imgur.com/2mOUYDZ.jpg%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #707070'  width=215px%25 https://i.imgur.com/oAdm2lA.jpg%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #707070'  width=220px%25 https://i.imgur.com/kp7SbZH.jpg%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #707070'  width=215px%25 https://i.imgur.com/vESU2Kg.jpg%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Contacts'''%0a%0a||! %25mortal%25Image ||! %25mortal%25Name ||! %25mortal%25Relationship ||! %25mortal%25Comment ||! %25mortal%25Ringtone ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Hooks'''%0a%0a!!!!%25mortal%25 ''Professional Metal Goddess (Music Lovers/Entertainment)'': %0aShe has been at every club in Miami, grungy and high class.  She is in a quickly rising in popularity metal band named "Midnight Veil."  She sings primarily the clean vocals in the band, but sometimes surprises fans with guttural growls and shouts before seamlessly returning to her melodic tones.  If you read Revolver, love music, or are just in the entertainment  scene you may have at least seen or read an article about her, if not seen her perform.%0a%0a!!!!%25mortal%25 ''Hobbyist Occult Seeker (Occultists, Ghost Hunters, Supernatural Characters)'': %0aVampires and ghosts and demons, Oh My!  Being surrounded by so many weird people in the metal business makes one become naturally more curious about their interesting beliefs and stories, and Jessica has definitely fallen "victim" to this.  She has been bitten by the occult bug, and even has a minor in theology with a focus in pagan rites.  She is constantly seeking the truth, sometimes she'd argue for truths sake, but it's more for knowledge and the thrill that touching the unknown and dark could bring.%0a%0a!!!!%25mortal%25 ''Night Life (Clubbers, City)'': %0aMiami has some of the best clubs in all of the country.  Ocean view locales with beautiful people everywhere.  Jessica is with them every night she isn't studying some occult lead, whether she is performing in one of the clubs or just drinking and dancing the night away.  She loves club hopping and making a game of trying to get into as many different styled clubs in a night as she can and of course she is always willing to drag people kicking and screaming with her.%0a%0a!!!!%25mortal%25 ''Spirituality Through Fitness (Health Nuts, Medical, Wushu Enthusiasts)'': %0aGrowing up with a physical trainer as a father made Jessica respect the body as a temple, and due to her occult background she even takes it a step farther.  Taoist alchemy speaks of the humors of the body and mastering oneself to become more in tune with the energies around you.  She practices yoga and does wushu she learned as a kid regularly and goes running on the paths around Miami and on the beach in order to stay fit and healthy.  %0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a(:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a%0a(:cellnr width=100%25:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Quotes'''%0a%0a%25mortal%25 "Magick is an art; using reality and the world as its canvas." - Dacha Avelin \\%0a%0a%0a(:tableend:)%0a%0a(:include GameRef.Directoryplayermortal:)
