It's not really a change, so much as his interests taking him to stranger and stranger places. If he's seen at all it isn't for long, typically showing signs of self abuse. A few topics might bore him more than others, but he holds a conversation even in mild disinterest. Talk of cabals or territory are either met with humor or are ignored. The man is known for being drawn to art and good food like a moth, now that his secret war is over. Not looking too far into things or looking back has mellowed him out quite a bit, but those scars might never heal.%0a%0a! %25center%25https://i.imgur.com/ZrIs2Zv.png%0a||! %25color=#B7410E%25Image ||! %25color=#B7410E%25Name ||! %25color=#B7410E%25Comment ||! %25color=#B7410E%25Ringtone ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/et6NFTX.jpg || %25color=#B7410E%25[[MalcolmUrLockheart|Ur]] || %25mage%25 Oh shit, man.

diff:1530044341:1530043403:=53c53%0a%3c %25center%25 Fluke is by and large detached from either side of society. It's not really a change, so much as his interests taking him to stranger and stranger places. If he's seen at all it isn't for long, typically showing signs of self abuse. A few topics might bore him more than others, but he holds a conversation even in mild disinterest. Talk of cabals or territory are either met with humor or are ignored. The man is known for being drawn to art and good food like a moth, now that his secret war is over. Not looking too far into things or looking back has mellowed him out quite a bit, but those scars might never heal.%0a---%0a> %25center%25 Fluke is busy! >:3%0a
