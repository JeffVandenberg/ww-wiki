No he doesn't need a place to stay. Yes he knows where it is. No he doesn't go to Consilium or Assemblies anymore. The last missing person's case was an elaborate prank to humiliate him and waste his time. He no longer works requisitions, he doesn't pay for drinks at your bar, and he never takes anyone home with him. It's not that he's a dick to any one faction, or even that he doesn't believe in a communal effort.
