She stands at 5’6 with long white hair and cloudy eyes. Maybe they were once gray or blue? It’s difficult to tell now. Her eyesight seems to be fading, though she doesn’t have too much trouble getting around as her other senses are heightened and she has the aid of an orange tabby that follows her around. Vanessa is often clad in gothic-style dresses and a cape when she is working or performing rituals. Otherwise, she can be found in simple combinations of jeans and t-shirts. %0a%0a%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%25center%25%25newwin%25http://i64.tinypic.com/6oiq6x.png\\%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=17px margin-right=16px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=8px width=315 newwin%25https://i.imgur.com/BXfce3E.png\\%0a%0a%25vampire%25 Fortune Teller (Everyone) - %25white%25 Vanessa can often be found downtown and at various events, doing fortune tellings and palm readings for a rather reasonable price. \\%0a%0a%25vampire%25 Wicked Witch of the West (Supernatural) - %25white%25 Vanessa is a skilled ritualist and sometimes might be reminiscent of a a witch you might see on TV or read about in books. She certainly isn't as scary looking as some of them are and maybe that's something scary all on its own.\\%0a%0a%25vampire%25 New in Town (Vampire) - %25white%25 Vanessa is among one of the newer arrivals in Portland.  She is a member of the Circle of the Crone, and while she seems well versed in most of their teachings, her understanding of the way Kindred society works as a whole seems to be very minimal.\\%0a%0a%25vampire%25 Blind as a Bat (Everyone) - %25white%25 Vanessa is going blind, or maybe she already is blind. It's kind of hard to tell.

She stands at 5’6 with long white hair and cloudy eyes. Maybe they were once gray or blue? It’s difficult to tell now. Her eyesight seems to be fading, though she doesn’t have too much trouble getting around as her other senses are heightened and she has the aid of an orange tabby that follows her around. Vanessa is often clad in gothic-style dresses and a cape when she is working or performing rituals. Otherwise, she can be found in simple combinations of jeans and t-shirts. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c %25center%25%25newwin%25http://i64.tinypic.com/6oiq6x.png\\%0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=17px margin-right=16px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=8px width=315 newwin%25https://i.imgur.com/BXfce3E.png\\%0a%3c %0a%3c %25vampire%25 Fortune Teller (Everyone) - %25white%25 Vanessa can often be found downtown and at various events, doing fortune tellings and palm readings for a rather reasonable price. \\%0a%3c %0a%3c %25vampire%25 Wicked Witch of the West (Supernatural) - %25white%25 Vanessa is a skilled ritualist and sometimes might be reminiscent of a a witch you might see on TV or read about in books.
