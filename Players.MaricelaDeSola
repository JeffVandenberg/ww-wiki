Round north Chinese features are prominent in her face, which she often makes up brilliantly in sparkles and colors to match her wardrobe.

"%0a> %0a> Izabella was born in china, an unwanted daughter but as luck would have it, and she was very lucky, adopted to a wealthy cuban family in Florida that were unable to have children of her own. Renamed from her original name of Qilin to Isabella Gracia she had a great childhood, her new parents were kind and loving, gave her a great education she never particularly payed attention to, and was sheltered from most of the wicked things of the world until the day THEY came for her. The day she disappeared.

She didn't think it was a big deal walking alone frlm school, and even though she was told not to talk to strangers she didn't think it was so bad if it was a kid like her right? She saw the kid there playing with her toys as alone as she was, she ran up to her, they played together for HOURS forgetting the time, she offered Izzy one of her toys, anyone she wanted. Izzy chose a unicorn, and when she took it the child offered her hand instead. When they walked away together she left at the playground a doll that looked just like her new best friend. Her name was Grace then, grace the unicorn. They ran and jumped and played all day. The Princess cared for her, she fed her and combed her, they were inseparable. The Princess blessed her with incredible powers too, to help in their games. Rare was any of The Princess' friends more blessed than Grace the Unicorn. Somehow though, it all went wrong.

Dont ask me to talk about THEM. "%0a%3c %0a%3c Izabella was born in china, an unwanted daughter but as luck would have it, and she was very lucky, adopted to a wealthy cuban family in Florida that were unable to have children of her own. Renamed from her original name of Qilin to Isabella Gracia she had a great childhood, her new parents were kind and loving, gave her a great education she never particularly payed attention to, and was sheltered from most of the wicked things of the world until the day THEY came for her.

She didn't think it was a big deal walking alone frlm school, and even though she was told not to talk to strangers she didn't think it was so bad if it was a kid like her right? She saw the kid there playing with her toys as alone as she was, she ran up to her, they played together for HOURS forgetting the time, she offered Izzy one of her toys, anyone she wanted. Izzy chose a unicorn, and when she took it the child offered her hand instead. When they walked away together she left at the playground a doll that looked just like her new best friend. Her name was Grace then, grace the unicorn. They ran and jumped and played all day. The Princess cared for her, she fed her and combed her, they were inseparable.
