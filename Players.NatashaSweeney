She has a long, narrow nose and rich, full lips that are sometimes left un-tinted by cosmetics. Her eyebrows are neatly manicured into a rounded arch of dark brown. Her build is athletic, with feminine curves that cause her to have a bit of an hourglass form when she isn't wearing baggy clothes.

Her hair descends in curls to her mid-back, and is dyed a soft, almost pastel green, with a blending of darker and lighter shades giving an almost light turquoise or jade-like appearance. She has a long, narrow nose and rich, full lips that are left un-tinted by cosmetics. Her eyebrows are neatly manicured into a rounded arch of golden blonde. Her build is athletic, with feminine curves that cause her to have a bit of an hourglass form. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a94c94%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://imgur.com/ebUzXtq || %25thumb%25https://imgur.com/fgoWHMJ || %25thumb%25https://imgur.com/7Q2tJyO || %25thumb%25https://imgur.com/skBbhMg || %25thumb%25https://imgur.com/7f4au4p || %25thumb%25https://imgur.com/N7nThJZ ||%0a---%0a> || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png ||%0a99,104c99%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png ||%0a%3c (:tableend:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a%3c (:cellnr width=100%25:)%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png ||%0a---%0a> || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png ||%0a
