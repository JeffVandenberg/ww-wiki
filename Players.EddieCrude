His facial hair seems always perfect, and his wide nose seems to fit well above his constant slight smile.%0a59c54%0a%3c %25color=#5D8236%25It's in his mask that the blight is seen–his body is thinner, but there's a layer of black toxic fumes that ripple and flow around his body that makes him ''seem'' a lot bigger and more imposing. His thin body underneath seems to be made of crude oil and shards of coal-like rock. He radiates an uneasy sense of plague and blight, which is a very strange contrast when he wields his skills as a Chatelaine, making him suddenly very likable.%0a---%0a> %25color=#5D8236%25Silenus towers when the scales are lifted from one's eyes to see the truth. The gigantic man could almost be many things. The horns seem to say satyr, but the horse hooves say centaur. The long elven ears would claim him for those fair beings, but the vines crawling across his arms, crisscrossed with so many cuts like someone had tried to hack his way through the man with a machete tell a much different story. The blue eye seems to hold some sapphire shrapnel that he seems to not mind even if it doesn't let his eye close all the way. %0a63c58%0a%3c %25color=#5D8236%25His mantle is still small and subtle--there's a heat that radiates off of him, and sometimes the air around him shimmers and blurs, like the air coming off of hot pavement in the Summer. %0a---%0a> %25color=#5D8236%25The former centaur's mantle is a subtle thing. The room seems to brighten as if with a gentle sunrise peeking in through the window. Flowering plants open wider with his passing, turning ever so slightly towards him. His touch leaves a small tingle like the cooling feeling of a good mint.%0a

The 7'2 mask does its best, but he always seems to be about to bump his head into anything remotely dangling from the ceiling. The rest of it could have come off some sort of steamy pirate fantasy book - the long curly locks flowing over shoulders, the oddly veiny bulging arms, the strange blue and green set of heterochromatic eyes.
