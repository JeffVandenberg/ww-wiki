The air she carries herself with is something that will always draw someone in the natural center of attention that brings someone back over and over again. Her eyes friendly but knowing most of the time. Though to those who have seen her in Court knows the gaze can become as cold and indifferent as a sharks in a feeding frenzy. There are minute ways about her that seem timeless as classic as someone who's stood in a royal court yet as relaxed as someone who spends their time in a nightclub. She seems calm and collected at almost all times but once she lets off the airs as she calls it she becomes as rough and boisterous as the blue ocean itself. Yet in all situations she seems to have a natural air of command about her the natural ease with people that most will instinctively flock to in bad situations.A creature of contradiction like her lover the Sea she is giving and kind one moment and cold and unforgiving the next. Though the side she will almost always show in public is the kind and giving."%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #6e68a3' margin-top=8px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=20px margin-right=10px width=300%25https://i.imgur.com/uIEY54V.jpg%0a"Bloodless:The flesh pales even farther veins visible across the temples and cheeks her brown eyes dulling to a rust red the skin pulled taut over her musculature defining every muscle group in her body bringing the fearsome mien of the natural predator to the forefront.Her entire countenance changes instead of walking she will stalk a low roiling growl in her throat at all times.When they speak of riding the wave Clara is the epitome of which they speak bestial with the cunning of a human mind guiding the actions. She is the predator with the focus and drive to find and track her prey to their most believed safe zone.It is then that the predator strikes seizing the prey just as it relaxes the adrenaline slowly fading from their system.The vampire roams free thriving upon the hunt whether as predator or prey it is all in the visceral joy of the hunt.To rise to feed, to die in the gutter as the tables are turned it is purely in that moment that the truest test of existence is put on the line. Othertimes the monster clad in flesh will strike from nowhere and seemingly disappear only to strike again small strikes wounding and wearing down inexorably her chosen prey until it falls exhausted to accept it's fate. Embodiment of the Rime of the Ancient Mariner most directly the line" Like a man upon a lonesome road doth tread and having once turned round continues on and turns no more their head.For they know a fearsome fiend doth close behind them tread." In those moments she is no longer figure she strove so hard to develop and instead becomes the very embodiment of the centuries of pent up rage and frustrations that shaped her vengance, hunger, the hunt all of it combining to create the monster that she contains within."%0a[[%3c%3c]] %0a!!! %25vampire%25 History:%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #6e68a3' margin-top=8px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=20px margin-right=10px width=300%25https://i.imgur.com/KqKuquU.jpg%0aThe name Clara Valentine first appears in the birth ledgers of Nassau. The daughter of a brothel woman and a pirate she grew up in the roughest conditions of the time learning to steal and fight she more often than not dressed and behaved like a boy and when the time was right she stowed away on a ship.She was caught and lashed by the captain before being made to scrub and clean the ship or help the cook. Two months into the journey they were attacked and the ship was taken by Blackbeard himself she joined his crew and became a pirate from that day forward. From 1712 to early 1718 she grew up aboard The Queen Annes Revenge participating in murder when warranted, plunder, and piracy being small of stature she managed to pass for a fairly pretty man and with her cut of the plunder she bought the ship she stowed away upon from her Captain and Sailed off to Key West to obtain her crew. Upon hearing of Blackbeard's Capture and death several months later she set out to deliver bloody retribution attacking and sacking English ships with a zeal that made the name Captain Valentine one spoken of almost as much as that of Bartholomew Roberts and for seven years she became the last of the old guard of piracy gathering plunder, ships, and fame. In 1725 however the purported Pirate set anchor in Saint Augustine Florida and disappeared from the Annals of history.%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #6e68a3' margin-top=8px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=20px margin-right=10px width=400%25https://i.imgur.com/WrNdxts.jpg%0aThe truth of the matter was however much more complicated. Upon landing in Saint Augustine she bought a pardon from the Spanish and gave her ships over to the Spanish Authority as part of the bribe. It was also where she revealed to the governor of the city that she was indeed a woman. She bathed changed and walked to him as a proper lady being a beauty the Governor pardoned her and took her as his wife using her vast funds to help finish rebuilding the city from the British attack in 1702. She was married to him for just half a year before her sire found her Having recognized her immediately as the Pirate who had sailed into port he spoke with her and asked her to recount her tale for him. Mistaking him for a simple drunk fan she laughed and told him about her pirating years as Captain Valentine he turned her that night and brought her into a much bigger world of monsters. She managed to hide it from her husband for another decade until he died of pneumonia; confessing the truth to him before he died, her way of thanking him for the only happiness she had known outside of the sea. By then she had been part of the Invictus for years, drinking from one of their Enemies a Daeva named Gillicutty before ashing him. Actively using the business acumen she had learned from them and her husband to secure her future. In 1740 She was first put into Torpor, during Oglethorpe's attack and siege to her city. She awoke again in 1824 when she was disturbed by new construction going on over her head. In a hunger frenzy she slaughtered anyone nearby and after glutting on their blood, she gasped at the change she had seen. After adjusting for a couple more years she went back to her old investments, shifting them into new investments. This time building her empire slowly, keeping hidden and using proxies to get her work done. Once more she dressed and acted as a man, and when the Slaves came to Florida she secretly helped them get away. And protected the ones she knew were incapable of running by purchasing them and freeing them upon getting them to her estate paying them wages. She stayed active during the Civil War to protect what she seen as her people. Once it ended she sent each one off with a small bag of gold to start a new life. She even invested in the railroads when it came before once again setting things up for herself before finally letting herself slip into a peaceful slumber. When she awoke again in 1940 and acclimated herself to all the change around her she once more withdrew her holdings from the Invictus accounts and bought stocks in several new technologies and firms before boarding a train heading to Miami.%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #6e68a3' margin-top=8px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=20px margin-right=10px width=400%25https://i.imgur.com/cufjl64.jpg%0aHer time in Miami was interesting to say the least, She was cagey and implacable after properly introducing herself. Clara went about getting herself established mortal spheres of influence and vampiric circles making inroads of progress and garnering respect but something changed during the purge as silken brocade gave way to leather and steel once more and she had her fill she stayed more and more distant from the court proper until 1989 when the Pirate broke away from the Invictus after the Prince fell into Torpor, and joined the Carthians. Using the wealth generated by her investments she invested one more time and went into slumber in 1997. When she awoke again in 2012 she got herself acclimated once more and once her investments were taken care of she has kept an active presence in Miami and it's kindred circles.%0a%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]] %0a!!! %25Vampire %25 Hooks:%0a%0a!!!!%25vampire%25 ''Pirate(History Buffs, Vampires):'' %0aA historian might recognize the look of Clara while most of her history is hidden there are some works of art left that link the woman to the end of the golden age of piracy though it's highly doubtful most would be able to put the "young man" in the pictures to the woman who's out and about in the modern night as one in the same they could likely assume it is a relative.%0a%0a!!!!%25vampire%25 ''Bloody Valentine(Vampire):'' %0aDuring the Purge Clara was active it is known that she slew indiscriminately protecting her turf at the time She lost the territory when it was all said and done the Prince having removed it from her. Quite likely the reason she told the Invictus to shove off once the Prince went under. It was discovered during those times that it didn't take much for her fancy clothes to give way to steel and fang she was feared back then. The Carthians she joined still call the Gangrel Bloody Valentine when the animalistic ruthlessness starts to show through the mask she wears.%0a%0a!!!!%25vampire%25 ''Philanthropist(Everyone):'' %0aPublicly Clara Valentine is one of the wealthiest philanthropists in Miami giving vast sums of wealth to the impoverished of the city buying up businesses and starting them up to make sure the jobs help revive areas in need of it.  %0a%0a%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]] %0a(:tableend:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25vampire%25'''Contacts'''%0a%0a||! %25vampire%25Image ||! %25vampire%25Name ||! %25vampire%25Relationship ||! %25vampire%25Comment ||! %25vampire%25Ringtone ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/7rNzM0w.jpg || %25vampire%25Anahita Shahzad || %25vampire%25Acquaintance || %25vampire%25An interesting creature I would have hired them as crew back in the day. || %25newwin%25[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIO5G1w5T0g|%25vampire%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/eH7l3lo.png || %25vampire%25PC Name || %25vampire%25Relationship to PC || %25vampire%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25vampire%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/eH7l3lo.png || %25vampire%25PC Name || %25vampire%25Relationship to PC || %25vampire%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25vampire%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/eH7l3lo.png || %25vampire%25PC Name || %25vampire%25Relationship to PC || %25vampire%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25vampire%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/eH7l3lo.png || %25vampire%25PC Name || %25vampire%25Relationship to PC || %25vampire%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25vampire%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]] %0a!!! %25vampire%25 Quotes:%0a%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]] [[%3c%3c]] %0a(:keywords vampire, PC:)%0a(:include GameRef.Directoryplayervampire:)

The air she carries herself with is something that will always draw someone in the natural center of attention that brings someone back over and over again. Her eyes friendly but knowing most of the time. Though to those who have seen her in Court knows the gaze can become as cold and indifferent as a sharks in a feeding frenzy. There are minute ways about her that seem timeless as classic as someone who's stood in a royal court yet as relaxed as someone who spends their time in a nightclub. She seems calm and collected at almost all times but once she lets off the airs as she calls it she becomes as rough and boisterous as the blue ocean itself. Yet in all situations she seems to have a natural air of command about her the natural ease with people that most will instinctively flock to in bad situations.A creature of contradiction like her lover the Sea she is giving and kind one moment and cold and unforgiving the next. Though the side she will almost always show in public is the kind and giving."%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #6e68a3' margin-top=8px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=20px margin-right=10px width=300%25https://i.imgur.com/uIEY54V.jpg%0a%3c "Bloodless:The flesh pales even farther veins visible across the temples and cheeks her brown eyes dulling to a rust red the skin pulled taut over her musculature defining every muscle group in her body bringing the fearsome mien of the natural predator to the forefront.Her entire countenance changes instead of walking she will stalk a low roiling growl in her throat at all times.When they speak of riding the wave Clara is the epitome of which they speak bestial with the cunning of a human mind guiding the actions. She is the predator with the focus and drive to find and track her prey to their most believed safe zone.It is then that the predator strikes seizing the prey just as it relaxes the adrenaline slowly fading from their system.The vampire roams free thriving upon the hunt whether as predator or prey it is all in the visceral joy of the hunt.To rise to feed, to die in the gutter as the tables are turned it is purely in that moment that the truest test of existence is put on the line. Othertimes the monster clad in flesh will strike from nowhere and seemingly disappear only to strike again small strikes wounding and wearing down inexorably her chosen prey until it falls exhausted to accept it's fate. Embodiment of the Rime of the Ancient Mariner most directly the line" Like a man upon a lonesome road doth tread and having once turned round continues on and turns no more their head.For they know a fearsome fiend doth close behind them tread." In those moments she is no longer figure she strove so hard to develop and instead becomes the very embodiment of the centuries of pent up rage and frustrations that shaped her vengance, hunger, the hunt all of it combining to create the monster that she contains within."%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]] %0a%3c !!! %25vampire%25 History:%0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #6e68a3' margin-top=8px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=20px margin-right=10px width=300%25https://i.imgur.com/KqKuquU.jpg%0a%3c The name Clara Valentine first appears in the birth ledgers of Nassau. The daughter of a brothel woman and a pirate she grew up in the roughest conditions of the time learning to steal and fight she more often than not dressed and behaved like a boy and when the time was right she stowed away on a ship.She was caught and lashed by the captain before being made to scrub and clean the ship or help the cook. Two months into the journey they were attacked and the ship was taken by Blackbeard himself she joined his crew and became a pirate from that day forward. From 1712 to early 1718 she grew up aboard The Queen Annes Revenge participating in murder when warranted, plunder, and piracy being small of stature she managed to pass for a fairly pretty man and with her cut of the plunder she bought the ship she stowed away upon from her Captain and Sailed off to Key West to obtain her crew. Upon hearing of Blackbeard's Capture and death several months later she set out to deliver bloody retribution attacking and sacking English ships with a zeal that made the name Captain Valentine one spoken of almost as much as that of Bartholomew Roberts and for seven years she became the last of the old guard of piracy gathering plunder, ships, and fame. In 1725 however the purported Pirate set anchor in Saint Augustine Florida and disappeared from the Annals of history.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #6e68a3' margin-top=8px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=20px margin-right=10px width=400%25https://i.imgur.com/WrNdxts.jpg%0a%3c The truth of the matter was however much more complicated. Upon landing in Saint Augustine she bought a pardon from the Spanish and gave her ships over to the Spanish Authority as part of the bribe. It was also where she revealed to the governor of the city that she was indeed a woman. She bathed changed and walked to him as a proper lady being a beauty the Governor pardoned her and took her as his wife using her vast funds to help finish rebuilding the city from the British attack in 1702. She was married to him for just half a year before her sire found her Having recognized her immediately as the Pirate who had sailed into port he spoke with her and asked her to recount her tale for him. Mistaking him for a simple drunk fan she laughed and told him about her pirating years as Captain Valentine he turned her that night and brought her into a much bigger world of monsters. She managed to hide it from her husband for another decade until he died of pneumonia confessing the truth to him before he died thanking him for the only happiness she had known outside of the sea. By then she had been part of the Invictus for years, drinking from one of their Enemies a Daeva named Gillicutty before ashing him ,and actively using the business acumen she had learned from them and her husband to secure her future. In 1740 She was first put into Torpor when Oglethorpe attacked and laid siege to her city. She awoke again in 1824 when she was disturbed by new construction going on over her head In a hunger frenzy she slaughtered anyone nearby and after glutting on their blood she gasped at the change she had seen. after adjusting for a couple more years she went back to her old investments and shifted them into new investments this time building her empire slowly keeping hidden and using proxies to get her work done she once more dressed and acted as a man and when the Slaves came she secretly helped them get away and protected what ones she could purchase she stayed active during the Civil War to protect what she seen as her people. Once it ended she set them free and sent each one off with a small bag of gold to start a new life. She even invested in the railroads when it came before once again setting things up for herself before finally letting herself slip into a peaceful slumber. When she awoke again in 1940 and acclimated herself to all the change around her she once more withdrew her holdings from the Invictus accounts and bought stocks in several new technologies and firms before boarding a train heading to Miami.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #6e68a3' margin-top=8px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=20px margin-right=10px width=400%25https://i.imgur.com/cufjl64.jpg%0a%3c Her time in Miami was interesting to say the least, She was cagey and implacable after properly introducing herself. Clara went about getting herself established mortal spheres of influence and vampiric circles making inroads of progress and garnering respect but something changed during the purge as silken brocade gave way to leather and steel once more and she had her fill she stayed more and more distant from the court proper until 1989 when the Pirate broke away from the Invictus after the Prince fell into Torpor, and joined the Carthians. Using the wealth generated by her investments she invested one more time and went into slumber in 1997. When she awoke again in 2012 she got herself acclimated once more and once her investments were once again taken care of she has kept an active presence in Miami and it's kindred circles.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[%3c%3c]] %0a%3c !!! %25Vampire %25 Hooks:%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25vampire%25 ''Pirate(History Buffs, Vampires):'' %0a%3c A historian might recognize the look of Clara while most of her history is hidden there are some works of art left that link the woman to the end of the golden age of piracy though it's highly doubtful most would be able to put the "young man" in the pictures to the woman who's out and about in the modern night as one in the same they could likely assume it is a relative.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25vampire%25 ''Bloody Valentine(Vampire):'' %0a%3c During the Purge Clara was active it is known that she slew indiscriminately protecting her turf at the time She lost the territory when it was all said and done the Prince having removed it from her.
