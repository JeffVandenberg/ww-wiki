Howell has a regal standing of authority, one honed from years on the bench as a judge.  He is immaculately dressed and speaks in a deep commanding baritone that easily carries across a room without resorting to raising his voice to uncomfortable or impolite levels. The one most striking part of his appearance is the most unsettling.  His eyes are always deeply bloodshot and left one slowly weeps blood, causing him to always have a handkerchief handy.

He arrived in Miami twelve years ago.  When asked why he decided to move to Miami, he offers the slightest of smiles and says “The same reason everyone relocates to Florida - to retire.”  He sits on the Inner Circle and the city’s Board of Directors, but other than that his actions have been relatively low key.  Occasionally granting a favor here or there and offering himself as a mediator and arbitrator of disputes to both those in the covenant and outside it.  His reputation is as it was in life, an exacting man who is more concerned with the letter of the law rather than the spirit, but one who applies that philosophy evenly in all matters before him. %0a%0a%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25vampire%25'''Hooks'''%0a%0a!!!!%25vampire%25 ''The Law Touches All(All):'' %0aAs the senior partner of the prestigious law firm, Howell, Collins, & Pettigrew, Wellington exerts considerable influence.
