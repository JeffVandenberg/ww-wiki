Howell has a regal standing of authority, one honed from years on the bench as a judge.  He is immaculately dressed and speaks in a deep commanding baritone that easily carries across a room without resorting to raising his voice to uncomfortable or impolite levels. The one most striking part of his appearance is the most unsettling.  His eyes are always deeply bloodshot and left one slowly weeps blood, causing him to always have a handkerchief handy.  This leads some mockingly call him Lord Handkerchief, but never to his face.  %0a%3c %0a---%0a> %25center%25 [Enter Here]%0a49,50c48,49%0a%3c %25center%25 When deprived of blood the unsettling judge becomes a true nightmare.  Skin sinks and turns sallow as it clings to his bones like dried out leather.  His lips peel back, revealing teeth and fangs.  His eyes go from merely bloodshot to blood red.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> %25center%25[Enter Here]%0a> %0a54,59c53,61%0a%3c !!%25center%25%25vampire%25'''Overview'''%0a%3c Howell was the first of a wave of powerful Estate newcomers to enter Miami.  It’s believed the others came at his personal request.  In life, he was a lawyer and then judge in New England, known to be strict and exacting in his application of the letter of the law, but even handed and fair in a hard sort of way.%0a%3c %0a%3c His requiem saw him move down to Atlanta in the aftermath of the Civil War.  He arrived in Miami twelve years ago.  When asked why he decided to move to Miami, he offers the slightest of smiles and says “The same reason everyone relocates to Florida - to retire.”  He sits on the Inner Circle and the city’s Board of Directors, but other than that his actions have been relatively low key.  Occasionally granting a favor here or there and offering himself as a mediator and arbitrator of disputes to both those in the covenant and outside it.  His reputation is as it was in life, an exacting man who is more concerned with the letter of the law rather than the spirit, but one who applies that philosophy evenly in all matters before him. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!%25center%25%25vampire%25'''Contacts'''%0a> %0a> ||! %25vampire%25Image ||! %25vampire%25Name ||! %25vampire%25Relationship ||! %25vampire%25Comment ||! %25vampire%25Ringtone ||%0a> || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/eH7l3lo.png || %25vampire%25PC Name || %25vampire%25Relationship to PC || %25vampire%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25vampire%25Ringtone]] ||%0a> || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/eH7l3lo.png || %25vampire%25PC Name || %25vampire%25Relationship to PC || %25vampire%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25vampire%25Ringtone]] ||%0a> || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/eH7l3lo.png || %25vampire%25PC Name || %25vampire%25Relationship to PC || %25vampire%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25vampire%25Ringtone]] ||%0a> || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/eH7l3lo.png || %25vampire%25PC Name || %25vampire%25Relationship to PC || %25vampire%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25vampire%25Ringtone]] ||%0a> || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/eH7l3lo.png || %25vampire%25PC Name || %25vampire%25Relationship to PC || %25vampire%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25vampire%25Ringtone]] ||%0a> %0a65,67c67,70%0a%3c !!!!%25vampire%25 ''The Law Touches All(All):'' As the senior partner of the prestigious law firm, Howell, Collins, & Pettigrew, Wellington exerts considerable influence.  His clients include captains of industry, financial institutions, and other pillars of society.  Many of whom are grateful for his legal counsel and willing to extend a favor or two his way.  %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25vampire%25 ''Mind Your Manners (Kindred):'' Wellington P. Howell is old school.  He's a stickler for manners and etiquette and views any breach of those values as a serious deficit of character.  Take care around the elder, and if you're wise you will never utter the name Lord Handkerchief in his presence.%0a---%0a> !!!!%25vampire%25 ''Hook 1(Who it effects):'' %0a> %0a> %0a> !!!!%25vampire%25 ''Hook 2(Who it effects):'' %0a70c73%0a%3c !!!!%25vampire%25 ''Necropolis (Nosferatu):'' Wellington is vastly wealthy and owns an estate on the oceanfront, a penthouse condo downtown, but his true home lies beneath the city.  He has built up a veritable fortress below the streets.  Those seeking an audience are often invited to come down below.  Guests are guided by his fellow Haunts through the darkened tunnels and sewers.  So far no one has managed to get lost in the labyrinth leading up to his stronghold, but it seems like such a convenient way for an inconvenient rival or troublesome upstart to be dispatched.  %0a---%0a> !!!!%25vampire%25 ''Hook 3(Who it effects):'' %0a
