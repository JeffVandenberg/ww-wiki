It should include the "Custom Equipment" template filled out. %0a*The Rulesmaster will return it with any changes to be made, or else will give you the roll to craft it. '''Do not roll before being told to!'''%0a*Upon a successful crafting and approval, it will be added to your sheet and this wiki. %0a*You are limited to one new piece of custom mundane equipment per month, but this is separate from the custom power limitation.%0a*Large projects represented by merits or unique stat blocks might fall out of this system and be handled differently, at staff discretion.%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25'''Guidelines'''%0a*Remember that custom items, especially weapons/armor, need to be balanced to existing equipment; there's always tradeoffs when adding to stats. %0a*As a rule, too, remember that General Armor and Weapon Rating are akin to bonus successes, and thus are more valuable (often about 2 to 1) than things like Defense penalties or Availability cost. %0a*Generally, start with the item closest to what you're trying to make, and adjust from there. %0a%0a!!!!%25center%25''Alterations''%0aYou may make minor alterations to weapons/armor listed here or in the books without submitting to the Rulesmaster queue for approval (submit to the Request Monitor queue as normal to craft it). This is limited to '''one of''' the following:%0a*Raise Weapon Rating, Range, Capacity, or General Armor by 1 by increasing Availability by 2, so long as this won't take Availability above 5.%0a*Raise Ballistic Armor, Initiative, Defense, or Speed by 1, or lower Strength by 1, by increasing Availability by 1, so long as this won't take Availability above 5 or make an Initiative, Defense, or Speed rating positive.%0a*Add a new Coverage to armor by raising Availability by 1 to a max of 5.%0a*Add one tag (or remove a negative one) that makes sense by increasing Availability by 1, to a max of 5.%0aMaking more than one change, a larger change, or making alternative tradeoffs all require that the object be submitted to the Rulesmaster request queue.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''General Equipment'''%0a%0aThese are pieces of equipment not from the book that will not need Rules Master approval if they follow the guidelines below, and will generally provide a dice bonus equal to half the Availability cost rounded up (similar to Fashion). %0a%0aGenerally, equipment in this section can be purchased without crafting it, unlike most customized equipment, so long as the staff feels a given specialty is justified as being something you can find in the store; you can't find reliable Repositories on specific supernatural topics like "Circle of the Crone," for instance.%0a%0aAnything already in the book as example equipment of course supersedes this general equipment.%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25''Instruments''%0a:Equipment Bonus: +1 to +3 (Half the Availability spent on it)%0a:Availability: As above%0a:Size: Varies as appropriate%0a*Instruments represents any sort of musical instrument or similar tools used by performers. A guitar, drum set, magician's toolkit, and DJ setup all fall under this category, and provide the usual equipment bonus based on availability.%0a*At ST discretion, more bulky and complex setups may provide an additional +1 bonus (Max 3) compared to normal for its Availability.%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25''Laboratories''%0a:Equipment Bonus: +1 to +3 (Half the Availability spent on it)%0a:Availability: As above%0a:Size: A full room, or Size 2 if portable (see below)%0a*Laboratories covers a varied number of research oriented rooms and setups geared to a scientific or academic focus of some kind. When buying a Laboratory, choose a mental skill specialty ("Research" and similar skill-agnostic specs should also be tied to a specific skill); they apply their equipment to research and development oriented tasks that relate to that specialty.%0a*By decreasing the provided equipment bonus by 1 (for the same Availability), you can create "Portable" labs that can be used anywhere with maybe a few minutes of setup.%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25''Repositories''%0a:Equipment Bonus: +1 to +3 (Half the Availability spent on it)%0a:Availability: As above%0a:Size: Size 5 or so (a small bookcase) if physical, but digital Repositories are possible and have the size of their containing electronics.%0a*Repositories are similar to Libraries, but are generally highly specialized, representing less effort made in creating a widespread, accessible Library, and more towards getting everything that can be found about one very specific subject. When putting together a "general" repository, choose a category that could likely be represented with a mental skill specialty (other than "Research" or similar action-based specialties, of course); this topic is what its bonus applies to.%0a*As normal, Repositories may stack with Libraries, up to a total between them of +5.%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25''Workshops''%0a:Equipment Bonus: +1 to +3 (Half the Availability spent on it)%0a:Availability: As above%0a:Size: A full room, or Size 2 if portable (see below)%0a*Unlike Laboratories, which tend to be keyed to research and scientific discovery, workshops are tied to some sort of crafting or creation. Upon purchasing a Workshop, choose a crafting-related specialty (It needn't be a Crafts one; Supernatural Equipment as an Occult Specialty is acceptable, for instance, as would be "Music Composition" for Expression). Its bonus applies to any crafting rolls made that fall within that specialty.%0a*Like Laboratories, 'portable' workshops can be put together in a large bag and take a few minutes to setup in any room with enough space for the type of crafting being done.%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25''Visual Artwork''%0a:Equipment Bonus: +1 to +3 (Half the Availability spent on it)%0a:Availability: As above%0a:Size: Varies as appropriate%0a*Visual Artwork represents many artistic endeavors that are meant to be set on display permanently and can otherwise be casually enjoyed solely with the sense of sight, not requiring a specific performance or a "run time" of any sort.%0a*The bonus is rarely tied to anything specific, and instead will apply to social bonuses for such things as socializing in its presence with someone who appreciates artwork, offering it as a gift, and so on. No specialization needs to be given, it just needs to be defined what exactly the Artwork is.%0a%0aEquipment that provides higher bonuses, a more widespread area it applies to, or that similarly varies from the above use the normal system for custom equipment.%0a%0aOther suggested options for General equipment should be sent in a Feedback request to the Rules Master group.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''Approved Equipment'''%0a%0aThis equipment must still be crafted by a given character; it can not be assumed to be available for purchase otherwise.%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25''Protective Amulet''%0a:Equipment Bonus: +2%0a:Availability: ���%0a:Size: 1%0a:Durability: 2%0aProtective Amulets protect against either "magic" in general (representing all 'spells' and 'rituals'), or a specific type of creature's supernatural powers (like spiritual powers, for instance), chosen upon creation.
