While the thrift shop is open to anyone, the bar itself is closed to members of the All Night Society and their guests. Delilah took the idea of a speakeasy and married it with vampiric needs. Instead of selling illegal liquor, she sells blood. All sorts of blood can be found from the blood dolls the servers have access to. Want to imbibe the blood of someone who's drunk - can be done.

The dot rating reflects the retainer’s relative competency. One-dot retainers are barely functional, children, or otherwise not very effective. Three-dot retainers are typically professionals, with some impressive but not overwhelming abilities at their disposal. Five-dot retainers are true experts, the best in their class.%0a%0a%25left%25If a retainer must roll for an action, double the Retainer Merit dots and use them as a dice pool for any action core to his primary focus or concept. For example, an auto mechanic would get that on Crafts or perhaps Drive rolls. For other rolls, use the Merit rating by itself as a dice pool. Additionally, a Retainer can have access to twice the Merit dots in her own Merits. These are limited to Merits that don’t create additional Storyteller Characters — your Retainer can’t have a Retainer, who then has another Retainer, for example.

The actual location, the luxury, and the size are represented by equipment. A one-dot Safe Place might be equipped with basic security systems or a booby trap at the windows and door. A five-dot could have a security crew, infrared scanners at every entrance, or trained dogs. Each place could be an apartment, a mansion or a hidey-hole.%0a%0a%25left%25Unlike most Merits, multiple characters can contribute dots to a single Safe Place, combining their points into something greater. A Safe Place gives an Initiative bonus equal to the merit dots. This only applies to a character with dots invested in the Safe Place.%0a%0a%25left%25Any efforts to breach the Safe Place suffer a penalty equal to the Merit dots invested. If the character desires, the Safe Place can include traps that cause intruders lethal damage equal to a maximum of the Merit rating (player’s choice as to how much damage a given trap inflicts). This requires that the character has at least a dot in Crafts. The traps may be avoided with a Dexterity + Larceny roll, penalized by the Safe Place dots.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25color=#008080%25STAFF: 2 (Servers: Socialize, Security: Brawl)%0a%25left%25'''Effect''': Your character has a crew of workers or assistants at her disposal.

While the thrift shop is open to anyone, the bar itself is closed to members of the All Night Society and their guests. Delilah took the idea of a speakeasy and married it with vampiric needs. Instead of selling illegal liquor, she sells blood. All sorts of blood can be found from the blood dolls the servers have access to. Want to imbibe the blood of someone who's drunk - can be done. Drugs? No problem. Someone lost in ectasy? Easy. This is the place to go for discreet feeding - at least for a price.%0a%3c %0a%3c (:tableend:)   %0a%3c %0a%3c (:table valign=top:)%0a%3c (:cellnr width=700 colspan=2 align=center:)%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ! %25center%25%25color=#008080%25Vintage Threads%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Room Name: (NE)Forgotten Threads%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25The Forgotten Threads takes items on consignment for no more than one month, if the item doesn't sell by then the owner is called and asked to pick it up. This keeps the Forgotten Threads from having to have a back room and cuts down on clutter. The only person that seems to work at the Forgotten Threads is a perpetually tired looking woman in her mid to late forties that has serious 'mom look' vibes and a strong preference for anything 1970s or earlier. Yes, she is not a fan of your most recent high school prom dress, she wants your grandmother's. According to the name on her tag it says Pam, but occasionally she'll tell people her name is really  Wilhelmina but the boss didn't like it so has decided to call her Pam instead.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25If you are in the know and have been given the codeword, Pam will push a button beneath the counter she leans against - and  yes, Pam will protect this button with her life. If you think Pam is just a tired looking mom then you will be surprised to find out that Pam can probably kick your butt into next week. She's got no time for your bullshit, she has a boss that gives her enough shit to shovel already.%0a%3c %0a%3c !! %25center%25%25color=#008080%25Gallery%0a%3c || %25newwin thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/Vy65s8k.jpg || %25newwin thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/eiMnuUv.jpg || %25newwin thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/YMpD3nC.jpg || %25newwin thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/NCvxZDo.jpg || %25newwin thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/i9OFwzc.jpg || %25newwin thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/slpTUCy.jpg || %0a%3c %0a%3c ! %25center%25%25color=#008080%25The Vampire Bar%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Room Name: (NE)The Forgotten Midnight%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25Room PW: Vitae%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25%25red%25Any vampire, ghoul, or dhampir can become a member. You don't need to have a scene to be recognized by Pam and allowed in the back. A member in good standing (City Status 1+) may with permission from one of the owners be allowed to bring in a guest - but they must stay with their guest at all times while they are inside of the bar. So feel free to come in and play if you want.%25%25%0a%3c %0a%3c The door in the back leads to the bar itself. The Forgotten Midnight is decked out in retro 1970's fittings, from the couches to the chairs, to even the vintage Marlboro sign and rustic stuffed animal heads, to the green color soaked everywhere. There are plenty of chairs, seats, and booths where people can congregate and even have private conversations. Here is where the members of the All Night Society can gather and let their hair down. The servers and security staff are all ghouled or young vampires looking for a way to spend their nights. Let a server know what sort of drink you want, and a blood doll will be brought to you - glass optional.  %0a%3c %0a%3c !! %25center%25%25color=#008080%25Gallery%0a%3c || %25newwin thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/377rkGU.png || %25newwin thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/NvZ1OW7.png || %25newwin thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/4n8Jk9N.png || %25newwin thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/qXucEMQ.png || %25newwin thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/eogRrb7.png ||%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !! %25center%25%25color=#008080%25Rules For The Forgotten Midnight%25%25%0a%3c These rules are explained by Pam when a member first joins. There are no exceptions to the rules as presented and no excuses are allowed. Ignorance is not an exception to the rules in this area, failure to follow the rules will lead to being banned from the property for 1 month, 3 months, and permanently.%0a%3c %0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c %0a%3c Rule 1: You must request a blood doll from a server and pay for the time. You cannot just grab servers or blood dolls for yourself. [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c Rule 2: No feeding off of guests unless your server is alerted that you will do so and both parties agree to the feeding. [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c No feeding of unwilling partners. [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c Rule 3: No feeding off of the Servers. This is non-negotiable. [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c Rule 4: Do not bring mortals (non-Mortal+ that is) to the bar. [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c Rule 5: There is to be no fighting within the bar or on the property. If you cannot work out your issues in a civilized way you will be escorted roughly off the property by the security staff. [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c Rule 6: If you break it (or kill it) you buy it.
