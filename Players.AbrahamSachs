He quickly mastered his first set of coils and seemed poised to contribute mightily to the Great Work.  But as Daeva are known to do, he began to lose interest in the Great Work, in the countless hours buried in books and darkened labs.  His contributions became less and less frequent and his work less and less impressive.  Shoddy was a word frequently used when his name came up.  Eventually he was cast out of the Dying Light.  %0a%0aThe local Dragons chuckled when this wash out announced he was seeking to join the Sworn of the Mysteries.  He was rejected.  Twelve years later he applied again.  He was rejected.  Twenty four years later, he tried again.  This time his persistence paid off and from there, Abraham began a swift rise in the ranks of the Mysteries. He took to politics on behal of his fellow Dragons like a duck takes to water.  %0a%0aHe is now one of the premier Oracles of the Ordo and was chosen by his fellow Dragons to represent the covenant on the Board of Directors. %0a%0a%0a%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25vampire%25'''Hooks'''%0a%0a!!!!%25vampire%25 ''Looking for a Good Cause (Charity):'' %0a%0a %0a!!!!%25vampire%25 ''Stability (Kindred):'' %0aAbraham favors stability in the political realm above all else.
