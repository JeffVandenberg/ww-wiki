Spines protrude in a row down his spine, his nails long, sharp and black. His voice is ruined by his bodies lack of need of it, his lips barely enough to seal his mouth in the rare times it's not simply open. Long starvation has shriveled his torso and exacerbated his ribcage past conventional mortal limits. Long, strong spindly limbs, his shoulder's broad, his movements graceful and almost always silent. His very dark skin is splotched, scar-ravaged, burned in places, riddled with bulletmarks, and almost always covered in... something. Typically wearing now ragged clothes with a hood and trenchcoat. There is no hiding from any eyes, ignorant or not, that this creature exists more or less to eat you, and nothing else. %0a%0a----%0a%0a!! %25bgcolor=black vampire%25Contacts%0a%0a(:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a%0a(:cellnr width=360px:) %25lfloat width=150%25 https://i.imgur.com/UXeWl.jpg%0a%25vampire%25[[SissyGigglefitsFitzgerald|Cousin Sissy]]\\%0a%25white%25 Paul and Sissy found one another quickly and easily after he surfaced.
