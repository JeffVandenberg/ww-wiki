Even with his skin flushed with blood, he is still very pale. Made even more so by the make up he wears. He rarely goes out without it, dolled up in a full glam-goth look. His hair, dyed black, is usually swept to the side or carefully tussled. He dresses very well, usually in high-end goth attire, but sometimes will dress up in sleek dark suits. Even then, he accessories to fit his aesthetic, that most would unironically call "vampy". He grins often, always finding something to be amused about. %0a%0a!!!!%25center%25%25vampire%25''Bloodless''%0a%25center%25The Beast comes out in the way he stares at people--like a wolf sizing up its prey. His skin pales to a bone-white color that clearly goes beyond the make up. His smiles fade into scowls, his manicured nails looking more like claws with how his hands often curl and clench. %0a%0a!!%25center%25%25vampire%25'''The Hounds'''%0aChow Mein is a massive chow chow who is almost always at Gael's side. The dog has a lion's mane of thick brown fur, with part of his left ear missing and some notable scars around his muzzle. The dog is always grumpy looking. While well trained, he doesn't open up to strangers easily and is very protective of Gael. He doesn't get along very well with other dogs.%0a%0a%25center%25https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/192550/assets/873720/iStock_000011984010_Small.jpg%0a%0aFedor is Gael's newest dog, a massive Caucasian Shepard. The two are still getting used to each other, but already has become protective of Gael--and Chow Mein, despite the chow chow only barely tolerating Fedor's presence.

He loves to be pet and play fetch with people. %0a%0a%25center%25https://66.media.tumblr.com/d6e27e96d4960cadb9e2098bb825f16e/5dbacadc97d0e3dd-79/s1280x1920/99c1586416edd95330650e7d43172eabf926ecb8.jpg%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25vampire%25'''Contacts'''%0a%0a||! %25vampire%25Image ||! %25vampire%25Name ||! %25vampire%25Relationship ||! %25vampire%25Comment ||! %25vampire%25Ringtone ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/TlkIuOC.jpg || %25vampire%25[[Ronen Krovopuskov]] || %25vampire%25Perfection|| %25vampire%25He's an arrogant ass, but you know...
