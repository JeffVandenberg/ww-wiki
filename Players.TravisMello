The place seems to diminish all within and force them into close quarters; those who attempt to escape the close but comfortable space find their way blocked - doors wont open, hallways are filled with mountains of sand and powerful winds hurl them back whence they came.%0a%0aMiami Beach House: https://i.imgur.com/blN4VkB.jpg%0a%0aAnd the Oasis Chamber: https://i.imgur.com/6Un08P1.jpg%0a%0aThis chamber attached to Travis' beach house is a desert oasis with numerous fruit trees bearing nutritious edibles; tents and shadecloths furnished with plush loungers, rugs and mounds of pillows have been laid around the sparkling water. A raging windstorm rumbles in the distance but welcome guests will find it stays on the horizon, only rolling in to unleash elemental fury when the Djinn who is master of the oasis commands it. Unwelcome guests will find the hurricane winds scour the flesh from their bones and the storm constantly prevents them from escaping, always bringing them back to the Oasis.%0a%0aThe Tennis Club Shack - Night Market%0ahttps://i.imgur.com/KepFAH0.jpg%0aMaterial side: The entrance to this chamber is at the far end of a tennis club, in a party shack where the lock is easily breakable. while middle to upper class there are probably people who break into it all the time. %0a%0aInside the Lair:  An arabian market right out of a fantasy story, stalls and streets closely-packed and razor winds cutting through the tight passages.%0a%0a%0a%25center%25%0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a%0a%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a----%0a%0a!!!!%25beast%25 ''Killin' the Game(Anyone)'':%0aA local boy, musical sensation and up-and-coming rapper and singer, Travis can often be found with his growing entourage either performing at or partying in local clubs. His entourage seems to be ever-present, always surrounding him with excitement and revelry. Do you know Travis from back in the day? Or maybe you are a friend or acquaintance of one of his hedonistic Entourage.%0a%0a!!!!%25beast%25 ''Whatcha need?(Anyone)'':%0aTravis can find seemingly anything you need (legal or otherwise) at excellent prices and is the man to talk to if you want to get your hands on something discreetly and cheaply.%0a%0a!!!!%25beast%25 ''Infamous(Anyone)'':%0aThere was a violent altercation between Travis and another rapper that ended, as rap beefs often do, in the other guy and his entire crew disappearing. It could never be proven that he was involved, but many people strongly suspect his hand in it.%0a%0a!!!!%25beast%25 ''Kind of a romantic (Anyone)'':%0aTravis is the romantic type and dates around quite a bit, but has yet to find that special someone.%0a%0a!!!!%25beast%25 ''Addictive Personality(Anyone)'':%0aTravis has an addictive personality and everyone knows it. It's expected that he'll die of an overdose or similar some day, or at least spend some time in rehab.%0a%0a!!!!%25red%25 ''Crossover and how i approach it'':%0aTo put it simply i love it and find it makes my play experience richer. I'll respect the wishes of anyone who prefers to avoid it, but that does not mean the consequences of your actions will be ignored if you engage with my character, their interests or those they would logically be involved with. No cop-outs; this is a crossover setting and it's unavoidable.
