A serious-faced fellow, a bit chilly in his expression and interactions, coming across as distant yet not trying to be distant, just naturally that way. While he is wont to smile it always seems mild, sincere, but not committed. His dark blond hair is currently cropped short-ish and he has taken to growing a mustache. John is not bulky, but he has the lean muscle of a sincere athletic bend; in good shape, the sort of someone who maintains it by doing physical work. John’s accent is standard American but peppered with occasional Appalachian sounds – such as the way he says lawyer, though this is fairly minimally noticeable.%0a%0aHe dresses in modest fashion, comfortable light sweaters (even in the summertime), scuffed up dress shoes, slacks, sometimes worn-out jeans - the type which have made it to this status via actual work. Aside from a wrist watch he can be found with no type of adornment or jewelry. He looks like he could be important, but not too important.

From a near distance it looks like an intricate and lengthy tattoo, but closer inspection reveals the imbedded barbed wire as just that, buried just beneath the surface. His skin color, silver... cold... is not misleading. It holds little warmth, often none - John is cold to touch.%0a%0aMantle? What mantle? Some mistake John as Courtless. Even so, a chill like cold steel cuts the skin, goose-prickling those nearby, especially when a contract is invoked.

His skin color, silver… cold… is not misleading. It holds little warmth, often none – John is cold to touch.%0a%3c %0a%3c Mantle? What mantle? Some mistake John as Courtless. Even so, a chill like cold steel cuts the skin, goose-prickling those nearby, especially when a contract is invoked. The stronger the invocation, the sharper and colder the bite.%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c (:div2end:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:table table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 bgcolor=#0d0d0d:)%0a%3c (:cell width=400:)%25newwin%25[[https://i.imgur.com/cz69au8.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/cz69au8.jpg]]%25%25%0a%3c (:cell width=400:)%25newwin%25[[https://i.imgur.com/pBRKGex.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/pBRKGex.jpg]]%25%25%0a%3c (:cell width=280:)%25newwin%25[[https://i.imgur.com/YsNHBCa.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/YsNHBCa.jpg]]%25%25%0a%3c (:tableend:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:table table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 bgcolor=#0d0d0d:)%0a%3c (:cell width=360:)%25newwin%25[[https://i.imgur.com/VYOpmF8.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/VYOpmF8.jpg]]%25%25%0a%3c (:cell width=390:)%25newwin%25[[https://i.imgur.com/70lN1I2.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/70lN1I2.jpg]]%25%25%0a%3c (:cell width=330:)%25newwin%25[[https://i.imgur.com/OI7eU3U.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/OI7eU3U.jpg]]%25%25%0a%3c (:tableend:)%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''Contacts'''%0a%3c %0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c %0a%3c (:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''Hooks'''%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat width=330px%25https://i.imgur.com/skITOuf.jpg%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''Tis But a Flesh Wound (Everyone)'': %0a%3c John is involved in the local Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA) community and, in general, combat-y oriented folks around Miami.

Some time in shelters, some on the street, he has maintained contact with the community in Miami and has a strong feeling of solidarity with those in crisis.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''The Support Beam (Everyone)'': %0a%3c John works at Alonso Machine Shop & Welding. The crew works on anything from columns to cat-walks, wall steel supports to decks. John crafts metal for just about any gig. He's helped put up buildings owned by the Tuttles and he's worked around the docks. If there was welding and metal involved, John was perhaps there.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''Sword of Ice (Changelings)'': %0a%3c John is in good standing with the Lost of Summer.
