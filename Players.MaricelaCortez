A few inches over five feet tall on a good day if she is not slouching. There is something about her that stands out, striking blue eyes, that look like they are piercing right through you. Expressive not just in her eyes, but in her facial features and body movements. Maricela generally can be found wearing jeans, tees and tank tops. Or even some coveralls. And if she has been tinkering around with an engine or some sort of machinery, it's likely she is dirty and covered in dirt, dust, oil, grease and the like. Her voice has a warm richness to it, as well as a slight accent to it, that marks her as having grown up with English as a second language, and her Latina heritage. %0a%0a|| %25color=#822EB0%25Height:||5'3"|| %25color=#822EB0%25Weight:||105lbs|| %25color=#822EB0%25Complexion:||Light Olive|| %25color=#822EB0%25Hair Color:||Changes Often||%0a|| %25color=#822EB0%25Eye Color:||Hazel|| %25color=#822EB0%25Date of Birth:||9/4/1991|| %25color=#822EB0%25Place of Birth:||SoCal|| %25color=#822EB0%25Accent:||Latin American Spanish||%0a|| %25color=#822EB0%25Build Type:||Skinny || %25color=#822EB0%25Birthmark:||Side Of Her Upper Left Thigh|| %25color=#822EB0%25Tattoos:||Several|| %25color=#822EB0%25Piercings:||Several||%0a%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/ZZtEfUz.png%0a%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a%0a!!!!%25color=#822EB0%25 ''Biker and Mechanic (Anyone)''%0aMaricela has recently moved here and made Portland her new home, taking up shop in a place out off out SE Foster, in SE Portland. The place is a bit rundown, but it serves its purpose, there is a large warehouse, that serves as a shop. With some excess property for storing cars, bikes, whatever. And a small craftsman house, that looks like it has definitely seen some better days. But if you are in end of your car or bike being fixed or upgraded, feel free to stop on by.%0a%0a!!!!%25color=#822EB0%25 ''MMA (Anyone)''%0aWhen she's not working on machinery, she can be found working out in the large warehouse, having turned half of it into a gym. Even with it's own practice ring for Martial Arts, along with the other usual items one might find in a gym; boxing bag, weights, and the like.%0a%0a!!!!%25color=#822EB0%25 ''The Blood of Kamdius-Ur (Werewolves)''%0aDeath is merely a part of life, is it not, a part of the circle, though ghosts, seem to exist outside it, for Maricela, this not exactly a problem, having learned at a young age, that those born with her heritage are able to stop them and trap them. On top of this ability, she has learned a decent amount on ghosts over the years as well.%0a%0a!!!!%25color=#822EB0%25 ''A Gifted Wolfblood (Werewolves)'': %0aNot only has she been graced at her birth, but she is an incredibly gifted Wolfblood, from her ability to see into Twilight, to her strangely long and spindly fingers that seem to help her with rites, to the fact that bruises don't last too long, to several other boons.

A few inches over five feet tall on a good day if she is not slouching. There is something about her that stands out, striking blue eyes, that look like they are piercing right through you. Expressive not just in her eyes, but in her facial features and body movements. Maricela generally can be found wearing jeans, tees and tank tops. Or even some coveralls. And if she has been tinkering around with an engine or some sort of machinery, it's likely she is dirty and covered in dirt, dust, oil, grease and the like. Her voice has a warm richness to it, as well as a slight accent to it, that marks her as having grown up with English as a second language, and her Latina heritage. %0a%3c %0a%3c (:div2end:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a%3c ----%0a%3c !!%25center%25%25werewolf%25'''Hooks'''%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25werewolf%25 ''Biker and Mechanic (Anyone)''%0a%3c Maricela has recently moved here and made Portland her new home, taking up shop in a place out off out SE Foster, in SE Portland. The place is a bit rundown, but it serves its purpose, there is a large warehouse, that serves as a shop. With some excess property for storing cars, bikes, whatever. And a small craftsman house, that looks like it has definitely seen some better days. But if you are in end of your car or bike being fixed or upgraded, feel free to stop on by.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25werewolf%25 ''MMA (Anyone)''%0a%3c When she's not working on machinery, she can be found working out in the large warehouse, having turned half of it into a gym. Even with it's own practice ring for Martial Arts, along with the other usual items one might find in a gym; boxing bag, weights, and the like.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25werewolf%25 ''The Blood of Kamdius-Ur (Werewolves)''%0a%3c Death is merely a part of life, is it not, a part of the circle, though ghosts, seem to exist outside it, for Maricela, this not exactly a problem, having learned at a young age, that those born with her heritage are able to stop them and trap them. On top of this ability, she has learned a decent amount on ghosts over the years as well.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25werewolf%25 ''A Gifted Wolfblood (Werewolves)'': %0a%3c Not only has she been graced at her birth, but she is an incredibly gifted Wolfblood, from her ability to see into Twilight, to her strangely long and spindly fingers that seem to help her with rites, to the fact that she is at times able to speak First Tongue, to several other boons. Though one she would likely tell you is more of a curse then a boon, especially when most people instantly see you and think you are evil. It gets tiring after a while.%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c (:div2end:)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25werewolf%25'''Contacts'''%0a%3c %0a%3c ||! %25werewolf%25Image ||! %25werewolf%25Name ||! %25werewolf%25Relationship ||! %25werewolf%25Comment ||! %25werewolf%25Ringtone ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/BC0eaKc.png || %25werewolf%25PC Name || %25werewolf%25Relationship to PC || %25werewolf%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25werewolf%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/BC0eaKc.png || %25werewolf%25PC Name || %25werewolf%25Relationship to PC || %25werewolf%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25werewolf%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/BC0eaKc.png || %25werewolf%25PC Name || %25werewolf%25Relationship to PC || %25werewolf%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25werewolf%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/BC0eaKc.png || %25werewolf%25PC Name || %25werewolf%25Relationship to PC || %25werewolf%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25werewolf%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/BC0eaKc.png || %25werewolf%25PC Name || %25werewolf%25Relationship to PC || %25werewolf%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25werewolf%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c (:div2end:)%0a%3c (:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:cellnr width=100%25:)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/3WM6cTl.png%0a%3c %0a%3c ||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/q2IagZz.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/q2IagZz.jpg]]||||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/LUYx1fo.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/LUYx1fo.jpg]]||||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/2UoN2F8.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/2UoN2F8.jpg]]||||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/ipBiT9y.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/ipBiT9y.jpg]]||||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/c1LxJeo.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/c1LxJeo.jpg]]||%0a%3c ||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/9HsgstR.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/9HsgstR.jpg]]||||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/OUmDCXH.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/OUmDCXH.jpg]]||||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/XKNGC5z.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/XKNGC5z.jpg]]||||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/OocChMj.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/OocChMj.jpg]]||||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/YfyalMs.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/YfyalMs.jpg]]||%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c (:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:cellnr width=100%25:)%0a%3c !!%25center%25%25werewolf%25'''Quotes'''%0a%3c %0a%3c %25mortal%25 "I am a quote!
