Burroughs''' - \\%0a\\%0a\\%0a\\%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a!!%25center%25%25vampire%25'''The Rules & The Rulers'''%25%25%0a%0a%25center%25Through us, you enter the society of liars and thieves. \\%0a%25center%25Through us, you enter the ranks of blood-drinkers with egos grown fat on getting away with murder. \\%0a%25center%25Through us, you enter the congress of corpses lacking the decency to lie still. \\%0a%25center%25What laws could we possibly respect? \\%0a%25center%25There are three rules even the dead fear to tread over. \\%0a%25center%25The Traditions. \\%0a%25center%25Recite them now until they skip right off the tip of your tongue.%25%25%0a%0aThree pillars bear the weight of a culture of monsters. There is no common origin story. No one remembers a time before them. Who first spoke the words? Some whisper the name “Camarilla,” but it hits the cold ear the way “Camelot” touches the warm. Some say the Traditions are written into the Blood, from the Beginning. They say these laws are mystically enforced. Others say the Traditions are so universal, so old, because they are simply common sense. It is good sense to hide from the herd; to not overpopulate the world with predators; to discourage one’s fellows from cannibalism. If the Traditions were mystically enforced, what need would there be for Princes to preside over them?%0a%0aThough throngs of treacherous monsters have come to a consensus on three great laws, opportunists and degenerates still break them. The Masquerade is trampled for love, for worship, or for a quick grip on temporal power. Passion and connivance bring violation of the Tradition of Progeny. True black-hearted evil brings the Kindred to commit the most heinous of transgressions: diablerie. But beneath these high crimes sit a whole host of petty offenses, all violations of one great commandment: Thou Shalt Not Get Caught. ''Lèse-majesté'', trespass, poaching, heresy, apostasy, conventional murder, and a hundred other infractions, real or imagined, are heard by the courts of the Kindred for the preservation of peace and order among the Damned. No great code of law or philosophy of justice governs the Kindred--it is all a matter of power and ''realpolitik''.%0a%0a-----------%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25vampire%25'''The Court'''%25%25%0a%0aThe court of Miami's Prince was once modeled after the ancient and venerable customs of the Kindred. Since the early 90’s, however, the court has taken a more modern form. The need for compromise gave rise to a governing Board of Directors, who oversee the common weal of the Miami Kindred on behalf of the Covenants and Clans that constitute the All Night Society. In polite deference, with various degrees of sincerity, the Board officially pays lip service to the idea that they are stewarding the city for the return of its rightful Prince, Cornell Mason. %0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Chairman of the Board''%0a%0aBy ancient custom the preeminent among the Damned is their Prince. In Miami, the Chairman of the Board carries out the ceremonial role of Prince and is sometimes even called such. ((For the purpose of administering the game and the stories we tell through it, this role will be filled by Non-Player Characters.))%0a%0a||! Name ||! Clan ||! Covenant  ||%0a|| [[Players.TyrusAlexander|Tyrus Alexander]] || Daeva ||  Carthian ||%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''The Board of Directors''%0a%0aEach Covenant and each Clan selects a Director to represent their constituency on a Board, by whatever means the Kindred belonging to that constituency determine. The Board, therefore, combines the traditional roles of Primogen and Prisci. Though the Chairman is presumed to act with the authority of Board, the Board's Resolutions are the mechanism for much of the All Night Society's governance.%0a%0a|| '''Invictus Director''' || [[Players.JoshuaBowen|Joshua Bowen]] || Gangrel || Invictus ||%0a|| '''Carthian Director''' || [[Players.AnnHerring|Ann Herring]] || Ventrue || Carthian Movement ||%0a|| '''Circle Director''' || [[Players.EdgarManson|Edgar Manson]] || Mekhet || Circle of the Crone ||%0a|| '''Lancea Director''' || [[Players.JoseCalderon|Jose Calderon]] || Ventrue || Lancea et Sanctum ||%0a|| '''Ordo Director''' || [[Players.AbrahamSachs|Abraham Sachs]] || Daeva || Ordo Dracul ||%0a|| '''Nosferatu Director''' || [[Players.WellingtonPHowell|Wellington P.

The Vice-Chairman is roughly analogous to the traditional courtly role of Seneschal, serving as a second-in-command who steps into the Chairman's position when circumstances require. The Secretary is responsible for keeping notes, setting the agenda, and presenting the minutes of Board Meetings for approval. The Treasurer looks after the resources of the Kindred of Miami. Though largely ceremonial, the Treasurer will from time to time present reports on boons, censuses of the Kindred population, divisions of domain, and such other matters as may be required.\\%0a\\%0a%0a|| '''Vice-Chairman of the Board''' || [[Players.JoshuaBowen|Joshua Bowen]] ||%0a|| '''Board Secretary''' || [[Players.Emily Powell|Emily Powell]] ||%0a|| '''Board Treasurer''' || [[Players.AnnHerring|Ann Herring]] ||%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Committees''%0a%0aCalling together the elder Damned, gathering a quorum, and getting them to vote on an issue is not always a simple task. The whole Board rarely meets outside of their scheduled meetings. To ensure the smooth running of the All Night Society, various Board Members are divided into committees which handle things under their purview. In addition to the voting Board Members, the committees may also select Advisory Committee Members to help them make their determinations.\\%0a\\%0aThe Committee on the Masquerade, the Embrace, and the Amaranth each correspond to one of the Traditions. Each Committee is responsible for considering novel issues that fall under the purview of their Tradition and making policy recommendations to better uphold the Traditions. These three committees are the most prestigious and any given Director will usually have a place on one of these committees. However, the Committee on the Amaranth is widely acknowledged as the least important, and being assigned to it is understood to be something of a snub--the crime of diablerie and its prosecution is considered cut-and-dried, and is not a matter that requires much philosophizing or debate. The Committee on Outsiders deals with city-wide policy regarding werewolves, the Lost, and other strange communities. The Committee on Tenure considers matter of territory and regency--they do not have the power to enact changes, but changes generally run through them for consideration and deliberation before being ratified by the Board and formally decreed by the Chairman.\\%0a\\%0a'''The Committee on the Masquerade''': [[Players.JoshuaBowen|Joshua Bowen]], [[Players.PhillipLombardo|Phillip Lombardo]], [[Players.AbrahamSachs|Abraham Sachs]]\\%0a'''The Committee on the Embrace''': [[Players.JoseCalderon|Jose Calderon]], [[Players.AnnHerring|Ann Herring]], (Member Vacancy)\\%0a'''The Committee on the Amaranth''': [[Players.EdgarManson|Edgar Manson]], [[Players.LevBronstein|Lev Bronstein]], [[Players.EmilyPowell|Emily Powell]]\\%0a'''The Committee on Outsiders''': [[Players.AbrahamSachs|Abraham Sachs]], [[Players.EdgarManson|Edgar Manson]], [[Players.JoshuaBowen|Joshua Bowen]]\\%0a'''The Committee on Tenure''': [[Players.PhillipLombardo|Phillip Lombardo]], [[Players.AnnHerring|Ann Herring]], [[Players.JoseCalderon|Jose Calderon]]\\%0a%0a-----------%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Executive Officers''%0a%0aThe deliberative and formal nature of the Board leaves the Board slow to act. To prevent this structure from stymieing the city's response to crisis, the Board has established certain Executive Officer roles. The City's Officers act with full authority in their capacity, but the Board selects officers and defines that capacity according to the Board's own wisdom. %0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Chief Security Officer''%0a%0aThe CSO is Miami's name for the traditional role of Sheriff. The CSO enforces the law over a given domain. This includes but is not limited to investigating, interrogating, and determining which laws have been broken. The CSO also determines whether to bring the criminal before the Board. The CSO is the first person that should be notified when the Masquerade is breached. The CSO assigns Security Assistants in order to help him or her in keeping the peace and maintaining order.%0a%0a*'''Investigation, and Social skills are suggested'''%0a%0a||! Name ||! Clan ||!

The role is little changed from that observed in most Kindred domains, consisting of the usual official and unofficial duties. Unofficially PR Execs represent a who’s who of Kindred affairs. Other Kindred look to them to see who’s in and who’s out, and what positions and opinions are popular this season. A well regarded PR Exec can sway public opinion faster with a biting comment than even the Chairman can with a solid decree. Officially, the duty of Public Relations Exec is to keep track of boons and make rulings when boon payment is contested.%0a%0a*'''Good Social and Political skills, active in the venue and good at paper keeping(For Boons)'''%0a%0a||!

He may, at any time, assign people to new positions or revoke the position for those already in it. The exception is the Board, who are assigned their position by the rules and decisions of their own Covenant and Clan. In addition, each covenant may submit their choice for Public Relations Executive, though official appointment to the position is made by the Chairman or, if he declines to rule, the Board. The Chief Security Officer may assign a reasonable number of deputy Security Assistants. These deputies act with the office of the Sheriff behind them. The Chief Security Officer is responsible for their actions as Security Assistants.''%0a*'''Territory'''%0a**''The domain of the Chairman is, by right of rank, the whole of the city and its districts. The divisions of territory is to be determined by right of control, though the Chairman retains the right to give and revoke territories at his discretion. The respective governing kindred of each Covenant may establish their own laws and statutes within their territory, as long as such laws do not contravene the articles of this document, nor affect the affairs of other Covenants. Each Kindred’s personal Haven shall be considered their inviolate personal domain. This personal domain may only be violated by the decree of a Blood Hunt, abandonment, or by the office of Chief Security Officer acting upon a reasonable suspicion of wrong doing. Right of passage of Kindred to Elysium, to any Court, and the Embassy is guaranteed and can only be revoked by the Chairman or a unanimous vote of the Board.''%0a*'''Elysium'''%0a**''Elysium’s ground is sacred and shall not be violated by violence or aggressive acts.

Appeal may be made to the Board, which may deny hearing the appeal. Those who refuse to pay their lawfully recognized debts, shall have all debts owed to them declared null and void. Furthermore, they shall be stripped of Citizenship and all protection under the law. This decision shall be made by the Public Relations Executives collectively and both the accused and the accuser may appeal the decision to the Board.''%0a*'''Justice & Punishment'''%0a**''It is the duty of all Kindred to report any crimes or violations of the law. Harboring or assisting a fugitive from the Court’s justice is a violation of the law.''%0a*'''Amendments, Decrees, Precedent'''%0a**''The Chairman is empowered to issue Decrees as needed to administer, defend, and protect the city.

The Prince's mantle went unclaimed because no single Kindred could marshal enough power to claim Praxis alone. As the chaos wore on, the battered partisans drew up a truce to preserve what remained of their society. The Covenants demurred to any one claim, and instead determined that a Board of Directors would govern the Kindred. No Prince would rule from any throne.

In the absence of Prince Mason, his Seneschal, Joshua Bowen, has wielded the true power behind the Board--and Joshua Bowen has always been loyal to Mason.

The Kindred of Miami have seen the consequences of standing on the wrong side of political lines, and no one is willing to risk being on the losing end of the wars of decades past.

Bowen's reliance on hard leverage and direct control has been effective but it continues to create new enemies. Bowen’s predilections and mannerisms have proven to be … problematic to traditionalists within the covenant. Bowen is vulgar, lacking the class and sophistication that most Invictus rely on to maintain their Requiems, their Masquerades, and their Humanity.

The Covenants demurred to any one claim, and instead determined that a Board of Directors would govern the Kindred. No Prince would rule from any throne.
