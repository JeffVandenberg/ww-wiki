A deceptively demure young woman,  she is often dressed in plain, simple clothing. Nothing with logos on it or that shows too much skin. Such things are far too detracting.  She could be considered pretty, beautiful even, if she didn't continually try to downplay it. %0a!!!!%25center%25%25vampire%25''Bloodless''%0a%25center%25Everything about the woman feels faded. She's a wisp of a thing that looks like she might break if handled too roughly. Don't let the frail look fool you though, her beast stirs close and occasionally the look in her eyes seems to portray that she's begging for a fight.%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25vampire%25'''Personality'''%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=0px width=330  margin-right=10px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=0px newwin%25 https://i.imgur.com/kuBDxhf.jpg%0a%0a%25center%25Most people would consider Gracie to be soft spoken, idealistic, and maybe even a bit too naive. This is precisely how she likes it.  She is friendly and will generally talk to everyone and anyone, but there's something a little unsettling about that wild look in her eyes. Like a beast that's caged, pacing, ready to pounce the moment it's let loose. %0a%0aShe'll strike up pleasant conversation and gains the trust of those she helps in her volunteer counselor position because, oh she's been there too and she //wants// to see you succeed.  Most people won't even realize they've fallen off their wagons until it's too late and even fewer will believe that she's pulled all the strings.%0a%0aWhen she's helping during sermons, Gracie comes alive. It's the Lord's doing, obviously. She does snake handling with ease and speaks in tongues on occasion. She wants to help all those who are lost and down trodden to see the light as it was shown to her. Everyone deserves a chance at redemption.
