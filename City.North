The Produce Market, the largest open-air food distribution center in Miami, serves local supermarkets and bodegas with the freshest variety of South Florida produce, tropical fruits and many other products.%0a%0aThe industrial district of the city of Miami is located in an area straddling the Civic Center and Allapattah, along a former FEC corridor just north of Northwest 20th Street. Trades ranging from clothing manufacturers, auto repair, carpentry and upholstery shops. Additionally, several shipyards and dry docks located along the neighborhood's banks of the Miami River.%0a%0aThe Acadia subdivision was platted in 1915 by the Realty Securities Corporation and George E. Merrick. Although the subdivision evokes the memory of Longfellow with such names as Acadian Way, Evangeline Circle, Tropical Trail, and Druid Walk, the houses developed here are distinctly Mediterranean Revival in influence. This is due perhaps to the fact that only two houses were constructed prior to 1925. Development took off during the Boom years of the mid-1920s, however, when Wykoff and Estes Builders constructed an outstanding cluster of large, two-story Mediterranean Revival style houses near the eastern end of NE 70th Street.%0a%0aThe last subdivision to be subdivided was Washington Place, which was also developed between 1925 and the mid-1940s. Samuel J. Prescott, who platted the subdivision in 1925, had constructed his own winter home at 7101 N.E. 10th Avenue some years before. The house remains today as one of the last intact bayfront estates in Northeast Miami. The estate once featured a recreational golf course for residents and guests. Prescott was the founder of the firm of Samuel J. Prescott Co., Inc., building contractors, which developed several significant buildings in downtown Washington, D.C. Prescott was chairman of the board of the Second National Bank of Washington, D.C., president of the Master Builders Association, the Builders and Manufacturers Exchange, and the Prescott Farms Company of New Hampshire.%0a%0aBuena Vista, Lemon City, and Little River were founded before the turn of the 19th-century and represent some of the earliest settlements in Miami-Dade County. The area known as Buena Vista was once a small village adjoining, but not within the corporate limits of Miami proper. Although preceded in age by pioneer Lemon City, a town located a little further north, the small village of Buena Vista dates its birth, development, and growth along with Miami's. The founding of Buena Vista dates back to the days when the immense rock ridge extending between the Atlantic Ocean and the Florida Everglades was covered by a dense pine forest. The earliest history of the village is recorded in a survey made by government surveyors, and the locations of the land tracts are to this date still founded on this early document.%0a%0aThe land which became Buena Vista was originally part of the homesteads of William Henry Gleason and E.L. White. Gleason, a prominent and somewhat notorious figure in early Miami-Dade County politics, arrived in Miami after the Civil War was elected Lieutenant Governor of Florida. He left the area in 1876 but retained his homestead for several years, eventually turning it over to his son. As early as 1892, E.L. White homesteaded the area from North 41st Street to 54th Street between West 2nd Avenue and East 2nd Avenue. This was the area from which the Biltmore and Shadowlawn Subdivisions, which today make up the "Buena Vista East Historic District", were carved in the early 1920s.%0a%0aThe arrival of the railroad in 1896 marked the end of an era for the pioneer bayfront village of Lemon City, which had enjoyed tremendous importance to the Miami area by virtue of its docks. Now the train brought much needed supplies to the rest of Dade County, and lured people away from the bayfront community to Miami and its outlying areas. The Lemon City depot, built in 1896, drew business further west away from the bay, and the small village of Buena Vista gradually developed. One of the earliest subdivisions in the Buena Vista areas was the Buena Vista Biscayne Badger Club Subdivision, which was developed in 1910 as a bayfront community with a private water plant, streets, and a park with recreation dock on the bay. However, it was inland where the village took shape. By 1910, suburban Buena Vista could boast of one hotel known as the Courley House, its very own railroad depot on the Florida East Coast Railway line, a small post office building, tropical fruit groves, a fruit-packing house, a grocery store, and one religious institution, the Holy Cross Episcopal Church.%0a%0a%0aIn the decades that followed its incorporation, growth was steady. A variety of architectural styles were introduced, yet the community emerged as the type of development the Shoreland Company envisioned. The community retains many of its original characteristics well situated and serviced by major highways, having tree-lined streets and wide roads, a downtown area, well-maintained homes provided with efficient services. and a variety of community activities.%0a%0aAs Miami's population expanded during the late 1920s and early 1920s, new subdivisions reached northward along Biscayne Bay. In 1922, a large, undeveloped bayfront tract near the northern city limits was platted. Called Bay Shore, this area was subdivided by the Bay Shore Investment Company and was the first of three phases that would be developed by the company between 1922 and 1924.Houses constructed in the Morningside Historic District reflect the eclecticism popular in the early twentieth century. The earlier buildings in the district are predominantly Mediterranean Revival in style, while structures built in the 1930s and early 1940s are frequently Art Deco. Outstanding examples of both styles are found here. Morningside also features a large number of masonry vernacular buildings that frequently utilize elements of several styles. An unusual Tudor Revival style house and one of the City's best examples of Mission style architecture add to the area's architectural diversity.%0a%0a[[#to]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Allapattah''%25%25%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/B3166ls.jpg%0aAllapattah is a neighborhood mostly in the city of Miami, Florida, and partly in metropolitan Miami, United States. As of May 2011, the county-owned portion of Allapattah, from State Road 9 to LeJeune Road, is being annexed by the city proper.%0a%0aA stretch in the neighborhood along NW 17th Avenue was nicknamed Little Santo Domingo in 2003, in an effort spurred by former Miami mayor and longtime city commissioner Wilfredo "Willy" Gort to honor the sizable Dominican American population in the community%0a%0aThe name is derived from the Seminole Indian language word meaning alligator. The initial settlement of the Allapattah community began in 1856 when William P. Wagner, the earliest documented white American permanent settler, arrived from Charleston, South Carolina and established a homestead on a hammock along the Miami Rock Ridge, where Miami Jackson High School presently stands. Development ensued from 1896 and into the 20th century in the area with the completion of the Florida East Coast Railroad (FEC).%0a%0aAllapattah was predominantly populated by whites from early in the 20th century until the late 1950s, when there was a large influx of black Americans displaced by the construction of I-95 (then, the North-South Expressway) in the 1950s and 1960s, leading to white flight to suburban Miami-Dade County and Broward County. Cubans migrated to Miami neighborhoods like Allapattah in large numbers following the Cuban Revolution of 1959, hosting one of Miami's largest Cuban American populations. The 1980s brought influxes of Dominican Americans, Nicaraguans, Hondurans, and Haitians in the aftermath of various refugee crises in those nations. Now, a melting pot of residents from all across the Caribbean, Central America, and Latin America reside in the area.%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' ••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Bay Point''%25%25%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/g1Ruj0O.jpg%0aThe Bayside Historic District reflects the formative years of the early 1900s through the mid-1940s. Once a part of the pioneer settlement of Lemon City, Bayside contains the oldest intact community in Northeast Miami, as well as one of this area's last remaining bayfront estates. From its onset, Bayside was the home of many prominent residents who played significant roles in the business life of both Lemon City and Miami.%0a%0aBayside has four distinct subdivisions which were platted between 1909 and 1925, although the area itself was first settled in the late nineteenth century. These subdivisions include Elmira (N.E. 68th Street and N.E. 67th Street), which was platted in 1909; Acadia (N.E. 70th Street), which was platted in 1915; Baywood (N.E. 69th Street and the south side of N.E. 71st Street), which was platted in 1921 and added to in 1924; and Washington Place (N.E. 72nd Street and the north side of N.E. 71st Street), which was platted in 1925.%0a%0aIn 1909, William B. and Fred C. Miller (not related) subdivided a seven-acre bayfront lot on today's N.E. 68th Street. The Millers had come to Florida in the late 1880s from Elmira, New York and had developed Elmira Farms near Arch Creek. Their new subdivision was named Elmira, and oolitic limestone gates announced the entrance to the new community.%0a%0aWhile much of what was Lemon City has been engulfed by later developments, Elmira has remained virtually intact. Although many of its houses have deteriorated, and newer buildings have been added, the street retains much of its early character. Elmira is characterized by its excellent collection of Frame Vernacular buildings, many of which were inspired by Northern architectural styles. The Elmira Club at 742 N.E. 68th Street, for example, has Dutch Colonial Revival influences, while other houses display classical details.

During the Land Boom of the 1920s, the area was developed as the Biltmore and Shadowlawn subdivisions. Originally home to many Florida cracker immigrants from Georgia and North Carolina, the neighborhood soon became popular with the owners of nearby businesses. The houses reflect their original owners' rising social status and include fine examples of Mediterranean Revival, Mission, Craftsman, and Art Deco architecture style residences.%0a%0aOther prominent citizens acquired land in Buena Vista. Among them was the millionaire, Charles Deering, who purchased a large tract of bayfront land east of the railroad, in the area now known as the Upper Eastside. This land is where the "Baypoint" neighborhood is now located. Much of the area fronting the bay was naturally wooded, and here Deering created an arboretum and sanctuary for birds and animals. There were no public roadways in the area east of the railroad, and since Deering strongly opposed the opening of such streets, the area was preserved in its pristine, virgin state for many years.%0a%0aAs the population of Miami grew between the late 1910s through the Boom era of the early 1920s, new areas reached northward along the old Dixie Highway (N.E. 2nd Avenue) and Avenue D (N. Miami Avenue), which was extended northward from N.E. 36th Street. The northern city limit of Miami was moved to N.E. 38th Street, and this took in a part of Buena Vista. Finally, on August 4, 1924, the new town of Buena Vista was incorporated and, together with the other incorporated areas of Coconut Grove and Silver Bluff, was annexed to the City of Miami the following year.%0a%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' ••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Buena Vista East Historic District%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Design District''%25%25%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/kg6vNN7.jpg%0aThe Miami Design District is a neighborhood in Miami, Florida, United States and a shopping, dining and cultural destination.

Several people settled near Biscayne Bay north of the Miami River after the civil war, squatting on unclaimed land. Some of the squatters eventually applied for homestead grants for the land they were squatting on. By 1889 a community had formed, with a post office named "Motto". "Lemon City" replaced "Motto" as the name of the community by 1893. A school had opened in 1890, and Lemon City also included several businesses and a newspaper, as well as port facilities on Biscayne Bay. With the extension of the Florida East Coast Railway to Miami in 1896, Miami quickly overshadowed Lemon City.%0a%0a%0aPortrait of Father Grard Jean-Juste on a gable wall by Serge Toussaint in Little Haiti.%0aViter Juste, a noted Haitian businessman, activist and respected community leader, came up with the name of Little Haiti. According to Jean-Claude Exulien, a retired professor of history and friend of Juste's since 1977, Juste wrote an article in the Miami Herald in which he first referred to the neighborhood as "Little Port-au-Prince." However, editors at the Miami Herald found the name, "Little Port-au-Prince," too long, so the newspaper shortened the term in the headline to Little Haiti. Over the objections of historians and African-Americans, Miami commissioners in May 2016 voted in favor of designating Little Haiti as an official neighborhood with boundaries overlapping the historic Lemon City, which was founded by Bahamian immigrants before Miami existed.%0a%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' • to ••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Little Haiti&#65533;s main strip%0a*The Little Haiti Community Garden%0a*Athalie Range Park%0a*Caribbean Marketplace%0a%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Liberty City''%25%25%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/fvHh9L2.jpg%0aOnce a part of the sparsely populated outskirts of northern Miami, what became Liberty City developed during the Great Depression of the 1930s when President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized the construction of the Liberty Square housing project in 1933, the first of its kind in the Southern United States. Built as a response to the deteriorating housing conditions in densely populated and covenant-restricted slums of Overtown, construction on the initial housing project began in 1934 and opened in 1937.%0a%0aInto the 1940s and 1950s, the growing Liberty City and adjacent Brownsville thrived as a middle income black American community, hosting several churches, hospitals, and community centers. The area served as home to prominent figures such as Kelsey Pharr, M. Athalie Range (the first black American elected to serve on the Miami city commission) and boxer Muhammad Ali. Although segregation laws prohibited black Americans from resting and residing in popular Miami Beach, service establishment and resorts such as the Hampton House Motel and Villas catered to and entertained the likes of notables such as Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Althea Gibson, and even whites such as Mickey Mantle.%0a%0aConstruction of Interstate 95 in Florida in Overtown and declining use of restrictive covenants in the wake of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 dramatically altered the neighborhood into the 1960s. Increasing numbers of lower income elderly and welfare-dependent families migrated to the Liberty City neighborhood following their displacement primarily from inner city Overtown, leading to large-scale black flight of middle and higher income blacks and other blacks like West Indian Americans largely to suburban areas like Florida City and Miami Gardens in southern and northern Dade County, respectively.%0a%0aCrime grew prevalent in the increasingly poverty-stricken area in the immediate post&#65533;civil rights movement era of the 1960s and 1970s. The ensuing problems of the poor and disenfranchised grew most apparent and notable in race riots which occurred in Liberty City in August 1968 during the Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, and in 1980 following the acquittal of police officers charged with the killing of Arthur McDuffie.%0a%0aThe plight of inner-city black Miamians increasingly came to be highlighted in national press into the 1980s as the Hurricanes football team of the University of Miami won several national college football championships led by players recruited from the mostly black, lower income neighborhoods such as Liberty City and Overtown. National exposure continued with the popularity of nationally broadcast programs such as the NBC crime drama Miami Vice, which brought the deteriorating conditions of the area to greater prominence.%0a%0aInto the 1990s and 2000s, the music grew to reflect the area with locals such as Luther Campbell of 2 Live Crew pioneering the Miami bass genre which dominated Southern hip hop music during the decade. Other music and sports talents rose to national prominence from the area such as rappers Trina and Trick Daddy and NFL players Chad "Ocho Cinco" Johnson, and Willis McGahee.%0a%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' • to ••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*%25vampire%25[[HM-95 Nike Missile Base ]]%25%25%0a*Miami Dade College%0a*Model City Library%0a*Sandrell Rivers Theater%0a*Charles Hardley Park%0a%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Little River''%25%25%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/hRrOy9I.jpg%0aLittle River is a neighborhood in Miami, Florida.

These were the various enterprises in which the early pioneers were engaged and with the coming of the railroad and its stop at the Biscayne Station, they were able to live off the land. Two of the most successful growers were Major Hugh Gordon and T.V. Moore. T.V. Moore owned the land in what is today's commercial district, while the Gordon Tract bordered the bay. By 1922, Lee T. Cooper, who had amassed his wealth from a patent medicine by the name of Tanlac, purchased T.V. Moore's land holdings. Cooper planned to develop the area and named it Bay View Estates. In 1924, the Shoreland Company purchased the Gordon Tract, Bay View Estates and other scattered acreage in order to create Miami Shores, "America's Mediterranean."%0a%0aHugh M. Anderson, president of the Shoreland Company, and its board of directors were experienced real estate developers. They previously completed the successful development of the Venetian Islands and they decided that their new project would be similar residences of Italian inspired architecture within a landscape associated with water. The master development plan for Greater Miami Shores included 9,000 building sites, 5 2/3 miles of bay frontage, four miles of inland waterways and ten miles of main roadways. The plans also called for the construction of a causeway to Miami Beach, a golf course, a country club, a yacht club, a business district, apartment buildings, hotels, a school and churches, a railroad station and beautifying features such as parks, plazas and entryways.%0a%0aEarly in 1926, it was reported that approximately 50 homes had been completed, another 50 were under construction, and an additional 100 were being planned. The commercial building program was in progress, sidewalks and roadways were being laid out and lighting and landscape work was well underway. Record setting sales and resales of property were being recorded. Unfortunately, on September 18, 1926, all plans for the community came to a halt with the arrival of a devastating hurricane. In addition, other factors contributed to the Shoreland Company's bankruptcy in 1927.%0a%0aThe present Miami Shores roughly corresponds with the original "Biscayne" neighborhood of the City of Miami. With the arrival of the Great Depression, the City of Miami gave up its jurisdiction and the area incorporated under the name Miami Shores Village in 1932. Previously, part of the area that now comprises the City of North Miami had been known as Miami Shores. Under the leadership of Roy H. Hawkins, a request to grant a charter creating Miami Shores Village was presented in the State Legislature. On January 2, 1932, the Village became official at a council meeting. The charter named the following five members to the first council: Hugh H. Gordon, a banker whose father had owned the Gordon Tract; Frank O. Pruitt, who was in the insurance business; John M. Carlisle, president of the Eli Witt Cigar Company; W.F. Andes, a prominent dentist; and M.R. Harrison, a general contractor, who constructed much of Biscayne Boulevard. At this first meeting, Pruitt was elected mayor, and other appointments were made including Village Manager Miller Williams, Village Attorney George E. Holt, and a single policeman, Ed Badger.%0a%0aToday, Miami Shores is primarily a bedroom community for those working in Greater Miami, and has a sizeable retired population. The village is mostly single family residential homes, with very few multi-family units and only two small commercial areas along Northeast 2nd Avenue and Biscayne Boulevard.%0a%0aWhile it is frequently referred to as Miami Shores or the Village of Miami Shores, the municipality's official name under its charter is Miami Shores Village.%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a%0a%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' •••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Barry's University%0a*Brockway Memorial Library%0a*Miami Shores Country Club%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Midtown''%25%25%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/kfCkR79.jpg%0aMidtown Miami is the collective term for the Wynwood and Edgewater neighborhoods of Miami, Florida, United States, north of Downtown and south of the Miami Design District. It is roughly bound by North 20th Street to the south, I-195 to the north, I-95 to the west and Biscayne Bay to the east.%0a%0aIn 2005, construction began on the "Midtown Miami" development between North 29th and 36th Street and Miami Avenue and the Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) on what was historically an FEC rail yard. The project is a large-scale, urban development that was planned with 8 high-rise residential buildings, a hotel, two parks, and a major urban shopping area, "The Shops at Midtown". Due to the collapse of the real estate bubble in 2007, only two residential buildings, and about 2/3 of "The Shops at Midtown" were built. In July 2011, plans were announced to begin construction on a new entertainment center at Midtown, including a hotel, and shops on the site of the current temporary park in the center of Midtown. Critics of Midtown state the lack of parks as a major issue.%0a%0aMidtown has grown quickly, and is home to Shops at Midtown, an outdoor shopping area designed to mimic New York's SOHO neighborhood, and home to many national and local stores and restaurants including Target, Guess, HomeGoods, Marshalls, Sakaya Kitchen, Baru Urbano, Novecento & IT Lounge, Riviera Focacceria Italiana, Giraffas Brazilian Grill, Spris, Bar Louie, Wine Vault, 100 Montaditos, World of Beer, Chef Leon, Mercado Latino, My Ceviche, Five Guys Burgers & Fries, 4D Gelateria, Hurricane Grill & Wings, Lime Fresh Mexican Grill, Spun Candy, Pinkberry, SugarCane, Mercadito, Lagniappe, Sustain, Cheese Course, Buro Miami, Ring Finger Studio, and an abundance of upscale apartments. A fair amount of office businesses have also taken up residence in Midtown in office buildings, in industries ranging from interior decor to marketing agency services, and more. At B&#65533;ro Urbano urban workspace, office spaces are provided for small businesses. Midtown has also become home to Art Miami art fair, which takes place during Miami's Art Basel week.%0a%0aOn 1 August 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a travel warning, advising pregnant women not to visit Midtown Miami, the Design District and Wynwood areas to avoid getting the Zika virus. Zika warnings in Miami have been lifted by the end of 2016%0a%0aBacardi's United States headquarters were located in the Bacardi buildings also near Midtown Miami. By 2007 Bacardi USA agreed to lease a complex in Coral Gables to use as its new headquarters. At that time, Bacardi had employees in seven buildings across South Florida. Bacardi vacated its former headquarters buildings. Miami citizens began a campaign to label the buildings as historic. Allan T. Schulman, a professor of architecture at the University of Miami, said "Miami's brand is its identity as a tropical city. The Bacardi buildings are exactly the sort that resonate with our consciousness of what Miami is about."  In 2007 Chad Oppenheim, the head of Oppenheim Architecture + Design, described the Bacardi buildings as "elegant, with a Modernist [look combined with] a local flavor." In late 2012, the National YoungArts Foundation purchased the storied Bacardi buildings and converted them into their national headquarters%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' ••••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Morning Side''%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/hdUejRo.png%0aStarted in the 1920s as "Bay Shore," it prospered in the mid-20th century and fell on hard times along with most of Miami's other inner city neighborhoods in the 60's and 70's. More recently Morningside was the first historic area in central Miami to experience gentrification with an influx of more-affluent residents. It has now been fully restored. The Morningside Historic District runs from NE 55th Street to NE 60th Street; it was the first historic district to be designated as such in the City of Miami. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992 as the Bay Shore Historic District.%0a%0aThe Morningside Historic District is significant to the history of architecture, landscape architecture, and community development in Miami. Developed primarily between 1922 and 1941, Morningside contains a wealth of Mediterranean, Art Deco, and vernacular style houses that reflect the diversity and direction of architectural design during the 1920s and 1930s. Morningside is one of Miami's best planned subdivisions, featuring wide, tree-lined boulevards that contribute to the character of the area. This neighborhood was envisioned as an exclusive, residential community, and its amenities and location on Biscayne Bay attracted many influential and prominent local residents. One of Miami's most intact historic neighborhoods, Morningside is the City's best remaining example of a boom-era suburb.%0a%0aThe Morningside Historic District stands today as one of Miami's most intact historic neighborhoods. Despite the number of post-1941 buildings in the area, Morningside retains a high degree of historic and architectural integrity. This is due, in part, to the fact that most later buildings are not intrusive, but respect the earlier structures in scale, setback, materials, and workmanship.

Wynwood is best known for being a prominent entertainment district, dotted with artwork, restaurants, breweries, clothing stores, dance venues, among other retail options. Formerly an industrial district, the area is highlighted by colorful murals that cover the walls of many of the buildings. It is north of Downtown Miami and Overtown, and adjacent to Edgewater. Wynwood has two major sub-districts, the Wynwood Art District in northern Wynwood, and the Wynwood Fashion District along West 5th Avenue. Wynwood is roughly divided by North 20th Street to the south, I-195 to the north, I-95 to the west and the Florida East Coast Railway to the east.%0a%0aWynwood was long referred to as "Little San Juan", and commonly known as "El Barrio" as many Puerto Ricans began immigrating to this Miami neighborhood from the island and northeastern cities in the 1950s. Puerto Rican-owned restaurants, shops, markets and other businesses line the streets of Wynwood. Since the early 2000s, the neighborhood has seen a rising amount of investments and attention, expanding the scope of the region. The Midtown Miami development construction began in 2005 between North 29th and 36th Street and Miami Avenue and the Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) on what was historically an FEC rail yard. This brought renewed attention to the area, and previously abandoned warehouses have begun to be occupied by artists, restaurants, caf&#65533;s, and lounges. Tony Goldman, a developer, also assisted in the growth of Wynwood by creating a mecca out of the already present graffiti. In 2009, artists commissioned by Goldman helped create the Wynwood Walls. Located in the Wynwood Art District, this is an outdoor exhibition of rotating street art.%0aArt district%0aThe Wynwood Art District is a sub-district of Wynwood that contains galleries, outdoor murals and private art collections. The district is centered around Wynwood Walls, conceived of by the late urban developer Tony Goldman in 2009. His idea was to revitalize the neighborhood by turning warehouses into works of art. According to the Walls' website, artists featured at Wynwood Walls include: Shepard Fairey, Okuda San Miguel, The London Police, Stelios Faitakis, Clare Rojas, The Date Farmers, avaf, ROA, Ron English, Jeff Soto, Logan Hicks, b., PHASE 2, Joe Grillo, COCO 144, Gaia, Vhils, Interesni Kazki, Brandon Opalka, Friends With You, DALeast, Faith 47, Santiago Rubino, Daze, Maya Hayuk and Lakwena.

The initial settlement of the Allapattah community began in 1856 when William P. Wagner, the earliest documented white American permanent settler, arrived from Charleston, South Carolina and established a homestead on a hammock along the Miami Rock Ridge, where Miami Jackson High School presently stands. Development ensued from 1896 and into the 20th century in the area with the completion of the Florida East Coast Railroad (FEC).%0a> %0a> Allapattah was predominantly populated by whites from early in the 20th century until the late 1950s, when there was a large influx of black Americans displaced by the construction of I-95 (then, the North-South Expressway) in the 1950s and 1960s, leading to white flight to suburban Miami-Dade County and Broward County. Cubans migrated to Miami neighborhoods like Allapattah in large numbers following the Cuban Revolution of 1959, hosting one of Miami's largest Cuban American populations. The 1980s brought influxes of Dominican Americans, Nicaraguans, Hondurans, and Haitians in the aftermath of various refugee crises in those nations.

Once a part of the pioneer settlement of Lemon City, Bayside contains the oldest intact community in Northeast Miami, as well as one of this area's last remaining bayfront estates. From its onset, Bayside was the home of many prominent residents who played significant roles in the business life of both Lemon City and Miami.%0a> %0a> Bayside has four distinct subdivisions which were platted between 1909 and 1925, although the area itself was first settled in the late nineteenth century. These subdivisions include Elmira (N.E. 68th Street and N.E. 67th Street), which was platted in 1909; Acadia (N.E. 70th Street), which was platted in 1915; Baywood (N.E. 69th Street and the south side of N.E. 71st Street), which was platted in 1921 and added to in 1924; and Washington Place (N.E. 72nd Street and the north side of N.E. 71st Street), which was platted in 1925.%0a> %0a> In 1909, William B. and Fred C. Miller (not related) subdivided a seven-acre bayfront lot on today's N.E. 68th Street. The Millers had come to Florida in the late 1880s from Elmira, New York and had developed Elmira Farms near Arch Creek. Their new subdivision was named Elmira, and oolitic limestone gates announced the entrance to the new community.%0a> %0a> While much of what was Lemon City has been engulfed by later developments, Elmira has remained virtually intact. Although many of its houses have deteriorated, and newer buildings have been added, the street retains much of its early character. Elmira is characterized by its excellent collection of Frame Vernacular buildings, many of which were inspired by Northern architectural styles. The Elmira Club at 742 N.E. 68th Street, for example, has Dutch Colonial Revival influences, while other houses display classical details. The majority of houses were constructed in the 1910s.%0a> %0a21a64,94%0a> The last subdivision to be subdivided was Washington Place, which was also developed between 1925 and the mid-1940s. Samuel J. Prescott, who platted the subdivision in 1925, had constructed his own winter home at 7101 N.E. 10th Avenue some years before. The house remains today as one of the last intact bayfront estates in Northeast Miami. The estate once featured a recreational golf course for residents and guests. Prescott was founder of the firm of Samuel J. Prescott Co., Inc., building contractors, which developed several significant buildings in downtown Washington, D.C. Prescott was chairman of the board of the Second National Bank of Washington, D.C., president of the Master Builders Association, the Builders and Manufacturers Exchange, and the Prescott Farms Company of New Hampshire.%0a> %0a> The Bayside Historic District remains today as an intact, cohesive neighborhood. Despite the number of post-1941 buildings, Bayside retains a high level of historic and architectural integrity.%0a> Houses constructed in Bayside reflect the diversity, direction, and taste of individual residents as well as the architectural eclecticism prevalent in the early-20th century. The earlier buildings in the district are Frame Vernacular, with several examples of early bungalows. Houses built in the 1920s are generally Mediterranean Revival in style, while structures built in the 1930s and 1940s are frequently Art Deco.

Once a part of the pioneer settlement of Lemon City, Bayside contains the oldest intact community in Northeast Miami, as well as one of this area's last remaining bayfront estates. From its onset, Bayside was the home of many prominent residents who played significant roles in the business life of both Lemon City and Miami.%0a> %0a> Bayside has four distinct subdivisions which were plated between 1909 and 1925, although the area itself was first settled in the late nineteenth century. These subdivisions include Elmira (N.E. 68th Street and N.E. 67th Street), which was platted in 1909; Acadia (N.E. 70th Street), which was platted in 1915; Baywood (N.E. 69th Street and the south side of N.E. 71st Street), which was platted in 1921 and added to in 1924; and Washington Place (N.E. 72nd Street and the north side of N.E. 71st Street), which was platted in 1925.%0a> %0a> In 1909, William B. and Fred C. Miller (not related) subdivided a seven-acre bayfront lot on today's N.E. 68th Street. The Millers had come to Florida in the late 1880s from Elmira, New York and had developed Elmira Farms near Arch Creek. Their new subdivision was named Elmira, and oolitic limestone gates announced the entrance to the new community.%0a> %0a> While much of what was Lemon City has been engulfed by later developments, Elmira has remained virtually intact. Although many of its houses have deteriorated, and newer buildings have been added, the street retains much of its early character. Elmira is characterized by its excellent collection of Frame Vernacular buildings, many of which were inspired by Northern architectural styles. The Elmira Club at 742 N.E. 68th Street, for example, has Dutch Colonial Revival influences, while other houses display classical details. The majority of houses were constructed in the 1910s.%0a> %0a> The Acadia subdivision was platted in 1915 by the Realty Securities Corporation and George E. Merrick. Although the subdivision evokes the memory of Longfellow with such names as Acadian Way, Evangeline Circle, Tropical Trail, and Druid Walk, the houses developed here are distinctly Mediterranean Revival in influence. This is due perhaps to the fact that only two houses were constructed prior to 1925. Development took off during the Boom years of the mid-1920s, however, when Wykoff and Estes Builders constructed an outstanding cluster of large, two-story Mediterranean Revival style houses near the eastern end of NE 70th Street.%0a> %0a24,46c97,99%0a%3c Buena Vista, Lemon City, and Little River were founded before the turn of the 19th-century and represent some of the earliest settlements in Miami-Dade County. The area known as Buena Vista was once a small village adjoining, but not within the corporate limits of Miami proper. Although preceded in age by pioneer Lemon City, a town located a little further north, the small village of Buena Vista dates its birth, development, and growth along with Miami's. The founding of Buena Vista dates back to the days when the immense rock ridge extending between the Atlantic Ocean and the Florida Everglades was covered by a dense pine forest. The earliest history of the village is recorded in a survey made by government surveyors, and the locations of the land tracts are to this date still founded on this early document.%0a%3c %0a%3c The land which became Buena Vista was originally part of the homesteads of William Henry Gleason and E.L. White. Gleason, a prominent and somewhat notorious figure in early Miami-Dade County politics, arrived in Miami after the Civil War was elected Lieutenant Governor of Florida. He left the area in 1876 but retained his homestead for several years, eventually turning it over to his son. As early as 1892, E.L. White homesteaded the area from North 41st Street to 54th Street between West 2nd Avenue and East 2nd Avenue. This was the area from which the Biltmore and Shadowlawn Subdivisions, which today make up the "Buena Vista East Historic District", were carved in the early 1920s.%0a%3c %0a%3c The arrival of the railroad in 1896 marked the end of an era for the pioneer bayfront village of Lemon City, which had enjoyed tremendous importance to the Miami area by virtue of its docks. Now the train brought much needed supplies to the rest of Dade County, and lured people away from the bayfront community to Miami and its outlying areas. The Lemon City depot, built in 1896, drew business further west away from the bay, and the small village of Buena Vista gradually developed. One of the earliest subdivisions in the Buena Vista areas was the Buena Vista Biscayne Badger Club Subdivision, which was developed in 1910 as a bayfront community with a private water plant, streets, and a park with recreation dock on the bay. However, it was inland where the village took shape. By 1910, suburban Buena Vista could boast of one hotel known as the Courley House, its very own railroad depot on the Florida East Coast Railway line, a small post office building, tropical fruit groves, a fruit-packing house, a grocery store, and one religious institution, the Holy Cross Episcopal Church.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c In the decades that followed its incorporation, growth was steady. A variety of architectural styles were introduced, yet the community emerged as the type of development the Shoreland Company envisioned. The community retains many of its original characteristics well situated and serviced by major highways, having tree-lined streets and wide roads, a downtown area, well-maintained homes provided with efficient services. and a variety of community activities.%0a%3c %0a%3c As Miami's population expanded during the late 1920s and early 1920s, new subdivisions reached northward along Biscayne Bay. In 1922, a large, undeveloped bayfront tract near the northern city limits was platted. Called Bay Shore, this area was subdivided by the Bay Shore Investment Company and was the first of three phases that would be developed by the company between 1922 and 1924.Houses constructed in the Morningside Historic District reflect the eclecticism popular in the early twentieth century. The earlier buildings in the district are predominantly Mediterranean Revival in style, while structures built in the 1930s and early 1940s are frequently Art Deco. Outstanding examples of both styles are found here. Morningside also features a large number of masonry vernacular buildings that frequently utilize elements of several styles. An unusual Tudor Revival style house and one of the City's best examples of Mission style architecture add to the area's architectural diversity.%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#to]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25''Allapattah''%25%25%0a%3c %25center%25https://i.imgur.com/B3166ls.jpg%0a%3c Allapattah is a neighborhood mostly in the city of Miami, Florida, and partly in metropolitan Miami, United States. As of May 2011, the county-owned portion of Allapattah, from State Road 9 to LeJeune Road, is being annexed by the city proper.%0a%3c %0a%3c A stretch in the neighborhood along NW 17th Avenue was nicknamed Little Santo Domingo in 2003, in an effort spurred by former Miami mayor and longtime city commissioner Wilfredo "Willy" Gort to honor the sizable Dominican American population in the community%0a%3c %0a%3c The name is derived from the Seminole Indian language word meaning alligator. The initial settlement of the Allapattah community began in 1856 when William P. Wagner, the earliest documented white American permanent settler, arrived from Charleston, South Carolina and established a homestead on a hammock along the Miami Rock Ridge, where Miami Jackson High School presently stands. Development ensued from 1896 and into the 20th century in the area with the completion of the Florida East Coast Railroad (FEC).%0a%3c %0a%3c Allapattah was predominantly populated by whites from early in the 20th century until the late 1950s, when there was a large influx of black Americans displaced by the construction of I-95 (then, the North-South Expressway) in the 1950s and 1960s, leading to white flight to suburban Miami-Dade County and Broward County. Cubans migrated to Miami neighborhoods like Allapattah in large numbers following the Cuban Revolution of 1959, hosting one of Miami's largest Cuban American populations. The 1980s brought influxes of Dominican Americans, Nicaraguans, Hondurans, and Haitians in the aftermath of various refugee crises in those nations. Now, a melting pot of residents from all across the Caribbean, Central America, and Latin America reside in the area.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> The Bayside Historic District remains today as an intact, cohesive neighborhood.

As of May 2011, the county-owned portion of Allapattah, from State Road 9 to LeJeune Road, is being annexed by the city proper.%0a%3c %0a%3c A stretch in the neighborhood along NW 17th Avenue was nicknamed Little Santo Domingo in 2003, in an effort spurred by former Miami mayor and longtime city commissioner Wilfredo "Willy" Gort to honor the sizable Dominican American population in the community%0a%3c %0a%3c The name is derived from the Seminole Indian language word meaning alligator. The initial settlement of the Allapattah community began in 1856 when William P. Wagner, the earliest documented white American permanent settler, arrived from Charleston, South Carolina and established a homestead on a hammock along the Miami Rock Ridge, where Miami Jackson High School presently stands. Development ensued from 1896 and into the 20th century in the area with the completion of the Florida East Coast Railroad (FEC).%0a%3c %0a%3c Allapattah was predominantly populated by whites from early in the 20th century until the late 1950s, when there was a large influx of black Americans displaced by the construction of I-95 (then, the North-South Expressway) in the 1950s and 1960s, leading to white flight to suburban Miami-Dade County and Broward County. Cubans migrated to Miami neighborhoods like Allapattah in large numbers following the Cuban Revolution of 1959, hosting one of Miami's largest Cuban American populations. The 1980s brought influxes of Dominican Americans, Nicaraguans, Hondurans, and Haitians in the aftermath of various refugee crises in those nations. Now, a melting pot of residents from all across the Caribbean, Central America, and Latin America reside in the area.%0a%3c %0a%3c A thriving textiles market is located along Northwest 20th Street between Northwest 17th and 27th Avenues, with several garment manufacturing and wholesale outlets from Latin America and the Caribbean makers along the row.

These were the various enterprises in which the early pioneers were engaged and with the coming of the railroad and its stop at the Biscayne Station, they were able to live off the land. Two of the most successful growers were Major Hugh Gordon and T.V. Moore. T.V. Moore owned the land in what is today's commercial district, while the Gordon Tract bordered the bay. By 1922, Lee T. Cooper, who had amassed his wealth from a patent medicine by the name of Tanlac, purchased T.V. Moore's land holdings. Cooper planned to develop the area and named it Bay View Estates. In 1924, the Shoreland Company purchased the Gordon Tract, Bay View Estates and other scattered acreage in order to create Miami Shores, "America's Mediterranean."%0a> %0a> Hugh M. Anderson, president of the Shoreland Company, and its board of directors were experienced real estate developers. They previously completed the successful development of the Venetian Islands and they decided that their new project would be similar &#65533; residences of Italian inspired architecture within a landscape associated with water. The master development plan for Greater Miami Shores included 9,000 building sites, 5 2/3 miles of bay frontage, four miles of inland waterways and ten miles of main roadways. The plans also called for the construction of a causeway to Miami Beach, a golf course, a country club, a yacht club, a business district, apartment buildings, hotels, a school and churches, a railroad station and beautifying features such as parks, plazas and entryways.%0a> %0a> Early in 1926, it was reported that approximately 50 homes had been completed, another 50 were under construction, and an additional 100 were being planned. The commercial building program was in progress, sidewalks and roadways were being laid out and lighting and landscape work was well underway. Record setting sales and resales of property were being recorded. Unfortunately, on September 18, 1926, all plans for the community came to a halt with the arrival of a devastating hurricane. In addition, other factors contributed to the Shoreland Company's bankruptcy in 1927.%0a> %0a> The present Miami Shores roughly corresponds with the original "Biscayne" neighborhood of the City of Miami. With the arrival of the Great Depression, the City of Miami gave up its jurisdiction and the area incorporated under the name Miami Shores Village in 1932. Previously, part of the area that now comprises the City of North Miami had been known as Miami Shores. Under the leadership of Roy H. Hawkins, a request to grant a charter creating Miami Shores Village was presented in the State Legislature. On January 2, 1932, the Village became official at a council meeting. The charter named the following five members to the first council: Hugh H. Gordon, a banker whose father had owned the Gordon Tract; Frank O. Pruitt, who was in the insurance business; John M. Carlisle, president of the Eli Witt Cigar Company; W.F. Andes, a prominent dentist; and M.R. Harrison, a general contractor, who constructed much of Biscayne Boulevard. At this first meeting, Pruitt was elected mayor, and other appointments were made including Village Manager Miller Williams, Village Attorney George E. Holt, and a single policeman, Ed Badger.%0a> %0a> In the decades that followed its incorporation, growth was steady. A variety of architectural styles were introduced, yet the community emerged as the type of development the Shoreland Company envisioned.

During the Land Boom of the 1920s, the area was developed as the Biltmore and Shadowlawn subdivisions. Originally home to many Florida cracker immigrants from Georgia and North Carolina, the neighborhood soon became popular with the owners of nearby businesses. The houses reflect their original owners' rising social status and include fine examples of Mediterranean Revival, Mission, Craftsman, and Art Deco architecture style residences.%0a%3c %0a%3c Buena Vista, Lemon City, and Little River were founded before the turn of the 19th-century and represent some of the earliest settlements in Miami-Dade County. The area known as Buena Vista was once a small village adjoining, but not within the corporate limits of Miami proper. Although preceded in age by pioneer Lemon City, a town located a little further north, the small village of Buena Vista dates its birth, development, and growth along with Miami&#65533;s. The founding of Buena Vista dates back to the days when the immense rock ridge extending between the Atlantic Ocean and the Florida Everglades was covered by a dense pine forest. The earliest history of the village is recorded in a survey made by government surveyors, and the locations of the land tracts are to this date still founded on this early document.%0a%3c The land which became Buena Vista was originally part of the homesteads of William Henry Gleason and E.L. White. Gleason, a prominent and somewhat notorious figure in early Miami-Dade County politics, arrived in Miami after the Civil War was elected Lieutenant Governor of Florida. He left the area in 1876 but retained his homestead for several years, eventually turning it over to his son. As early as 1892, E.L. White homesteaded the area from North 41st Street to 54th Street between West 2nd Avenue and East 2nd Avenue. This was the area from which the Biltmore and Shadowlawn Subdivisions, which today make up the "Buena Vista East Historic District", were carved in the early 1920s.%0a%3c %0a%3c The arrival of the railroad in 1896 marked the end of an era for the pioneer bayfront village of Lemon City, which had enjoyed tremendous importance to the Miami area by virtue of its docks. Now the train brought much needed supplies to the rest of Dade County, and lured people away from the bayfront community to Miami and its outlying areas. The Lemon City depot, built in 1896, drew business further west away from the bay, and the small village of Buena Vista gradually developed. One of the earliest subdivisions in the Buena Vista areas was the Buena Vista Biscayne Badger Club Subdivision, which was developed in 1910 as a bayfront community with a private water plant, streets, and a park with recreation dock on the bay. However, it was inland where the village took shape. By 1910, suburban Buena Vista could boast of one hotel known as the Courley House, its very own railroad depot on the Florida East Coast Railway line, a small post office building, tropical fruit groves, a fruit-packing house, a grocery store, and one religious institution, the Holy Cross Episcopal Church.%0a%3c %0a%3c Other prominent citizens acquired land in Buena Vista. Among them was the millionaire, Charles Deering, who purchased a large tract of bayfront land east of the railroad, in the area now known as the Upper Eastside. This land is where the "Baypoint" neighborhood is now located. Much of the area fronting the bay was naturally wooded, and here Deering created an arboretum and sanctuary for birds and animals. There were no public roadways in the area east of the railroad, and since Deering strongly opposed the opening of such streets, the area was preserved in its pristine, virgin state for many years.%0a%3c %0a%3c As the population of Miami grew between the late 1910s through the Boom era of the early 1920s, new areas reached northward along the old Dixie Highway (N.E. 2nd Avenue) and Avenue D (N. Miami Avenue), which was extended northward from N.E. 36th Street. The northern city limit of Miami was moved to N.E. 38th Street, and this took in a part of Buena Vista. Finally, on August 4, 1924, the new town of Buena Vista was incorporated and, together with the other incorporated areas of Coconut Grove and Silver Bluff, was annexed to the City of Miami the following year.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!%25center%25''Bayside''%25%25%0a> %0a> The Bayside Historic District reflects the formative years of the early 1900s through the mid-1940s.

Development took off during the Boom years of the mid-1920s, however, when Wykoff and Estes Builders constructed an outstanding cluster of large, two-story Mediterranean Revival style houses near the eastern end of NE 70th Street.%0a> %0a> The last subdivision to be subdivided was Washington Place, which was also developed between 1925 and the mid-1940s. Samuel J. Prescott, who platted the subdivision in 1925, had constructed his own winter home at 7101 N.E. 10th Avenue some years before. The house remains today as one of the last intact bayfront estates in Northeast Miami. The estate once featured a recreational golf course for residents and guests. Prescott was the founder of the firm of Samuel J. Prescott Co., Inc., building contractors, which developed several significant buildings in downtown Washington, D.C. Prescott was chairman of the board of the Second National Bank of Washington, D.C., president of the Master Builders Association, the Builders and Manufacturers Exchange, and the Prescott Farms Company of New Hampshire.%0a> %0a> The Bayside Historic District remains today as an intact, cohesive neighborhood. Despite the number of post-1941 buildings, Bayside retains a high level of historic and architectural integrity.Houses constructed in Bayside reflect the diversity, direction, and taste of individual residents as well as the architectural eclecticism prevalent in the early-20th century. The earlier buildings in the district are Frame Vernacular, with several examples of early bungalows. Houses built in the 1920s are generally Mediterranean Revival in style, while structures built in the 1930s and 1940s are frequently Art Deco. Bayside also features a number of excellent examples of other architectural styles, including Mission Revival, Streamline Moderne, and Florida Ranch. Other structures, best described as Masonry Vernacular, add to the area's architectural diversity.%0a> %0a> %0a152,153c136,137%0a%3c !!!!'''Average Resources''' ••%0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' •••%0a> %0a155d138%0a%3c *Buena Vista East Historic District%0a158c141,142%0a%3c %0a---%0a> *Link%0a> %0a161,210c145,153%0a%3c !!%25center%25''Design District''%25%25%0a%3c %0a%3c The Miami Design District is a neighborhood in Miami, Florida, United States and a shopping, dining and cultural destination.

The area served as home to prominent figures such as Kelsey Pharr, M. Athalie Range (the first black American elected to serve on the Miami city commission) and boxer Muhammad Ali.

During the Land Boom of the 1920s, the area was developed as the Biltmore and Shadowlawn subdivisions. Originally home to many Florida cracker immigrants from Georgia and North Carolina, the neighborhood soon became popular with the owners of nearby businesses. The houses reflect their original owners' rising social status and include fine examples of Mediterranean Revival, Mission, Craftsman, and Art Deco architecture style residences.%0a> %0a> Buena Vista, Lemon City, and Little River were founded before the turn of the 19th-century and represent some of the earliest settlements in Miami-Dade County. The area known as Buena Vista was once a small village adjoining, but not within the corporate limits of Miami proper. Although preceded in age by pioneer Lemon City, a town located a little further north, the small village of Buena Vista dates its birth, development, and growth along with Miami&#65533;s. The founding of Buena Vista dates back to the days when the immense rock ridge extending between the Atlantic Ocean and the Florida Everglades was covered by a dense pine forest. The earliest history of the village is recorded in a survey made by government surveyors, and the locations of the land tracts are to this date still founded on this early document.%0a> The land which became Buena Vista was originally part of the homesteads of William Henry Gleason and E.L. White. Gleason, a prominent and somewhat notorious figure in early Miami-Dade County politics, arrived in Miami after the Civil War was elected Lieutenant Governor of Florida. He left the area in 1876 but retained his homestead for several years, eventually turning it over to his son. As early as 1892, E.L. White homesteaded the area from North 41st Street to 54th Street between West 2nd Avenue and East 2nd Avenue. This was the area from which the Biltmore and Shadowlawn Subdivisions, which today make up the "Buena Vista East Historic District", were carved in the early 1920s.%0a> %0a> The arrival of the railroad in 1896 marked the end of an era for the pioneer bayfront village of Lemon City, which had enjoyed tremendous importance to the Miami area by virtue of its docks. Now the train brought much needed supplies to the rest of Dade County, and lured people away from the bayfront community to Miami and its outlying areas. The Lemon City depot, built in 1896, drew business further west away from the bay, and the small village of Buena Vista gradually developed. One of the earliest subdivisions in the Buena Vista areas was the Buena Vista Biscayne Badger Club Subdivision, which was developed in 1910 as a bayfront community with a private water plant, streets, and a park with recreation dock on the bay. However, it was inland where the village took shape. By 1910, suburban Buena Vista could boast of one hotel known as the Courley House, its very own railroad depot on the Florida East Coast Railway line, a small post office building, tropical fruit groves, a fruit-packing house, a grocery store, and one religious institution, the Holy Cross Episcopal Church.%0a> %0a> Other prominent citizens acquired land in Buena Vista. Among them was the millionaire, Charles Deering, who purchased a large tract of bayfront land east of the railroad, in the area now known as the Upper Eastside. This land is where the "Baypoint" neighborhood is now located. Much of the area fronting the bay was naturally wooded, and here Deering created an arboretum and sanctuary for birds and animals. There were no public roadways in the area east of the railroad, and since Deering strongly opposed the opening of such streets, the area was preserved in its pristine, virgin state for many years.%0a> %0a> As the population of Miami grew between the late 1910s through the Boom era of the early 1920s, new areas reached northward along the old Dixie Highway (N.E. 2nd Avenue) and Avenue D (N. Miami Avenue), which was extended northward from N.E. 36th Street. The northern city limit of Miami was moved to N.E. 38th Street, and this took in a part of Buena Vista. Finally, on August 4, 1924, the new town of Buena Vista was incorporated and, together with the other incorporated areas of Coconut Grove and Silver Bluff, was annexed to the City of Miami the following year.%0a> %0a> %0a254,255c214,215%0a%3c !!!!'''Average Resources''' • to ••%0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' ••%0a> %0a257,262c217,220%0a%3c *Little Haiti&#65533;s main strip%0a%3c *The Little Haiti Community Garden%0a%3c *Athalie Range Park%0a%3c *Caribbean Marketplace%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> *Buena Vista East Historic District%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> %0a265,279c223,233%0a%3c !!%25center%25''Liberty City''%25%25%0a%3c %0a%3c Once a part of the sparsely populated outskirts of northern Miami, what became Liberty City developed during the Great Depression of the 1930s when President Franklin D.

More recently Morningside was the first historic area in central Miami to experience gentrification with an influx of more-affluent residents. It has now been fully restored. The Morningside Historic District runs from NE 55th Street to NE 60th Street; it was the first historic district to be designated as such in the City of Miami. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992 as the Bay Shore Historic District.%0a> %0a> The Morningside Historic District is significant to the history of architecture, landscape architecture, and community development in Miami. Developed primarily between 1922 and 1941, Morningside contains a wealth of Mediterranean, Art Deco, and vernacular style houses that reflect the diversity and direction of architectural design during the 1920s and 1930s. Morningside is one of Miami's best planned subdivisions, featuring wide, tree-lined boulevards that contribute to the character of the area. This neighborhood was envisioned as an exclusive, residential community, and its amenities and location on Biscayne Bay attracted many influential and prominent local residents. One of Miami's most intact historic neighborhoods, Morningside is the City's best remaining example of a boom-era suburb.%0a> %0a> The Morningside Historic District stands today as one of Miami's most intact historic neighborhoods. Despite the number of post-1941 buildings in the area, Morningside retains a high degree of historic and architectural integrity. This is due, in part, to the fact that most later buildings are not intrusive, but respect the earlier structures in scale, setback, materials, and workmanship. The majority of neighborhood residents recognize the special character of the area and desire its continued preservation.%0a> %0a> As Miami's population expanded during the late 1920s and early 1920s, new subdivisions reached northward along Biscayne Bay. In 1922, a large, undeveloped bayfront tract near the northern city limits was platted. Called Bay Shore, this area was subdivided by the Bay Shore Investment Company and was the first of three phases that would be developed by the company between 1922 and 1924.Houses constructed in the Morningside Historic District reflect the eclecticism popular in the early twentieth century. The earlier buildings in the district are predominantly Mediterranean Revival in style, while structures built in the 1930s and early 1940s are frequently Art Deco. Outstanding examples of both styles are found here. Morningside also features a large number of masonry vernacular buildings that frequently utilize elements of several styles. An unusual Tudor Revival style house and one of the City's best examples of Mission style architecture add to the area's architectural diversity.%0a> %0a> %0a283,284c237,238%0a%3c !!!!'''Average Resources''' • to ••%0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' •••%0a> %0a286,291c240,243%0a%3c *Miami Dade College%0a%3c *Model City Library%0a%3c *Sandrell Rivers Theater%0a%3c *Charles Hardley Park%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> %0a294,300c246,264%0a%3c !!%25center%25''Little River''%25%25%0a%3c %0a%3c Little River is a neighborhood in Miami, Florida.

Once a part of the pioneer settlement of Lemon City, Bayside contains the oldest intact community in Northeast Miami, as well as one of this area's last remaining bayfront estates. From its onset, Bayside was the home of many prominent residents who played significant roles in the business life of both Lemon City and Miami.%0a> %0a> Bayside has four distinct subdivisions which were platted between 1909 and 1925, although the area itself was first settled in the late nineteenth century. These subdivisions include Elmira (N.E. 68th Street and N.E. 67th Street), which was platted in 1909; Acadia (N.E. 70th Street), which was platted in 1915; Baywood (N.E. 69th Street and the south side of N.E. 71st Street), which was platted in 1921 and added to in 1924; and Washington Place (N.E. 72nd Street and the north side of N.E. 71st Street), which was platted in 1925.%0a> %0a> In 1909, William B. and Fred C. Miller (not related) subdivided a seven-acre bayfront lot on today's N.E. 68th Street. The Millers had come to Florida in the late 1880s from Elmira, New York and had developed Elmira Farms near Arch Creek. Their new subdivision was named Elmira, and oolitic limestone gates announced the entrance to the new community.%0a> %0a> While much of what was Lemon City has been engulfed by later developments, Elmira has remained virtually intact. Although many of its houses have deteriorated, and newer buildings have been added, the street retains much of its early character. Elmira is characterized by its excellent collection of Frame Vernacular buildings, many of which were inspired by Northern architectural styles. The Elmira Club at 742 N.E. 68th Street, for example, has Dutch Colonial Revival influences, while other houses display classical details. The majority of houses were constructed in the 1910s.%0a> %0a> The Acadia subdivision was platted in 1915 by the Realty Securities Corporation and George E. Merrick. Although the subdivision evokes the memory of Longfellow with such names as Acadian Way, Evangeline Circle, Tropical Trail, and Druid Walk, the houses developed here are distinctly Mediterranean Revival in influence. This is due perhaps to the fact that only two houses were constructed prior to 1925. Development took off during the Boom years of the mid-1920s, however, when Wykoff and Estes Builders constructed an outstanding cluster of large, two-story Mediterranean Revival style houses near the eastern end of NE 70th Street.%0a> %0a> The last subdivision to be subdivided was Washington Place, which was also developed between 1925 and the mid-1940s. Samuel J. Prescott, who platted the subdivision in 1925, had constructed his own winter home at 7101 N.E. 10th Avenue some years before. The house remains today as one of the last intact bayfront estates in Northeast Miami. The estate once featured a recreational golf course for residents and guests. Prescott was founder of the firm of Samuel J. Prescott Co., Inc., building contractors, which developed several significant buildings in downtown Washington, D.C. Prescott was chairman of the board of the Second National Bank of Washington, D.C., president of the Master Builders Association, the Builders and Manufacturers Exchange, and the Prescott Farms Company of New Hampshire.%0a> %0a> The Bayside Historic District remains today as an intact, cohesive neighborhood. Despite the number of post-1941 buildings, Bayside retains a high level of historic and architectural integrity.%0a> Houses constructed in Bayside reflect the diversity, direction, and taste of individual residents as well as the architectural eclecticism prevalent in the early-20th century. The earlier buildings in the district are Frame Vernacular, with several examples of early bungalows. Houses built in the 1920s are generally Mediterranean Revival in style, while structures built in the 1930s and 1940s are frequently Art Deco. Bayside also features a number of excellent examples of other architectural styles, including Mission Revival, Streamline Moderne, and Florida Ranch. Other structures, best described as Masonry Vernacular, add to the area's architectural diversity.%0a> %0a> %0a> %0a307,312c271,274%0a%3c *Cathedral of St. Mary%0a%3c *Little River Studios%0a%3c *Little River Cooperative%0a%3c *Earth N Us Farm%0a%3c *[[Players.TheWaystation|The Waystation]]%0a%3c %0a---%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> %0a315,342d276%0a%3c !!%25center%25''Miami Shores''%0a%3c %0a%3c By the early 1900s, the area encompassing today's Miami Shores Village was occupied by a starch (coontie) mill, a tomato packing plant, a saw mill, a pineapple plantation and a grapefruit grove. These were the various enterprises in which the early pioneers were engaged and with the coming of the railroad and its stop at the Biscayne Station, they were able to live off the land. Two of the most successful growers were Major Hugh Gordon and T.V. Moore. T.V. Moore owned the land in what is today's commercial district, while the Gordon Tract bordered the bay. By 1922, Lee T. Cooper, who had amassed his wealth from a patent medicine by the name of Tanlac, purchased T.V. Moore's land holdings. Cooper planned to develop the area and named it Bay View Estates. In 1924, the Shoreland Company purchased the Gordon Tract, Bay View Estates and other scattered acreage in order to create Miami Shores, "America's Mediterranean."%0a%3c %0a%3c Hugh M. Anderson, president of the Shoreland Company, and its board of directors were experienced real estate developers. They previously completed the successful development of the Venetian Islands and they decided that their new project would be similar &#65533; residences of Italian inspired architecture within a landscape associated with water. The master development plan for Greater Miami Shores included 9,000 building sites, 5 2/3 miles of bay frontage, four miles of inland waterways and ten miles of main roadways. The plans also called for the construction of a causeway to Miami Beach, a golf course, a country club, a yacht club, a business district, apartment buildings, hotels, a school and churches, a railroad station and beautifying features such as parks, plazas and entryways.%0a%3c %0a%3c Early in 1926, it was reported that approximately 50 homes had been completed, another 50 were under construction, and an additional 100 were being planned. The commercial building program was in progress, sidewalks and roadways were being laid out and lighting and landscape work was well underway. Record setting sales and resales of property were being recorded. Unfortunately, on September 18, 1926, all plans for the community came to a halt with the arrival of a devastating hurricane. In addition, other factors contributed to the Shoreland Company's bankruptcy in 1927.%0a%3c %0a%3c The present Miami Shores roughly corresponds with the original "Biscayne" neighborhood of the City of Miami. With the arrival of the Great Depression, the City of Miami gave up its jurisdiction and the area incorporated under the name Miami Shores Village in 1932. Previously, part of the area that now comprises the City of North Miami had been known as Miami Shores. Under the leadership of Roy H. Hawkins, a request to grant a charter creating Miami Shores Village was presented in the State Legislature. On January 2, 1932, the Village became official at a council meeting. The charter named the following five members to the first council: Hugh H. Gordon, a banker whose father had owned the Gordon Tract; Frank O. Pruitt, who was in the insurance business; John M. Carlisle, president of the Eli Witt Cigar Company; W.F. Andes, a prominent dentist; and M.R. Harrison, a general contractor, who constructed much of Biscayne Boulevard. At this first meeting, Pruitt was elected mayor, and other appointments were made including Village Manager Miller Williams, Village Attorney George E. Holt, and a single policeman, Ed Badger.%0a%3c %0a%3c In the decades that followed its incorporation, growth was steady. A variety of architectural styles were introduced, yet the community emerged as the type of development the Shoreland Company envisioned. The community retains many of its original characteristics &#65533; well situated and serviced by major highways, having tree-lined streets and wide roads, a downtown area, well-maintained homes provided with efficient services. and a variety of community activities.%0a%3c %0a%3c Today, Miami Shores is primarily a bedroom community for those working in Greater Miami, and has a sizeable retired population. The village is mostly single family residential homes, with very few multi-family units and only two small commercial areas along Northeast 2nd Avenue and Biscayne Boulevard.%0a%3c %0a%3c While it is frequently referred to as Miami Shores or the Village of Miami Shores, the municipality's official name under its charter is Miami Shores Village.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Average Resources''' •••%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Locations'''%0a%3c *Barry's University%0a%3c *Brockway Memorial Library%0a%3c *Miami Shores Country Club%0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a367,377c301,350%0a%3c !!%25center%25''Morning Side''%0a%3c %0a%3c Started in the 1920s as "Bay Shore," it prospered in the mid-20th century and fell on hard times along with most of Miami's other inner city neighborhoods in the 60's and 70's. More recently Morningside was the first historic area in central Miami to experience gentrification with an influx of more-affluent residents. It has now been fully restored. The Morningside Historic District runs from NE 55th Street to NE 60th Street; it was the first historic district to be designated as such in the City of Miami. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992 as the Bay Shore Historic District.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Morningside Historic District is significant to the history of architecture, landscape architecture, and community development in Miami. Developed primarily between 1922 and 1941, Morningside contains a wealth of Mediterranean, Art Deco, and vernacular style houses that reflect the diversity and direction of architectural design during the 1920s and 1930s. Morningside is one of Miami's best planned subdivisions, featuring wide, tree-lined boulevards that contribute to the character of the area. This neighborhood was envisioned as an exclusive, residential community, and its amenities and location on Biscayne Bay attracted many influential and prominent local residents. One of Miami's most intact historic neighborhoods, Morningside is the City's best remaining example of a boom-era suburb.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Morningside Historic District stands today as one of Miami's most intact historic neighborhoods. Despite the number of post-1941 buildings in the area, Morningside retains a high degree of historic and architectural integrity. This is due, in part, to the fact that most later buildings are not intrusive, but respect the earlier structures in scale, setback, materials, and workmanship. The majority of neighborhood residents recognize the special character of the area and desire its continued preservation.%0a%3c %0a%3c As Miami's population expanded during the late 1920s and early 1920s, new subdivisions reached northward along Biscayne Bay. In 1922, a large, undeveloped bayfront tract near the northern city limits was platted. Called Bay Shore, this area was subdivided by the Bay Shore Investment Company and was the first of three phases that would be developed by the company between 1922 and 1924.Houses constructed in the Morningside Historic District reflect the eclecticism popular in the early twentieth century. The earlier buildings in the district are predominantly Mediterranean Revival in style, while structures built in the 1930s and early 1940s are frequently Art Deco. Outstanding examples of both styles are found here. Morningside also features a large number of masonry vernacular buildings that frequently utilize elements of several styles. An unusual Tudor Revival style house and one of the City's best examples of Mission style architecture add to the area's architectural diversity.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!%25center%25''Design District''%25%25%0a> %0a> The Miami Design District is a neighborhood in Miami, Florida, United States and a shopping, dining and cultural destination. The Design District was redeveloped in the early 2000's under the direction of developer Craig Robins, president and CEO of Dacra, and L Real Estate with investment from General Growth Properties. It is home to over 130 art galleries, showrooms, creative services, architecture firms, luxury fashion stores, antiques dealers, eateries and bars. %0a> %0a> The Design District is in the crossroads of many prominent Miami neighborhoods, with the artsy Wynwood neighborhood to the south, Lemon City (Little Haiti) and the historic 1920s Buena Vista neighborhood to the north, and the wealthy Upper East Side neighborhoods to the east.

These were the various enterprises in which the early pioneers were engaged and with the coming of the railroad and its stop at the Biscayne Station, they were able to live off the land. Two of the most successful growers were Major Hugh Gordon and T.V. Moore. T.V. Moore owned the land in what is today's commercial district, while the Gordon Tract bordered the bay. By 1922, Lee T. Cooper, who had amassed his wealth from a patent medicine by the name of Tanlac, purchased T.V. Moore's land holdings. Cooper planned to develop the area and named it Bay View Estates. In 1924, the Shoreland Company purchased the Gordon Tract, Bay View Estates and other scattered acreage in order to create Miami Shores, "America's Mediterranean."%0a%3c %0a%3c Hugh M. Anderson, president of the Shoreland Company, and its board of directors were experienced real estate developers. They previously completed the successful development of the Venetian Islands and they decided that their new project would be similar &#65533; residences of Italian inspired architecture within a landscape associated with water. The master development plan for Greater Miami Shores included 9,000 building sites, 5 2/3 miles of bay frontage, four miles of inland waterways and ten miles of main roadways. The plans also called for the construction of a causeway to Miami Beach, a golf course, a country club, a yacht club, a business district, apartment buildings, hotels, a school and churches, a railroad station and beautifying features such as parks, plazas and entryways.%0a%3c %0a%3c Early in 1926, it was reported that approximately 50 homes had been completed, another 50 were under construction, and an additional 100 were being planned. The commercial building program was in progress, sidewalks and roadways were being laid out and lighting and landscape work was well underway. Record setting sales and resales of property were being recorded. Unfortunately, on September 18, 1926, all plans for the community came to a halt with the arrival of a devastating hurricane. In addition, other factors contributed to the Shoreland Company's bankruptcy in 1927.%0a%3c %0a%3c The present Miami Shores roughly corresponds with the original "Biscayne" neighborhood of the City of Miami. With the arrival of the Great Depression, the City of Miami gave up its jurisdiction and the area incorporated under the name Miami Shores Village in 1932. Previously, part of the area that now comprises the City of North Miami had been known as Miami Shores. Under the leadership of Roy H. Hawkins, a request to grant a charter creating Miami Shores Village was presented in the State Legislature. On January 2, 1932, the Village became official at a council meeting. The charter named the following five members to the first council: Hugh H. Gordon, a banker whose father had owned the Gordon Tract; Frank O. Pruitt, who was in the insurance business; John M. Carlisle, president of the Eli Witt Cigar Company; W.F. Andes, a prominent dentist; and M.R. Harrison, a general contractor, who constructed much of Biscayne Boulevard. At this first meeting, Pruitt was elected mayor, and other appointments were made including Village Manager Miller Williams, Village Attorney George E. Holt, and a single policeman, Ed Badger.%0a%3c %0a%3c In the decades that followed its incorporation, growth was steady. A variety of architectural styles were introduced, yet the community emerged as the type of development the Shoreland Company envisioned. The community retains many of its original characteristics ï¿½ well situated and serviced by major highways, having tree-lined streets and wide roads, a downtown area, well-maintained homes provided with efficient services. and a variety of community activities.%0a%3c %0a%3c Today, Miami Shores is primarily a bedroom community for those working in Greater Miami, and has a sizeable retired population.

Once a part of the pioneer settlement of Lemon City, Bayside contains the oldest intact community in Northeast Miami, as well as one of this area's last remaining bayfront estates. From its onset, Bayside was the home of many prominent residents who played significant roles in the business life of both Lemon City and Miami.%0a%3c %0a%3c Bayside has four distinct subdivisions which were plated between 1909 and 1925, although the area itself was first settled in the late nineteenth century. These subdivisions include Elmira (N.E. 68th Street and N.E. 67th Street), which was platted in 1909; Acadia (N.E. 70th Street), which was platted in 1915; Baywood (N.E. 69th Street and the south side of N.E. 71st Street), which was platted in 1921 and added to in 1924; and Washington Place (N.E. 72nd Street and the north side of N.E. 71st Street), which was platted in 1925.%0a%3c %0a%3c In 1909, William B. and Fred C. Miller (not related) subdivided a seven-acre bayfront lot on today's N.E. 68th Street. The Millers had come to Florida in the late 1880s from Elmira, New York and had developed Elmira Farms near Arch Creek. Their new subdivision was named Elmira, and oolitic limestone gates announced the entrance to the new community.%0a%3c %0a%3c While much of what was Lemon City has been engulfed by later developments, Elmira has remained virtually intact. Although many of its houses have deteriorated, and newer buildings have been added, the street retains much of its early character. Elmira is characterized by its excellent collection of Frame Vernacular buildings, many of which were inspired by Northern architectural styles. The Elmira Club at 742 N.E. 68th Street, for example, has Dutch Colonial Revival influences, while other houses display classical details. The majority of houses were constructed in the 1910s.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Acadia subdivision was platted in 1915 by the Realty Securities Corporation and George E. Merrick. Although the subdivision evokes the memory of Longfellow with such names as Acadian Way, Evangeline Circle, Tropical Trail, and Druid Walk, the houses developed here are distinctly Mediterranean Revival in influence. This is due perhaps to the fact that only two houses were constructed prior to 1925. Development took off during the Boom years of the mid-1920s, however, when Wykoff and Estes Builders constructed an outstanding cluster of large, two-story Mediterranean Revival style houses near the eastern end of NE 70th Street.%0a%3c %0a%3c The last subdivision to be subdivided was Washington Place, which was also developed between 1925 and the mid-1940s. Samuel J. Prescott, who platted the subdivision in 1925, had constructed his own winter home at 7101 N.E. 10th Avenue some years before. The house remains today as one of the last intact bayfront estates in Northeast Miami. The estate once featured a recreational golf course for residents and guests. Prescott was the founder of the firm of Samuel J. Prescott Co., Inc., building contractors, which developed several significant buildings in downtown Washington, D.C. Prescott was chairman of the board of the Second National Bank of Washington, D.C., president of the Master Builders Association, the Builders and Manufacturers Exchange, and the Prescott Farms Company of New Hampshire.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Bayside Historic District remains today as an intact, cohesive neighborhood. Despite the number of post-1941 buildings, Bayside retains a high level of historic and architectural integrity.Houses constructed in Bayside reflect the diversity, direction, and taste of individual residents as well as the architectural eclecticism prevalent in the early-20th century. The earlier buildings in the district are Frame Vernacular, with several examples of early bungalows. Houses built in the 1920s are generally Mediterranean Revival in style, while structures built in the 1930s and 1940s are frequently Art Deco. Bayside also features a number of excellent examples of other architectural styles, including Mission Revival, Streamline Moderne, and Florida Ranch. Other structures, best described as Masonry Vernacular, add to the area's architectural diversity.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a%3c *%0a%3c *%0a%3c !!!!'''Average Resources''' â€¢â€¢â€¢%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Locations'''%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25''Lemon City(Little Haiti)''%25%25%0a%3c %0a%3c The area now known as Little Haiti was called Lemon City for well over a century. Several people settled near Biscayne Bay north of the Miami River after the civil war, squatting on unclaimed land. Some of the squatters eventually applied for homestead grants for the land they were squatting on. By 1889 a community had formed, with a post office named "Motto". "Lemon City" replaced "Motto" as the name of the community by 1893. A school had opened in 1890, and Lemon City also included several businesses and a newspaper, as well as port facilities on Biscayne Bay. With the extension of the Florida East Coast Railway to Miami in 1896, Miami quickly overshadowed Lemon City.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Portrait of Father Gï¿½rard Jean-Juste on a gable wall by Serge Toussaint in Little Haiti.%0a%3c Viter Juste, a noted Haitian businessman, activist and respected community leader, came up with the name of Little Haiti. According to Jean-Claude Exulien, a retired professor of history and friend of Juste's since 1977, Juste wrote an article in the Miami Herald in which he first referred to the neighborhood as "Little Port-au-Prince." However, editors at the Miami Herald found the name, "Little Port-au-Prince," too long, so the newspaper shortened the term in the headline to Little Haiti. Over the objections of historians and African-Americans, Miami commissioners in May 2016 voted in favor of designating Little Haiti as an official neighborhood with boundaries overlapping the historic Lemon City, which was founded by Bahamian immigrants before Miami existed.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a%3c *%0a%3c *%0a%3c !!!!'''Average Resources''' â€¢ to â€¢â€¢%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Locations'''%0a%3c *Little Haitiï¿½s main strip%0a%3c *The Little Haiti Community Garden%0a%3c *Athalie Range Park%0a%3c *Caribbean Marketplace%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25''Liberty City''%25%25%0a%3c %0a%3c Once a part of the sparsely populated outskirts of northern Miami, what became Liberty City developed during the Great Depression of the 1930s when President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized the construction of the Liberty Square housing project in 1933, the first of its kind in the Southern United States. Built as a response to the deteriorating housing conditions in densely populated and covenant-restricted slums of Overtown, construction on the initial housing project began in 1934 and opened in 1937.%0a%3c %0a%3c Into the 1940s and 1950s, the growing Liberty City and adjacent Brownsville thrived as a middle income black American community, hosting several churches, hospitals, and community centers. The area served as home to prominent figures such as Kelsey Pharr, M. Athalie Range (the first black American elected to serve on the Miami city commission) and boxer Muhammad Ali. Although segregation laws prohibited black Americans from resting and residing in popular Miami Beach, service establishment and resorts such as the Hampton House Motel and Villas catered to and entertained the likes of notables such as Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Althea Gibson, and even whites such as Mickey Mantle.%0a%3c %0a%3c Construction of Interstate 95 in Florida in Overtown and declining use of restrictive covenants in the wake of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 dramatically altered the neighborhood into the 1960s. Increasing numbers of lower income elderly and welfare-dependent families migrated to the Liberty City neighborhood following their displacement primarily from inner city Overtown, leading to large-scale black flight of middle and higher income blacks and other blacks like West Indian Americans largely to suburban areas like Florida City and Miami Gardens in southern and northern Dade County, respectively.%0a%3c %0a%3c Crime grew prevalent in the increasingly poverty-stricken area in the immediate postï¿½civil rights movement era of the 1960s and 1970s. The ensuing problems of the poor and disenfranchised grew most apparent and notable in race riots which occurred in Liberty City in August 1968 during the Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, and in 1980 following the acquittal of police officers charged with the killing of Arthur McDuffie.%0a%3c %0a%3c The plight of inner-city black Miamians increasingly came to be highlighted in national press into the 1980s as the Hurricanes football team of the University of Miami won several national college football championships led by players recruited from the mostly black, lower income neighborhoods such as Liberty City and Overtown. National exposure continued with the popularity of nationally broadcast programs such as the NBC crime drama Miami Vice, which brought the deteriorating conditions of the area to greater prominence.%0a%3c %0a%3c Into the 1990s and 2000s, the music grew to reflect the area with locals such as Luther Campbell of 2 Live Crew pioneering the Miami bass genre which dominated Southern hip hop music during the decade. Other music and sports talents rose to national prominence from the area such as rappers Trina and Trick Daddy and NFL players Chad "Ocho Cinco" Johnson, and Willis McGahee.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a%3c *%0a%3c *%0a%3c !!!!'''Average Resources''' â€¢ to â€¢â€¢%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Locations'''%0a%3c *Miami Dade College%0a%3c *Model City Library%0a%3c *Sandrell Rivers Theater%0a%3c *Charles Hardley Park%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25''Buena Vista''%0a%3c %0a%3c In the 1890s, Buena Vista was a small village whose founding and growth paralleled Miami's. During the Land Boom of the 1920s, the area was developed as the Biltmore and Shadowlawn subdivisions. Originally home to many Florida cracker immigrants from Georgia and North Carolina, the neighborhood soon became popular with the owners of nearby businesses. The houses reflect their original owners' rising social status and include fine examples of Mediterranean Revival, Mission, Craftsman, and Art Deco architecture style residences.%0a%3c %0a%3c Buena Vista, Lemon City, and Little River were founded before the turn of the 19th-century and represent some of the earliest settlements in Miami-Dade County. The area known as Buena Vista was once a small village adjoining, but not within the corporate limits of Miami proper. Although preceded in age by pioneer Lemon City, a town located a little further north, the small village of Buena Vista dates its birth, development, and growth along with Miamiï¿½s. The founding of Buena Vista dates back to the days when the immense rock ridge extending between the Atlantic Ocean and the Florida Everglades was covered by a dense pine forest. The earliest history of the village is recorded in a survey made by government surveyors, and the locations of the land tracts are to this date still founded on this early document.%0a%3c The land which became Buena Vista was originally part of the homesteads of William Henry Gleason and E.L. White. Gleason, a prominent and somewhat notorious figure in early Miami-Dade County politics, arrived in Miami after the Civil War was elected Lieutenant Governor of Florida. He left the area in 1876 but retained his homestead for several years, eventually turning it over to his son. As early as 1892, E.L. White homesteaded the area from North 41st Street to 54th Street between West 2nd Avenue and East 2nd Avenue. This was the area from which the Biltmore and Shadowlawn Subdivisions, which today make up the "Buena Vista East Historic District", were carved in the early 1920s.%0a%3c %0a%3c The arrival of the railroad in 1896 marked the end of an era for the pioneer bayfront village of Lemon City, which had enjoyed tremendous importance to the Miami area by virtue of its docks. Now the train brought much needed supplies to the rest of Dade County, and lured people away from the bayfront community to Miami and its outlying areas. The Lemon City depot, built in 1896, drew business further west away from the bay, and the small village of Buena Vista gradually developed. One of the earliest subdivisions in the Buena Vista areas was the Buena Vista Biscayne Badger Club Subdivision, which was developed in 1910 as a bayfront community with a private water plant, streets, and a park with recreation dock on the bay. However, it was inland where the village took shape. By 1910, suburban Buena Vista could boast of one hotel known as the Courley House, its very own railroad depot on the Florida East Coast Railway line, a small post office building, tropical fruit groves, a fruit-packing house, a grocery store, and one religious institution, the Holy Cross Episcopal Church.%0a%3c %0a%3c Other prominent citizens acquired land in Buena Vista. Among them was the millionaire, Charles Deering, who purchased a large tract of bayfront land east of the railroad, in the area now known as the Upper Eastside. This land is where the "Baypoint" neighborhood is now located. Much of the area fronting the bay was naturally wooded, and here Deering created an arboretum and sanctuary for birds and animals. There were no public roadways in the area east of the railroad, and since Deering strongly opposed the opening of such streets, the area was preserved in its pristine, virgin state for many years.%0a%3c %0a%3c As the population of Miami grew between the late 1910s through the Boom era of the early 1920s, new areas reached northward along the old Dixie Highway (N.E. 2nd Avenue) and Avenue D (N. Miami Avenue), which was extended northward from N.E. 36th Street. The northern city limit of Miami was moved to N.E. 38th Street, and this took in a part of Buena Vista. Finally, on August 4, 1924, the new town of Buena Vista was incorporated and, together with the other incorporated areas of Coconut Grove and Silver Bluff, was annexed to the City of Miami the following year.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a%3c *%0a%3c *%0a%3c !!!!'''Average Resources''' â€¢â€¢%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Locations'''%0a%3c *Buena Vista East Historic District%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25''Morning Side''%0a%3c %0a%3c Started in the 1920s as "Bay Shore," it prospered in the mid-20th century and fell on hard times along with most of Miami's other inner city neighborhoods in the 60's and 70's. More recently Morningside was the first historic area in central Miami to experience gentrification with an influx of more-affluent residents. It has now been fully restored. The Morningside Historic District runs from NE 55th Street to NE 60th Street; it was the first historic district to be designated as such in the City of Miami. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992 as the Bay Shore Historic District.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Morningside Historic District is significant to the history of architecture, landscape architecture, and community development in Miami. Developed primarily between 1922 and 1941, Morningside contains a wealth of Mediterranean, Art Deco, and vernacular style houses that reflect the diversity and direction of architectural design during the 1920s and 1930s. Morningside is one of Miami's best planned subdivisions, featuring wide, tree-lined boulevards that contribute to the character of the area. This neighborhood was envisioned as an exclusive, residential community, and its amenities and location on Biscayne Bay attracted many influential and prominent local residents. One of Miami's most intact historic neighborhoods, Morningside is the City's best remaining example of a boom-era suburb.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Morningside Historic District stands today as one of Miami's most intact historic neighborhoods. Despite the number of post-1941 buildings in the area, Morningside retains a high degree of historic and architectural integrity. This is due, in part, to the fact that most later buildings are not intrusive, but respect the earlier structures in scale, setback, materials, and workmanship. The majority of neighborhood residents recognize the special character of the area and desire its continued preservation.%0a%3c %0a%3c As Miami's population expanded during the late 1920s and early 1920s, new subdivisions reached northward along Biscayne Bay. In 1922, a large, undeveloped bayfront tract near the northern city limits was platted. Called Bay Shore, this area was subdivided by the Bay Shore Investment Company and was the first of three phases that would be developed by the company between 1922 and 1924.Houses constructed in the Morningside Historic District reflect the eclecticism popular in the early twentieth century. The earlier buildings in the district are predominantly Mediterranean Revival in style, while structures built in the 1930s and early 1940s are frequently Art Deco. Outstanding examples of both styles are found here. Morningside also features a large number of masonry vernacular buildings that frequently utilize elements of several styles. An unusual Tudor Revival style house and one of the City's best examples of Mission style architecture add to the area's architectural diversity.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a%3c *%0a%3c *%0a%3c !!!!'''Average Resources''' â€¢â€¢â€¢%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Locations'''%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25''Bay Point''%25%25%0a%3c %0a%3c The Bayside Historic District reflects the formative years of the early 1900s through the mid-1940s. Once a part of the pioneer settlement of Lemon City, Bayside contains the oldest intact community in Northeast Miami, as well as one of this area's last remaining bayfront estates. From its onset, Bayside was the home of many prominent residents who played significant roles in the business life of both Lemon City and Miami.%0a%3c %0a%3c Bayside has four distinct subdivisions which were platted between 1909 and 1925, although the area itself was first settled in the late nineteenth century. These subdivisions include Elmira (N.E. 68th Street and N.E. 67th Street), which was platted in 1909; Acadia (N.E. 70th Street), which was platted in 1915; Baywood (N.E. 69th Street and the south side of N.E. 71st Street), which was platted in 1921 and added to in 1924; and Washington Place (N.E. 72nd Street and the north side of N.E. 71st Street), which was platted in 1925.%0a%3c %0a%3c In 1909, William B. and Fred C. Miller (not related) subdivided a seven-acre bayfront lot on today's N.E. 68th Street. The Millers had come to Florida in the late 1880s from Elmira, New York and had developed Elmira Farms near Arch Creek. Their new subdivision was named Elmira, and oolitic limestone gates announced the entrance to the new community.%0a%3c %0a%3c While much of what was Lemon City has been engulfed by later developments, Elmira has remained virtually intact. Although many of its houses have deteriorated, and newer buildings have been added, the street retains much of its early character. Elmira is characterized by its excellent collection of Frame Vernacular buildings, many of which were inspired by Northern architectural styles. The Elmira Club at 742 N.E. 68th Street, for example, has Dutch Colonial Revival influences, while other houses display classical details. The majority of houses were constructed in the 1910s.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Acadia subdivision was platted in 1915 by the Realty Securities Corporation and George E. Merrick. Although the subdivision evokes the memory of Longfellow with such names as Acadian Way, Evangeline Circle, Tropical Trail, and Druid Walk, the houses developed here are distinctly Mediterranean Revival in influence. This is due perhaps to the fact that only two houses were constructed prior to 1925. Development took off during the Boom years of the mid-1920s, however, when Wykoff and Estes Builders constructed an outstanding cluster of large, two-story Mediterranean Revival style houses near the eastern end of NE 70th Street.%0a%3c %0a%3c The last subdivision to be subdivided was Washington Place, which was also developed between 1925 and the mid-1940s. Samuel J. Prescott, who platted the subdivision in 1925, had constructed his own winter home at 7101 N.E. 10th Avenue some years before. The house remains today as one of the last intact bayfront estates in Northeast Miami. The estate once featured a recreational golf course for residents and guests. Prescott was founder of the firm of Samuel J. Prescott Co., Inc., building contractors, which developed several significant buildings in downtown Washington, D.C.

The project is a large-scale, urban development that was planned with 8 high-rise residential buildings, a hotel, two parks, and a major urban shopping area, "The Shops at Midtown". Due to the collapse of the real estate bubble in 2007, only two residential buildings, and about 2/3 of "The Shops at Midtown" were built. In July 2011, plans were announced to begin construction on a new entertainment center at Midtown, including a hotel, and shops on the site of the current temporary park in the center of Midtown. Critics of Midtown state the lack of parks as a major issue.%0a%3c %0a%3c Midtown has grown quickly, and is home to Shops at Midtown, an outdoor shopping area designed to mimic New York's SOHO neighborhood, and home to many national and local stores and restaurants including Target, Guess, HomeGoods, Marshalls, Sakaya Kitchen, Baru Urbano, Novecento & IT Lounge, Riviera Focacceria Italiana, Giraffas Brazilian Grill, Spris, Bar Louie, Wine Vault, 100 Montaditos, World of Beer, Chef Leon, Mercado Latino, My Ceviche, Five Guys Burgers & Fries, 4D Gelateria, Hurricane Grill & Wings, Lime Fresh Mexican Grill, Spun Candy, Pinkberry, SugarCane, Mercadito, Lagniappe, Sustain, Cheese Course, Buro Miami, Ring Finger Studio, and an abundance of upscale apartments. A fair amount of office businesses have also taken up residence in Midtown in office buildings, in industries ranging from interior decor to marketing agency services, and more. At Bï¿½ro Urbano urban workspace, office spaces are provided for small businesses. Midtown has also become home to Art Miami art fair, which takes place during Miami's Art Basel week.%0a%3c %0a%3c On 1 August 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a travel warning, advising pregnant women not to visit Midtown Miami, the Design District and Wynwood areas to avoid getting the Zika virus.

By 2007 Bacardi USA agreed to lease a complex in Coral Gables to use as its new headquarters. At that time, Bacardi had employees in seven buildings across South Florida. Bacardi vacated its former headquarters buildings. Miami citizens began a campaign to label the buildings as historic. Allan T. Schulman, a professor of architecture at the University of Miami, said "Miami's brand is its identity as a tropical city. The Bacardi buildings are exactly the sort that resonate with our consciousness of what Miami is about."  In 2007 Chad Oppenheim, the head of Oppenheim Architecture + Design, described the Bacardi buildings as "elegant, with a Modernist [look combined with] a local flavor."

Wynwood is best known for being a prominent entertainment district, dotted with artwork, restaurants, breweries, clothing stores, dance venues, among other retail options. Formerly an industrial district, the area is highlighted by colorful murals that cover the walls of many of the buildings. It is north of Downtown Miami and Overtown, and adjacent to Edgewater. Wynwood has two major sub-districts, the Wynwood Art District in northern Wynwood, and the Wynwood Fashion District along West 5th Avenue. Wynwood is roughly divided by North 20th Street to the south, I-195 to the north, I-95 to the west and the Florida East Coast Railway to the east.%0a%3c %0a%3c Wynwood was long referred to as "Little San Juan", and commonly known as "El Barrio" as many Puerto Ricans began immigrating to this Miami neighborhood from the island and northeastern cities in the 1950s. Puerto Rican-owned restaurants, shops, markets and other businesses line the streets of Wynwood. Since the early 2000s, the neighborhood has seen a rising amount of investments and attention, expanding the scope of the region. The Midtown Miami development construction began in 2005 between North 29th and 36th Street and Miami Avenue and the Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) on what was historically an FEC rail yard. This brought renewed attention to the area, and previously abandoned warehouses have begun to be occupied by artists, restaurants, cafï¿½s, and lounges. Tony Goldman, a developer, also assisted in the growth of Wynwood by creating a mecca out of the already present graffiti. In 2009, artists commissioned by Goldman helped create the Wynwood Walls. Located in the Wynwood Art District, this is an outdoor exhibition of rotating street art.%0a%3c Art district%0a%3c The Wynwood Art District is a sub-district of Wynwood that contains galleries, outdoor murals and private art collections.

The initial settlement of the Allapattah community began in 1856 when William P. Wagner, the earliest documented white American permanent settler, arrived from Charleston, South Carolina and established a homestead on a hammock along the Miami Rock Ridge, where Miami Jackson High School presently stands. Development ensued from 1896 and into the 20th century in the area with the completion of the Florida East Coast Railroad (FEC).%0a%3c %0a%3c Allapattah was predominantly populated by whites from early in the 20th century until the late 1950s, when there was a large influx of black Americans displaced by the construction of I-95 (then, the North-South Expressway) in the 1950s and 1960s, leading to white flight to suburban Miami-Dade County and Broward County. Cubans migrated to Miami neighborhoods like Allapattah in large numbers following the Cuban Revolution of 1959, hosting one of Miami's largest Cuban American populations. The 1980s brought influxes of Dominican Americans, Nicaraguans, Hondurans, and Haitians in the aftermath of various refugee crises in those nations.

These were the various enterprises in which the early pioneers were engaged and with the coming of the railroad and its stop at the Biscayne Station, they were able to live off the land. Two of the most successful growers were Major Hugh Gordon and T.V. Moore. T.V. Moore owned the land in what is today's commercial district, while the Gordon Tract bordered the bay. By 1922, Lee T. Cooper, who had amassed his wealth from a patent medicine by the name of Tanlac, purchased T.V. Moore's land holdings. Cooper planned to develop the area and named it Bay View Estates. In 1924, the Shoreland Company purchased the Gordon Tract, Bay View Estates and other scattered acreage in order to create Miami Shores, "America's Mediterranean."%0a> %0a> Hugh M. Anderson, president of the Shoreland Company, and its board of directors were experienced real estate developers. They previously completed the successful development of the Venetian Islands and they decided that their new project would be similar &#65533; residences of Italian inspired architecture within a landscape associated with water. The master development plan for Greater Miami Shores included 9,000 building sites, 5 2/3 miles of bay frontage, four miles of inland waterways and ten miles of main roadways. The plans also called for the construction of a causeway to Miami Beach, a golf course, a country club, a yacht club, a business district, apartment buildings, hotels, a school and churches, a railroad station and beautifying features such as parks, plazas and entryways.%0a> %0a> Early in 1926, it was reported that approximately 50 homes had been completed, another 50 were under construction, and an additional 100 were being planned. The commercial building program was in progress, sidewalks and roadways were being laid out and lighting and landscape work was well underway. Record setting sales and resales of property were being recorded. Unfortunately, on September 18, 1926, all plans for the community came to a halt with the arrival of a devastating hurricane. In addition, other factors contributed to the Shoreland Company's bankruptcy in 1927.%0a> %0a> The present Miami Shores roughly corresponds with the original "Biscayne" neighborhood of the City of Miami. With the arrival of the Great Depression, the City of Miami gave up its jurisdiction and the area incorporated under the name Miami Shores Village in 1932. Previously, part of the area that now comprises the City of North Miami had been known as Miami Shores. Under the leadership of Roy H. Hawkins, a request to grant a charter creating Miami Shores Village was presented in the State Legislature. On January 2, 1932, the Village became official at a council meeting. The charter named the following five members to the first council: Hugh H. Gordon, a banker whose father had owned the Gordon Tract; Frank O. Pruitt, who was in the insurance business; John M. Carlisle, president of the Eli Witt Cigar Company; W.F. Andes, a prominent dentist; and M.R. Harrison, a general contractor, who constructed much of Biscayne Boulevard. At this first meeting, Pruitt was elected mayor, and other appointments were made including Village Manager Miller Williams, Village Attorney George E. Holt, and a single policeman, Ed Badger.%0a> %0a> In the decades that followed its incorporation, growth was steady. A variety of architectural styles were introduced, yet the community emerged as the type of development the Shoreland Company envisioned. The community retains many of its original characteristics ï¿½ well situated and serviced by major highways, having tree-lined streets and wide roads, a downtown area, well-maintained homes provided with efficient services. and a variety of community activities.%0a> %0a> Today, Miami Shores is primarily a bedroom community for those working in Greater Miami, and has a sizeable retired population. The village is mostly single family residential homes, with very few multi-family units and only two small commercial areas along Northeast 2nd Avenue and Biscayne Boulevard.%0a> %0a> While it is frequently referred to as Miami Shores or the Village of Miami Shores, the municipality's official name under its charter is Miami Shores Village.%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a> %0a> %0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' â€¢â€¢â€¢%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Locations'''%0a> *Barry's University%0a> *Brockway Memorial Library%0a> *Miami Shores Country Club%0a> %0a> %0a> %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25''Little River''%25%25%0a> %0a> Little River is a neighborhood in Miami, Florida.

Once a part of the pioneer settlement of Lemon City, Bayside contains the oldest intact community in Northeast Miami, as well as one of this area's last remaining bayfront estates. From its onset, Bayside was the home of many prominent residents who played significant roles in the business life of both Lemon City and Miami.%0a> %0a> Bayside has four distinct subdivisions which were plated between 1909 and 1925, although the area itself was first settled in the late nineteenth century. These subdivisions include Elmira (N.E. 68th Street and N.E. 67th Street), which was platted in 1909; Acadia (N.E. 70th Street), which was platted in 1915; Baywood (N.E. 69th Street and the south side of N.E. 71st Street), which was platted in 1921 and added to in 1924; and Washington Place (N.E. 72nd Street and the north side of N.E. 71st Street), which was platted in 1925.%0a> %0a> In 1909, William B. and Fred C. Miller (not related) subdivided a seven-acre bayfront lot on today's N.E. 68th Street. The Millers had come to Florida in the late 1880s from Elmira, New York and had developed Elmira Farms near Arch Creek. Their new subdivision was named Elmira, and oolitic limestone gates announced the entrance to the new community.%0a> %0a> While much of what was Lemon City has been engulfed by later developments, Elmira has remained virtually intact. Although many of its houses have deteriorated, and newer buildings have been added, the street retains much of its early character. Elmira is characterized by its excellent collection of Frame Vernacular buildings, many of which were inspired by Northern architectural styles. The Elmira Club at 742 N.E. 68th Street, for example, has Dutch Colonial Revival influences, while other houses display classical details. The majority of houses were constructed in the 1910s.%0a> %0a> The Acadia subdivision was platted in 1915 by the Realty Securities Corporation and George E. Merrick. Although the subdivision evokes the memory of Longfellow with such names as Acadian Way, Evangeline Circle, Tropical Trail, and Druid Walk, the houses developed here are distinctly Mediterranean Revival in influence. This is due perhaps to the fact that only two houses were constructed prior to 1925. Development took off during the Boom years of the mid-1920s, however, when Wykoff and Estes Builders constructed an outstanding cluster of large, two-story Mediterranean Revival style houses near the eastern end of NE 70th Street.%0a> %0a> The last subdivision to be subdivided was Washington Place, which was also developed between 1925 and the mid-1940s. Samuel J. Prescott, who platted the subdivision in 1925, had constructed his own winter home at 7101 N.E. 10th Avenue some years before. The house remains today as one of the last intact bayfront estates in Northeast Miami. The estate once featured a recreational golf course for residents and guests. Prescott was the founder of the firm of Samuel J. Prescott Co., Inc., building contractors, which developed several significant buildings in downtown Washington, D.C. Prescott was chairman of the board of the Second National Bank of Washington, D.C., president of the Master Builders Association, the Builders and Manufacturers Exchange, and the Prescott Farms Company of New Hampshire.%0a> %0a> The Bayside Historic District remains today as an intact, cohesive neighborhood. Despite the number of post-1941 buildings, Bayside retains a high level of historic and architectural integrity.Houses constructed in Bayside reflect the diversity, direction, and taste of individual residents as well as the architectural eclecticism prevalent in the early-20th century. The earlier buildings in the district are Frame Vernacular, with several examples of early bungalows. Houses built in the 1920s are generally Mediterranean Revival in style, while structures built in the 1930s and 1940s are frequently Art Deco. Bayside also features a number of excellent examples of other architectural styles, including Mission Revival, Streamline Moderne, and Florida Ranch. Other structures, best described as Masonry Vernacular, add to the area's architectural diversity.%0a> %0a> %0a> !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a> *%0a> *%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' â€¢â€¢â€¢%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Locations'''%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> %0a> %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25''Lemon City(Little Haiti)''%25%25%0a> %0a> The area now known as Little Haiti was called Lemon City for well over a century. Several people settled near Biscayne Bay north of the Miami River after the civil war, squatting on unclaimed land. Some of the squatters eventually applied for homestead grants for the land they were squatting on. By 1889 a community had formed, with a post office named "Motto". "Lemon City" replaced "Motto" as the name of the community by 1893. A school had opened in 1890, and Lemon City also included several businesses and a newspaper, as well as port facilities on Biscayne Bay. With the extension of the Florida East Coast Railway to Miami in 1896, Miami quickly overshadowed Lemon City.%0a> %0a> %0a> Portrait of Father Gï¿½rard Jean-Juste on a gable wall by Serge Toussaint in Little Haiti.%0a> Viter Juste, a noted Haitian businessman, activist and respected community leader, came up with the name of Little Haiti. According to Jean-Claude Exulien, a retired professor of history and friend of Juste's since 1977, Juste wrote an article in the Miami Herald in which he first referred to the neighborhood as "Little Port-au-Prince." However, editors at the Miami Herald found the name, "Little Port-au-Prince," too long, so the newspaper shortened the term in the headline to Little Haiti. Over the objections of historians and African-Americans, Miami commissioners in May 2016 voted in favor of designating Little Haiti as an official neighborhood with boundaries overlapping the historic Lemon City, which was founded by Bahamian immigrants before Miami existed.%0a> %0a> %0a> !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a> *%0a> *%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' â€¢ to â€¢â€¢%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Locations'''%0a> *Little Haitiï¿½s main strip%0a> *The Little Haiti Community Garden%0a> *Athalie Range Park%0a> *Caribbean Marketplace%0a> %0a> %0a> %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25''Liberty City''%25%25%0a> %0a> Once a part of the sparsely populated outskirts of northern Miami, what became Liberty City developed during the Great Depression of the 1930s when President Franklin D.

Built as a response to the deteriorating housing conditions in densely populated and covenant-restricted slums of Overtown, construction on the initial housing project began in 1934 and opened in 1937.%0a> %0a> Into the 1940s and 1950s, the growing Liberty City and adjacent Brownsville thrived as a middle income black American community, hosting several churches, hospitals, and community centers. The area served as home to prominent figures such as Kelsey Pharr, M. Athalie Range (the first black American elected to serve on the Miami city commission) and boxer Muhammad Ali. Although segregation laws prohibited black Americans from resting and residing in popular Miami Beach, service establishment and resorts such as the Hampton House Motel and Villas catered to and entertained the likes of notables such as Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Althea Gibson, and even whites such as Mickey Mantle.%0a> %0a> Construction of Interstate 95 in Florida in Overtown and declining use of restrictive covenants in the wake of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 dramatically altered the neighborhood into the 1960s. Increasing numbers of lower income elderly and welfare-dependent families migrated to the Liberty City neighborhood following their displacement primarily from inner city Overtown, leading to large-scale black flight of middle and higher income blacks and other blacks like West Indian Americans largely to suburban areas like Florida City and Miami Gardens in southern and northern Dade County, respectively.%0a> %0a> Crime grew prevalent in the increasingly poverty-stricken area in the immediate postï¿½civil rights movement era of the 1960s and 1970s. The ensuing problems of the poor and disenfranchised grew most apparent and notable in race riots which occurred in Liberty City in August 1968 during the Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, and in 1980 following the acquittal of police officers charged with the killing of Arthur McDuffie.%0a> %0a> The plight of inner-city black Miamians increasingly came to be highlighted in national press into the 1980s as the Hurricanes football team of the University of Miami won several national college football championships led by players recruited from the mostly black, lower income neighborhoods such as Liberty City and Overtown. National exposure continued with the popularity of nationally broadcast programs such as the NBC crime drama Miami Vice, which brought the deteriorating conditions of the area to greater prominence.%0a> %0a> Into the 1990s and 2000s, the music grew to reflect the area with locals such as Luther Campbell of 2 Live Crew pioneering the Miami bass genre which dominated Southern hip hop music during the decade. Other music and sports talents rose to national prominence from the area such as rappers Trina and Trick Daddy and NFL players Chad "Ocho Cinco" Johnson, and Willis McGahee.%0a> %0a> %0a> !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a> *%0a> *%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' â€¢ to â€¢â€¢%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Locations'''%0a> *Miami Dade College%0a> *Model City Library%0a> *Sandrell Rivers Theater%0a> *Charles Hardley Park%0a> %0a> %0a> %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25''Buena Vista''%0a> %0a> In the 1890s, Buena Vista was a small village whose founding and growth paralleled Miami's. During the Land Boom of the 1920s, the area was developed as the Biltmore and Shadowlawn subdivisions. Originally home to many Florida cracker immigrants from Georgia and North Carolina, the neighborhood soon became popular with the owners of nearby businesses. The houses reflect their original owners' rising social status and include fine examples of Mediterranean Revival, Mission, Craftsman, and Art Deco architecture style residences.%0a> %0a> Buena Vista, Lemon City, and Little River were founded before the turn of the 19th-century and represent some of the earliest settlements in Miami-Dade County. The area known as Buena Vista was once a small village adjoining, but not within the corporate limits of Miami proper. Although preceded in age by pioneer Lemon City, a town located a little further north, the small village of Buena Vista dates its birth, development, and growth along with Miamiï¿½s. The founding of Buena Vista dates back to the days when the immense rock ridge extending between the Atlantic Ocean and the Florida Everglades was covered by a dense pine forest. The earliest history of the village is recorded in a survey made by government surveyors, and the locations of the land tracts are to this date still founded on this early document.%0a> The land which became Buena Vista was originally part of the homesteads of William Henry Gleason and E.L. White. Gleason, a prominent and somewhat notorious figure in early Miami-Dade County politics, arrived in Miami after the Civil War was elected Lieutenant Governor of Florida. He left the area in 1876 but retained his homestead for several years, eventually turning it over to his son. As early as 1892, E.L. White homesteaded the area from North 41st Street to 54th Street between West 2nd Avenue and East 2nd Avenue. This was the area from which the Biltmore and Shadowlawn Subdivisions, which today make up the "Buena Vista East Historic District", were carved in the early 1920s.%0a> %0a> The arrival of the railroad in 1896 marked the end of an era for the pioneer bayfront village of Lemon City, which had enjoyed tremendous importance to the Miami area by virtue of its docks. Now the train brought much needed supplies to the rest of Dade County, and lured people away from the bayfront community to Miami and its outlying areas. The Lemon City depot, built in 1896, drew business further west away from the bay, and the small village of Buena Vista gradually developed. One of the earliest subdivisions in the Buena Vista areas was the Buena Vista Biscayne Badger Club Subdivision, which was developed in 1910 as a bayfront community with a private water plant, streets, and a park with recreation dock on the bay. However, it was inland where the village took shape. By 1910, suburban Buena Vista could boast of one hotel known as the Courley House, its very own railroad depot on the Florida East Coast Railway line, a small post office building, tropical fruit groves, a fruit-packing house, a grocery store, and one religious institution, the Holy Cross Episcopal Church.%0a> %0a> Other prominent citizens acquired land in Buena Vista. Among them was the millionaire, Charles Deering, who purchased a large tract of bayfront land east of the railroad, in the area now known as the Upper Eastside. This land is where the "Baypoint" neighborhood is now located. Much of the area fronting the bay was naturally wooded, and here Deering created an arboretum and sanctuary for birds and animals. There were no public roadways in the area east of the railroad, and since Deering strongly opposed the opening of such streets, the area was preserved in its pristine, virgin state for many years.%0a> %0a> As the population of Miami grew between the late 1910s through the Boom era of the early 1920s, new areas reached northward along the old Dixie Highway (N.E. 2nd Avenue) and Avenue D (N. Miami Avenue), which was extended northward from N.E. 36th Street. The northern city limit of Miami was moved to N.E. 38th Street, and this took in a part of Buena Vista. Finally, on August 4, 1924, the new town of Buena Vista was incorporated and, together with the other incorporated areas of Coconut Grove and Silver Bluff, was annexed to the City of Miami the following year.%0a> %0a> %0a> !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a> *%0a> *%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' â€¢â€¢%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Locations'''%0a> *Buena Vista East Historic District%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> %0a> %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25''Morning Side''%0a> %0a> Started in the 1920s as "Bay Shore," it prospered in the mid-20th century and fell on hard times along with most of Miami's other inner city neighborhoods in the 60's and 70's. More recently Morningside was the first historic area in central Miami to experience gentrification with an influx of more-affluent residents. It has now been fully restored. The Morningside Historic District runs from NE 55th Street to NE 60th Street; it was the first historic district to be designated as such in the City of Miami. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992 as the Bay Shore Historic District.%0a> %0a> The Morningside Historic District is significant to the history of architecture, landscape architecture, and community development in Miami. Developed primarily between 1922 and 1941, Morningside contains a wealth of Mediterranean, Art Deco, and vernacular style houses that reflect the diversity and direction of architectural design during the 1920s and 1930s. Morningside is one of Miami's best planned subdivisions, featuring wide, tree-lined boulevards that contribute to the character of the area. This neighborhood was envisioned as an exclusive, residential community, and its amenities and location on Biscayne Bay attracted many influential and prominent local residents. One of Miami's most intact historic neighborhoods, Morningside is the City's best remaining example of a boom-era suburb.%0a> %0a> The Morningside Historic District stands today as one of Miami's most intact historic neighborhoods. Despite the number of post-1941 buildings in the area, Morningside retains a high degree of historic and architectural integrity. This is due, in part, to the fact that most later buildings are not intrusive, but respect the earlier structures in scale, setback, materials, and workmanship. The majority of neighborhood residents recognize the special character of the area and desire its continued preservation.%0a> %0a> As Miami's population expanded during the late 1920s and early 1920s, new subdivisions reached northward along Biscayne Bay. In 1922, a large, undeveloped bayfront tract near the northern city limits was platted. Called Bay Shore, this area was subdivided by the Bay Shore Investment Company and was the first of three phases that would be developed by the company between 1922 and 1924.Houses constructed in the Morningside Historic District reflect the eclecticism popular in the early twentieth century. The earlier buildings in the district are predominantly Mediterranean Revival in style, while structures built in the 1930s and early 1940s are frequently Art Deco. Outstanding examples of both styles are found here. Morningside also features a large number of masonry vernacular buildings that frequently utilize elements of several styles. An unusual Tudor Revival style house and one of the City's best examples of Mission style architecture add to the area's architectural diversity.%0a> %0a> %0a> !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a> *%0a> *%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' â€¢â€¢â€¢%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Locations'''%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> %0a> %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25''Bay Point''%25%25%0a> %0a> The Bayside Historic District reflects the formative years of the early 1900s through the mid-1940s. Once a part of the pioneer settlement of Lemon City, Bayside contains the oldest intact community in Northeast Miami, as well as one of this area's last remaining bayfront estates. From its onset, Bayside was the home of many prominent residents who played significant roles in the business life of both Lemon City and Miami.%0a> %0a> Bayside has four distinct subdivisions which were platted between 1909 and 1925, although the area itself was first settled in the late nineteenth century. These subdivisions include Elmira (N.E. 68th Street and N.E. 67th Street), which was platted in 1909; Acadia (N.E. 70th Street), which was platted in 1915; Baywood (N.E. 69th Street and the south side of N.E. 71st Street), which was platted in 1921 and added to in 1924; and Washington Place (N.E. 72nd Street and the north side of N.E. 71st Street), which was platted in 1925.%0a> %0a> In 1909, William B. and Fred C. Miller (not related) subdivided a seven-acre bayfront lot on today's N.E. 68th Street. The Millers had come to Florida in the late 1880s from Elmira, New York and had developed Elmira Farms near Arch Creek. Their new subdivision was named Elmira, and oolitic limestone gates announced the entrance to the new community.%0a> %0a> While much of what was Lemon City has been engulfed by later developments, Elmira has remained virtually intact. Although many of its houses have deteriorated, and newer buildings have been added, the street retains much of its early character. Elmira is characterized by its excellent collection of Frame Vernacular buildings, many of which were inspired by Northern architectural styles. The Elmira Club at 742 N.E. 68th Street, for example, has Dutch Colonial Revival influences, while other houses display classical details. The majority of houses were constructed in the 1910s.%0a> %0a> The Acadia subdivision was platted in 1915 by the Realty Securities Corporation and George E. Merrick. Although the subdivision evokes the memory of Longfellow with such names as Acadian Way, Evangeline Circle, Tropical Trail, and Druid Walk, the houses developed here are distinctly Mediterranean Revival in influence. This is due perhaps to the fact that only two houses were constructed prior to 1925. Development took off during the Boom years of the mid-1920s, however, when Wykoff and Estes Builders constructed an outstanding cluster of large, two-story Mediterranean Revival style houses near the eastern end of NE 70th Street.%0a> %0a> The last subdivision to be subdivided was Washington Place, which was also developed between 1925 and the mid-1940s. Samuel J. Prescott, who platted the subdivision in 1925, had constructed his own winter home at 7101 N.E. 10th Avenue some years before. The house remains today as one of the last intact bayfront estates in Northeast Miami. The estate once featured a recreational golf course for residents and guests. Prescott was founder of the firm of Samuel J. Prescott Co., Inc., building contractors, which developed several significant buildings in downtown Washington, D.C. Prescott was chairman of the board of the Second National Bank of Washington, D.C., president of the Master Builders Association, the Builders and Manufacturers Exchange, and the Prescott Farms Company of New Hampshire.%0a> %0a> The Bayside Historic District remains today as an intact, cohesive neighborhood. Despite the number of post-1941 buildings, Bayside retains a high level of historic and architectural integrity.%0a> Houses constructed in Bayside reflect the diversity, direction, and taste of individual residents as well as the architectural eclecticism prevalent in the early-20th century. The earlier buildings in the district are Frame Vernacular, with several examples of early bungalows. Houses built in the 1920s are generally Mediterranean Revival in style, while structures built in the 1930s and 1940s are frequently Art Deco. Bayside also features a number of excellent examples of other architectural styles, including Mission Revival, Streamline Moderne, and Florida Ranch. Other structures, best described as Masonry Vernacular, add to the area's architectural diversity.%0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a> *%0a> *%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' â€¢â€¢â€¢%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Locations'''%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> %0a> %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25''Midtown''%25%25%0a> %0a> Midtown Miami is the collective term for the Wynwood and Edgewater neighborhoods of Miami, Florida, United States, north of Downtown and south of the Miami Design District. It is roughly bound by North 20th Street to the south, I-195 to the north, I-95 to the west and Biscayne Bay to the east.%0a> %0a> In 2005, construction began on the "Midtown Miami" development between North 29th and 36th Street and Miami Avenue and the Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) on what was historically an FEC rail yard. The project is a large-scale, urban development that was planned with 8 high-rise residential buildings, a hotel, two parks, and a major urban shopping area, "The Shops at Midtown". Due to the collapse of the real estate bubble in 2007, only two residential buildings, and about 2/3 of "The Shops at Midtown" were built. In July 2011, plans were announced to begin construction on a new entertainment center at Midtown, including a hotel, and shops on the site of the current temporary park in the center of Midtown. Critics of Midtown state the lack of parks as a major issue.%0a> %0a> Midtown has grown quickly, and is home to Shops at Midtown, an outdoor shopping area designed to mimic New York's SOHO neighborhood, and home to many national and local stores and restaurants including Target, Guess, HomeGoods, Marshalls, Sakaya Kitchen, Baru Urbano, Novecento & IT Lounge, Riviera Focacceria Italiana, Giraffas Brazilian Grill, Spris, Bar Louie, Wine Vault, 100 Montaditos, World of Beer, Chef Leon, Mercado Latino, My Ceviche, Five Guys Burgers & Fries, 4D Gelateria, Hurricane Grill & Wings, Lime Fresh Mexican Grill, Spun Candy, Pinkberry, SugarCane, Mercadito, Lagniappe, Sustain, Cheese Course, Buro Miami, Ring Finger Studio, and an abundance of upscale apartments. A fair amount of office businesses have also taken up residence in Midtown in office buildings, in industries ranging from interior decor to marketing agency services, and more. At Bï¿½ro Urbano urban workspace, office spaces are provided for small businesses. Midtown has also become home to Art Miami art fair, which takes place during Miami's Art Basel week.%0a> %0a> On 1 August 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a travel warning, advising pregnant women not to visit Midtown Miami, the Design District and Wynwood areas to avoid getting the Zika virus. Zika warnings in Miami have been lifted by the end of 2016%0a> %0a> Bacardi's United States headquarters were located in the Bacardi buildings also near Midtown Miami. By 2007 Bacardi USA agreed to lease a complex in Coral Gables to use as its new headquarters. At that time, Bacardi had employees in seven buildings across South Florida. Bacardi vacated its former headquarters buildings. Miami citizens began a campaign to label the buildings as historic. Allan T. Schulman, a professor of architecture at the University of Miami, said "Miami's brand is its identity as a tropical city. The Bacardi buildings are exactly the sort that resonate with our consciousness of what Miami is about."  In 2007 Chad Oppenheim, the head of Oppenheim Architecture + Design, described the Bacardi buildings as "elegant, with a Modernist [look combined with] a local flavor." In late 2012, the National YoungArts Foundation purchased the storied Bacardi buildings and converted them into their national headquarters%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a> *%0a> *%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Locations'''%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> %0a> %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25''Design District''%25%25%0a> %0a> The Miami Design District is a neighborhood in Miami, Florida, United States and a shopping, dining and cultural destination.

Wynwood is best known for being a prominent entertainment district, dotted with artwork, restaurants, breweries, clothing stores, dance venues, among other retail options. Formerly an industrial district, the area is highlighted by colorful murals that cover the walls of many of the buildings. It is north of Downtown Miami and Overtown, and adjacent to Edgewater. Wynwood has two major sub-districts, the Wynwood Art District in northern Wynwood, and the Wynwood Fashion District along West 5th Avenue. Wynwood is roughly divided by North 20th Street to the south, I-195 to the north, I-95 to the west and the Florida East Coast Railway to the east.%0a> %0a> Wynwood was long referred to as "Little San Juan", and commonly known as "El Barrio" as many Puerto Ricans began immigrating to this Miami neighborhood from the island and northeastern cities in the 1950s. Puerto Rican-owned restaurants, shops, markets and other businesses line the streets of Wynwood. Since the early 2000s, the neighborhood has seen a rising amount of investments and attention, expanding the scope of the region. The Midtown Miami development construction began in 2005 between North 29th and 36th Street and Miami Avenue and the Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) on what was historically an FEC rail yard. This brought renewed attention to the area, and previously abandoned warehouses have begun to be occupied by artists, restaurants, cafï¿½s, and lounges. Tony Goldman, a developer, also assisted in the growth of Wynwood by creating a mecca out of the already present graffiti. In 2009, artists commissioned by Goldman helped create the Wynwood Walls. Located in the Wynwood Art District, this is an outdoor exhibition of rotating street art.%0a> Art district%0a> The Wynwood Art District is a sub-district of Wynwood that contains galleries, outdoor murals and private art collections. The district is centered around Wynwood Walls, conceived of by the late urban developer Tony Goldman in 2009. His idea was to revitalize the neighborhood by turning warehouses into works of art.

As of May 2011, the county-owned portion of Allapattah, from State Road 9 to LeJeune Road, is being annexed by the city proper.%0a> %0a> A stretch in the neighborhood along NW 17th Avenue was nicknamed Little Santo Domingo in 2003, in an effort spurred by former Miami mayor and longtime city commissioner Wilfredo "Willy" Gort to honor the sizable Dominican American population in the community%0a> %0a> The name is derived from the Seminole Indian language word meaning alligator. The initial settlement of the Allapattah community began in 1856 when William P. Wagner, the earliest documented white American permanent settler, arrived from Charleston, South Carolina and established a homestead on a hammock along the Miami Rock Ridge, where Miami Jackson High School presently stands. Development ensued from 1896 and into the 20th century in the area with the completion of the Florida East Coast Railroad (FEC).%0a> %0a> Allapattah was predominantly populated by whites from early in the 20th century until the late 1950s, when there was a large influx of black Americans displaced by the construction of I-95 (then, the North-South Expressway) in the 1950s and 1960s, leading to white flight to suburban Miami-Dade County and Broward County. Cubans migrated to Miami neighborhoods like Allapattah in large numbers following the Cuban Revolution of 1959, hosting one of Miami's largest Cuban American populations. The 1980s brought influxes of Dominican Americans, Nicaraguans, Hondurans, and Haitians in the aftermath of various refugee crises in those nations. Now, a melting pot of residents from all across the Caribbean, Central America, and Latin America reside in the area.%0a> %0a> A thriving textiles market is located along Northwest 20th Street between Northwest 17th and 27th Avenues, with several garment manufacturing and wholesale outlets from Latin America and the Caribbean makers along the row. The Produce Market, the largest open-air food distribution center in Miami, serves local supermarkets and bodegas with the freshest variety of South Florida produce, tropical fruits and many other products.%0a> %0a> The industrial district of the city of Miami is located in an area straddling the Civic Center and Allapattah, along a former FEC corridor just north of Northwest 20th Street. Trades ranging from clothing manufacturers, auto repair, carpentry and upholstery shops.

It was created in 1959 to mark Oregon&#2013266066;s centennial and was recognized as a &#2013266067;well-crafted example of roadside architecture&#2013266068; according to the National Register of Historical Places. The Paul Bunyan statue is Oregon&#2013266066;s only roadside architecture in the register. Located just off I-5 when coming into town (and just across from the Kenton/N. Denver Avenue MAX station when already there), Paul is super easy to find.   He stands watch over a busy intersection and is one of many things that helps to &#2013266067;keep Portland weird.&#2013266068;%0a> %0a> The statue was commissioned by the Kenton Businessman&#2013266066;s Club to greet the millions of visitors to the Centennial Exposition, set up at the current-day Expo Center in North Portland at a time when Interstate Avenue was the main gateway to Portland.%0a> %0a> Many people regard the neighborhoods of North Portland as the area of opportunity.

It includes the Portland International Raceway, the University of Portland, and massive cargo facilities of the Port of Portland. Slang-names for it include &#2013266067;NoPo&#2013266068; (shortened from North Portland) and &#2013266067;the Fifth Quadrant&#2013266068; (for being the odd-man out from the four-cornered logic of SE, NE, SW, and NW).%0a> %0a> North Portland is connected to the industrial area of Northwest Portland by the St. Johns Bridge, a 2,067 foot long suspension bridge completed in 1931 and extensively rehabilitated in 2003-05.%0a> %0a> During World War II, a planned development named Vanport was constructed to the north of this section between the city limits and the Columbia River. It grew to be the second largest city in Oregon, but was wiped out by a disastrous flood in 1948. Columbia Villa, another wartime housing project in the Portsmouth Neighborhood, was rebuilt; the renewed community opened in 2005 is known as New Columbia and offers public housing, rental housing, and single family home ownership units.  Crime in downtown Portland gets a lot of media attention. Police arrested two suspects in connection with a 43-year-old man who was fatally stabbed downtown the week before.  The tiny Eliot Neighborhood in North Portland,  with its 3,611 people in 560 acres, which has a part-one rate of 1.86 crimes per person.

These were the various enterprises in which the early pioneers were engaged and with the coming of the railroad and its stop at the Biscayne Station, they were able to live off the land. Two of the most successful growers were Major Hugh Gordon and T.V. Moore. T.V. Moore owned the land in what is today's commercial district, while the Gordon Tract bordered the bay. By 1922, Lee T. Cooper, who had amassed his wealth from a patent medicine by the name of Tanlac, purchased T.V. Moore's land holdings. Cooper planned to develop the area and named it Bay View Estates. In 1924, the Shoreland Company purchased the Gordon Tract, Bay View Estates and other scattered acreage in order to create Miami Shores, "America's Mediterranean."%0a%3c %0a%3c Hugh M. Anderson, president of the Shoreland Company, and its board of directors were experienced real estate developers. They previously completed the successful development of the Venetian Islands and they decided that their new project would be similar – residences of Italian inspired architecture within a landscape associated with water. The master development plan for Greater Miami Shores included 9,000 building sites, 5 2/3 miles of bay frontage, four miles of inland waterways and ten miles of main roadways. The plans also called for the construction of a causeway to Miami Beach, a golf course, a country club, a yacht club, a business district, apartment buildings, hotels, a school and churches, a railroad station and beautifying features such as parks, plazas and entryways.%0a%3c %0a%3c Early in 1926, it was reported that approximately 50 homes had been completed, another 50 were under construction, and an additional 100 were being planned. The commercial building program was in progress, sidewalks and roadways were being laid out and lighting and landscape work was well underway. Record setting sales and resales of property were being recorded. Unfortunately, on September 18, 1926, all plans for the community came to a halt with the arrival of a devastating hurricane. In addition, other factors contributed to the Shoreland Company's bankruptcy in 1927.%0a%3c %0a%3c The present Miami Shores roughly corresponds with the original "Biscayne" neighborhood of the City of Miami. With the arrival of the Great Depression, the City of Miami gave up its jurisdiction and the area incorporated under the name Miami Shores Village in 1932. Previously, part of the area that now comprises the City of North Miami had been known as Miami Shores. Under the leadership of Roy H. Hawkins, a request to grant a charter creating Miami Shores Village was presented in the State Legislature. On January 2, 1932, the Village became official at a council meeting. The charter named the following five members to the first council: Hugh H. Gordon, a banker whose father had owned the Gordon Tract; Frank O. Pruitt, who was in the insurance business; John M. Carlisle, president of the Eli Witt Cigar Company; W.F. Andes, a prominent dentist; and M.R. Harrison, a general contractor, who constructed much of Biscayne Boulevard. At this first meeting, Pruitt was elected mayor, and other appointments were made including Village Manager Miller Williams, Village Attorney George E. Holt, and a single policeman, Ed Badger.%0a%3c %0a%3c In the decades that followed its incorporation, growth was steady. A variety of architectural styles were introduced, yet the community emerged as the type of development the Shoreland Company envisioned. The community retains many of its original characteristics – well situated and serviced by major highways, having tree-lined streets and wide roads, a downtown area, well-maintained homes provided with efficient services. and a variety of community activities.%0a%3c %0a%3c Today, Miami Shores is primarily a bedroom community for those working in Greater Miami, and has a sizeable retired population. The village is mostly single family residential homes, with very few multi-family units and only two small commercial areas along Northeast 2nd Avenue and Biscayne Boulevard.%0a%3c %0a%3c While it is frequently referred to as Miami Shores or the Village of Miami Shores, the municipality's official name under its charter is Miami Shores Village.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!%25center%25''Arbor Lodge''%0a> %0a> As a result of the Portland real estate market boom and several key area improvements benefiting the neighborhood, Arbor Lodge has evolved a great deal over the last many years.  New to the area over the last decade and greatly improving the lives of its residents are the Max light rail line located on Interstate, New Seasons Market, a vastly improved and remodeled Fred Meyer and a lot of new life in the area in terms of independent businesses such as restaurants, boutiques, bike shops and of course, coffee shops. Just five minutes from downtown Portland, Arbor Lodge offers convenient, easy access to other popular N and NE Portland neighborhoods. If you enjoy the euro-urbanite lifestyle of bicycling, walking and neighborhood owned coffee and grocery shops, Arbor Lodge might be the perfect fit for you.%0a> %0a> Arbor Lodge homes run the gamut of 20th century architecture, from classic Bungalow, to Old Portland, to Cape Cod and more. A drive through the neighborhood streets reveals quiet streets and modest homes. The area is restoration focused and community minded.  Dynamic. Community conscious. Prolific growth. A good mix of young families, singles, and local old-timers who care about one another and the community. Neighbors bond and look out for one another. Block parties, dog walkers, joggers, bicyclists, feet hitting pavement and babes in strollers are Arbor Lodge staples.

Bridgeton residents, while in Oregon, are located just about halfway between Portland and Vancouver, Washington making dining and shopping that much more varied in terms of options. Commuting to both cities is quick and easy during off hours but northbound traffic on I-5 is often bottlenecked during rush hour.%0a> %0a> Some issues concerning the Bridgeton community include care of the environment, water safety, traffic and noise control, and the proposed Columbia River Crossing project .  "The Columbia River Crossing project is aimed at improving the mobility, reliability, and accessibility for automobile, freight, transit, bicycle, and pedestrian users of the I-5 corridor from State Route 500 in Vancouver to approximately Columbia Boulevard in Portland. Through an inclusive, collaborative process, this project will deliver a financially feasible solution that strengthens the regional economy and strives to support community livability." %0a> %0a> To get a local's view of Bridgeton, be sure to check out the Bridgeton Blog, and the Bridgeton neighborhood association website at BridgetonPdx.com%0a> %0a> The Max light rail train is easily accessed by local residents and the I-5 freeway is also very close and convenient. Bridgeton is located in very close proximity to the Portland International Airport just a few minutes drive east off Marine Drive.

You might see people feeding the ducks, or greeting the other feathered friends who share the neighborhood, like "Gus", the local goose.  Bridgeton homes are varied from traditional residential homes, house boats and floating homes, townhomes, condos and some upscale apartment homes. While Bridgeton's lifestyle seems miles away from the urban living in Downtown Portland, Bridgeton is only about a 15 minute drive to Downtown along I-5, and a similar short distance from the Portland International Airport. There's a ton of local shopping nearby at Jantzen Beach shopping center.

Once a part of the pioneer settlement of Lemon City, Bayside contains the oldest intact community in Northeast Miami, as well as one of this area's last remaining bayfront estates. From its onset, Bayside was the home of many prominent residents who played significant roles in the business life of both Lemon City and Miami.%0a%3c %0a%3c Bayside has four distinct subdivisions which were plated between 1909 and 1925, although the area itself was first settled in the late nineteenth century. These subdivisions include Elmira (N.E. 68th Street and N.E. 67th Street), which was platted in 1909; Acadia (N.E. 70th Street), which was platted in 1915; Baywood (N.E. 69th Street and the south side of N.E. 71st Street), which was platted in 1921 and added to in 1924; and Washington Place (N.E. 72nd Street and the north side of N.E. 71st Street), which was platted in 1925.%0a%3c %0a%3c In 1909, William B. and Fred C. Miller (not related) subdivided a seven-acre bayfront lot on today's N.E. 68th Street. The Millers had come to Florida in the late 1880s from Elmira, New York and had developed Elmira Farms near Arch Creek. Their new subdivision was named Elmira, and oolitic limestone gates announced the entrance to the new community.%0a%3c %0a%3c While much of what was Lemon City has been engulfed by later developments, Elmira has remained virtually intact. Although many of its houses have deteriorated, and newer buildings have been added, the street retains much of its early character. Elmira is characterized by its excellent collection of Frame Vernacular buildings, many of which were inspired by Northern architectural styles. The Elmira Club at 742 N.E. 68th Street, for example, has Dutch Colonial Revival influences, while other houses display classical details. The majority of houses were constructed in the 1910s.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Acadia subdivision was platted in 1915 by the Realty Securities Corporation and George E. Merrick. Although the subdivision evokes the memory of Longfellow with such names as Acadian Way, Evangeline Circle, Tropical Trail, and Druid Walk, the houses developed here are distinctly Mediterranean Revival in influence. This is due perhaps to the fact that only two houses were constructed prior to 1925. Development took off during the Boom years of the mid-1920s, however, when Wykoff and Estes Builders constructed an outstanding cluster of large, two-story Mediterranean Revival style houses near the eastern end of NE 70th Street.%0a%3c %0a%3c The last subdivision to be subdivided was Washington Place, which was also developed between 1925 and the mid-1940s. Samuel J. Prescott, who platted the subdivision in 1925, had constructed his own winter home at 7101 N.E. 10th Avenue some years before. The house remains today as one of the last intact bayfront estates in Northeast Miami. The estate once featured a recreational golf course for residents and guests. Prescott was the founder of the firm of Samuel J. Prescott Co., Inc., building contractors, which developed several significant buildings in downtown Washington, D.C. Prescott was chairman of the board of the Second National Bank of Washington, D.C., president of the Master Builders Association, the Builders and Manufacturers Exchange, and the Prescott Farms Company of New Hampshire.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Bayside Historic District remains today as an intact, cohesive neighborhood. Despite the number of post-1941 buildings, Bayside retains a high level of historic and architectural integrity.Houses constructed in Bayside reflect the diversity, direction, and taste of individual residents as well as the architectural eclecticism prevalent in the early-20th century. The earlier buildings in the district are Frame Vernacular, with several examples of early bungalows. Houses built in the 1920s are generally Mediterranean Revival in style, while structures built in the 1930s and 1940s are frequently Art Deco. Bayside also features a number of excellent examples of other architectural styles, including Mission Revival, Streamline Moderne, and Florida Ranch. Other structures, best described as Masonry Vernacular, add to the area's architectural diversity.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Hayden Island''%25%25%0a> %0a> Hayden Island is located in North Portland.

Some of the squatters eventually applied for homestead grants for the land they were squatting on. By 1889 a community had formed, with a post office named "Motto". "Lemon City" replaced "Motto" as the name of the community by 1893. A school had opened in 1890, and Lemon City also included several businesses and a newspaper, as well as port facilities on Biscayne Bay. With the extension of the Florida East Coast Railway to Miami in 1896, Miami quickly overshadowed Lemon City.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Portrait of Father Gérard Jean-Juste on a gable wall by Serge Toussaint in Little Haiti.%0a%3c Viter Juste, a noted Haitian businessman, activist and respected community leader, came up with the name of Little Haiti. According to Jean-Claude Exulien, a retired professor of history and friend of Juste's since 1977, Juste wrote an article in the Miami Herald in which he first referred to the neighborhood as "Little Port-au-Prince." However, editors at the Miami Herald found the name, "Little Port-au-Prince," too long, so the newspaper shortened the term in the headline to Little Haiti. Over the objections of historians and African-Americans, Miami commissioners in May 2016 voted in favor of designating Little Haiti as an official neighborhood with boundaries overlapping the historic Lemon City, which was founded by Bahamian immigrants before Miami existed.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!%25center%25%25werewolf%25''Kenton''%25%25%0a> %0a> The Kenton neighborhood is located in North Portland and is bordered by Arbor Lodge, St. Johns, and Piedmont neighborhoods. Kenton is also in close proximity to other popular neighborhoods via the Max light rail which is located on nearby Interstate Avenue. A drive to downtown Portland is a mere 7-8 minutes away in good traffic conditions and a bike ride is about 25 minutes and is in mostly designated bike lanes.  Like many of the surrounding Portland neighborhoods, Kenton has been evolving but on a slower scale. The streets have new life and many of the vacant buildings have been rented and great local businesses have emerged. Locals enjoy indie businesses such as Posie's Coffee, The Kenton Pub, Pizza Fino, E-San Thai, The Cup and Saucer Cafe and their very own library. %0a> %0a> Kenton has some wonderful areas with beautifully improved homes and streets yet some are still in transition. Denver is the main drag and feels like the downtown in a very tiny city.   Evolving. On the cusp of something special...something fantastic. Neighborhood locals are extremely down-home, very approachable. Walking through the commercial district of Kenton will spark entrepreneurial thoughts of opening your own cute store front. For those of you that remember Mississippi Ave before it was a hip, thriving district, you'll know that just a decade ago, the area was basically abandoned and largely unsafe. All it took was a few brave entrepreneurs to come in and begin to fill the void.%0a> We predict that Kenton is one of the next up and coming neighborhood in North Portland.  Kenton is comprised of mostly modest homes with architectural styles such as Portland's Craftsman style Bungalow, Cottages, Old Portland, Victorian, Foursquare and other mid-sized, one and two story homes.%0a> %0a> There are some amazing old homes in Kenton, especially on Denver Avenue, which is the start of the commercial district. True to Portland style, this neighborhood will reveal creative paint schemes, innovative landscaping, and attention-to-detail restoration efforts. This lovely neighborhood is truly a gem given some still affordable home prices and a neighborhood community that truly cares about the growth and overall livability of the area.%0a> %0a154a139%0a> *%25werewolf%25[[http://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/Players/Aegis|Werewolves - Aegis]]%25%25%0a156,158c141,142%0a%3c *%0a%3c !!!!'''Average Resources''' • to ••%0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a> %0a160,165c144,147%0a%3c *Little Haiti’s main strip%0a%3c *The Little Haiti Community Garden%0a%3c *Athalie Range Park%0a%3c *Caribbean Marketplace%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> *%25werewolf%25[[https://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/City/KentonFitnessClub|Kenton Fitness Club]]%25%25%0a> *%25werewolf%25[[Players.AegisPackhouse|Aegis Packhouse]]%0a> *Link%0a> %0a168,182c150,157%0a%3c !!%25center%25''Liberty City''%25%25%0a%3c %0a%3c Once a part of the sparsely populated outskirts of northern Miami, what became Liberty City developed during the Great Depression of the 1930s when President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized the construction of the Liberty Square housing project in 1933, the first of its kind in the Southern United States. Built as a response to the deteriorating housing conditions in densely populated and covenant-restricted slums of Overtown, construction on the initial housing project began in 1934 and opened in 1937.%0a%3c %0a%3c Into the 1940s and 1950s, the growing Liberty City and adjacent Brownsville thrived as a middle income black American community, hosting several churches, hospitals, and community centers. The area served as home to prominent figures such as Kelsey Pharr, M. Athalie Range (the first black American elected to serve on the Miami city commission) and boxer Muhammad Ali. Although segregation laws prohibited black Americans from resting and residing in popular Miami Beach, service establishment and resorts such as the Hampton House Motel and Villas catered to and entertained the likes of notables such as Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Althea Gibson, and even whites such as Mickey Mantle.%0a%3c %0a%3c Construction of Interstate 95 in Florida in Overtown and declining use of restrictive covenants in the wake of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 dramatically altered the neighborhood into the 1960s. Increasing numbers of lower income elderly and welfare-dependent families migrated to the Liberty City neighborhood following their displacement primarily from inner city Overtown, leading to large-scale black flight of middle and higher income blacks and other blacks like West Indian Americans largely to suburban areas like Florida City and Miami Gardens in southern and northern Dade County, respectively.%0a%3c %0a%3c Crime grew prevalent in the increasingly poverty-stricken area in the immediate post–civil rights movement era of the 1960s and 1970s. The ensuing problems of the poor and disenfranchised grew most apparent and notable in race riots which occurred in Liberty City in August 1968 during the Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, and in 1980 following the acquittal of police officers charged with the killing of Arthur McDuffie.%0a%3c %0a%3c The plight of inner-city black Miamians increasingly came to be highlighted in national press into the 1980s as the Hurricanes football team of the University of Miami won several national college football championships led by players recruited from the mostly black, lower income neighborhoods such as Liberty City and Overtown. National exposure continued with the popularity of nationally broadcast programs such as the NBC crime drama Miami Vice, which brought the deteriorating conditions of the area to greater prominence.%0a%3c %0a%3c Into the 1990s and 2000s, the music grew to reflect the area with locals such as Luther Campbell of 2 Live Crew pioneering the Miami bass genre which dominated Southern hip hop music during the decade. Other music and sports talents rose to national prominence from the area such as rappers Trina and Trick Daddy and NFL players Chad "Ocho Cinco" Johnson, and Willis McGahee.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!%25center%25%25vampire%25''Overlook''%25%25%0a> %0a> Overlook is located in North Portland and is bordered by the popular University Park, Arbor Lodge, Humboldt, Boise, and Eliot neighborhoods.  Overlook also includes what is known as Swan Island, a mostly industrial area with an active recreational boat launch and port.  As a result of the Portland real estate market boom and like many other Portland neighborhoods, Overlook has seen an influx of new residents to the area. As one might imagine, Overlook has some wonderful areas with beautifully improved homes and neighborhoods and some still in transition. %0a> %0a> This area feels a bit secluded as it is on the "other side" of Interstate Avenue but offers convenient access to other local neighborhoods, and the Max light rail train.  Local businesses thrive here- a few standouts are the wacky and ever popular Alibi bar, Pause, Miho Izakaya, Beaterville, Fire on the Mountain, The Overlook House and Dip Rima Dolci Italian Bakery.  Locals shop at New Seasons Market and Fred Meyer and also enjoy the retail and restaurant offerings in the nearby Kenton, St Johns and Mississippi Ave neighborhoods. %0a> %0a> While it feels less urban than its neighbors, Overlook offers very "bikable" access to downtown Portland, great mass transit options via light rail and bus and is about a 5 minute drive to downtown Portland.  Community conscious, family friendly, bicycles everywhere, walkers, dog friendly, babies in strollers.  This feels like a good place to raise a family and it feels less urban than its surround neighborhoods.  Most of the homes are well kept and cared for with landscaped yards and gardens.  Overlook homes range from condos, Bungalows, some Victorians, Foursquare and even a few ranch style homes.

During the Land Boom of the 1920s, the area was developed as the Biltmore and Shadowlawn subdivisions. Originally home to many Florida cracker immigrants from Georgia and North Carolina, the neighborhood soon became popular with the owners of nearby businesses. The houses reflect their original owners' rising social status and include fine examples of Mediterranean Revival, Mission, Craftsman, and Art Deco architecture style residences.%0a%3c %0a%3c Buena Vista, Lemon City, and Little River were founded before the turn of the 19th-century and represent some of the earliest settlements in Miami-Dade County. The area known as Buena Vista was once a small village adjoining, but not within the corporate limits of Miami proper. Although preceded in age by pioneer Lemon City, a town located a little further north, the small village of Buena Vista dates its birth, development, and growth along with Miami’s. The founding of Buena Vista dates back to the days when the immense rock ridge extending between the Atlantic Ocean and the Florida Everglades was covered by a dense pine forest. The earliest history of the village is recorded in a survey made by government surveyors, and the locations of the land tracts are to this date still founded on this early document.%0a%3c The land which became Buena Vista was originally part of the homesteads of William Henry Gleason and E.L. White. Gleason, a prominent and somewhat notorious figure in early Miami-Dade County politics, arrived in Miami after the Civil War was elected Lieutenant Governor of Florida. He left the area in 1876 but retained his homestead for several years, eventually turning it over to his son. As early as 1892, E.L. White homesteaded the area from North 41st Street to 54th Street between West 2nd Avenue and East 2nd Avenue. This was the area from which the Biltmore and Shadowlawn Subdivisions, which today make up the "Buena Vista East Historic District", were carved in the early 1920s.%0a%3c %0a%3c The arrival of the railroad in 1896 marked the end of an era for the pioneer bayfront village of Lemon City, which had enjoyed tremendous importance to the Miami area by virtue of its docks. Now the train brought much needed supplies to the rest of Dade County, and lured people away from the bayfront community to Miami and its outlying areas. The Lemon City depot, built in 1896, drew business further west away from the bay, and the small village of Buena Vista gradually developed. One of the earliest subdivisions in the Buena Vista areas was the Buena Vista Biscayne Badger Club Subdivision, which was developed in 1910 as a bayfront community with a private water plant, streets, and a park with recreation dock on the bay. However, it was inland where the village took shape. By 1910, suburban Buena Vista could boast of one hotel known as the Courley House, its very own railroad depot on the Florida East Coast Railway line, a small post office building, tropical fruit groves, a fruit-packing house, a grocery store, and one religious institution, the Holy Cross Episcopal Church.%0a%3c %0a%3c Other prominent citizens acquired land in Buena Vista. Among them was the millionaire, Charles Deering, who purchased a large tract of bayfront land east of the railroad, in the area now known as the Upper Eastside. This land is where the "Baypoint" neighborhood is now located. Much of the area fronting the bay was naturally wooded, and here Deering created an arboretum and sanctuary for birds and animals. There were no public roadways in the area east of the railroad, and since Deering strongly opposed the opening of such streets, the area was preserved in its pristine, virgin state for many years.%0a%3c %0a%3c As the population of Miami grew between the late 1910s through the Boom era of the early 1920s, new areas reached northward along the old Dixie Highway (N.E. 2nd Avenue) and Avenue D (N. Miami Avenue), which was extended northward from N.E. 36th Street. The northern city limit of Miami was moved to N.E. 38th Street, and this took in a part of Buena Vista. Finally, on August 4, 1924, the new town of Buena Vista was incorporated and, together with the other incorporated areas of Coconut Grove and Silver Bluff, was annexed to the City of Miami the following year.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!%25center%25''Piedmont''%0a> %0a> Back in the 1920's, Piedmont was one of the original suburbs of Portland but is definitely not considered one today. As a result of the Portland real estate market boom, Piedmont has seen an influx of new residents to the area which has helped to create the strong community face present today. As one might imagine, Piedmont has some wonderful areas with beautifully improved homes and neighborhoods and some still in transition. %0a> %0a> Piedmont locals enjoy easy access to New Seasons Market, what seems like their own private light rail (the Max), a half dozen coffee shops and a slew of other independent businesses and restaurants in Piedmont proper and its surrounding neighborhoods.  Portland Community College has done a great deal to revamp the area surrounding the school campus on Killingsworth and Albina.  Likewise, area residents pride themselves on rebuilding both the homes and the community. %0a> %0a> Local business standouts are New Seasons Market, The Red Fox, Saraveza (beer bottle shop), The Arbor Lodge Cafe, E'njoni Ethiopian Cafe and the locally famous Eddies Pizza.  Area locals spend a great deal of time down in the Historic Mississippi area, otherwise known as Boise-Eliot as well as Kenton and St Johns neighborhoods.%0a> %0a> The Piedmont neighborhood is also home to one of the oldest parks in the Pacific Northwest, the beautiful Peninsula Park. This stunning park is prized by locals and painstaking maintained by local volunteers as well. This park helped to earn Portland the title of “City of Roses”.  Dynamic. Community conscious. A good mix of young families, singles, and local old-timers create a nest of pride and regeneration. Neighbors bond and look out for one another. Block parties, dog walkers, joggers, bicyclists and babes in strollers are Piedmont staples.  The neighborhood consists of mostly older style homes, with a few turn of the century apartment buildings here and there. Homes run the gamut of 20th century architecture, from classic Bungalow, to Old Portland, to Cape Cod, Four Square and more. Piedmont was developed in 1895 as an upper middle class suburb (not considered a suburb today) which was quickly dubbed as "The Emerald, Portland's evergreen suburb". Piedmont means "foot of the mountain". A drive through the streets reveals many striking homes with vibrant color schemes and innovative landscaping. The area prides itself on the old growth trees which are found on nearly every street.%0a> %0a214,215c183,184%0a%3c !!!!'''Average Resources''' ••%0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a> %0a217c186%0a%3c *Buena Vista East Historic District%0a---%0a> *%25mortal%25[[City.NerdChic|Nerd Chic]]%25%25%0a223,233c192,197%0a%3c !!%25center%25''Morning Side''%0a%3c %0a%3c Started in the 1920s as "Bay Shore," it prospered in the mid-20th century and fell on hard times along with most of Miami's other inner city neighborhoods in the 60's and 70's. More recently Morningside was the first historic area in central Miami to experience gentrification with an influx of more-affluent residents. It has now been fully restored. The Morningside Historic District runs from NE 55th Street to NE 60th Street; it was the first historic district to be designated as such in the City of Miami. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992 as the Bay Shore Historic District.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Morningside Historic District is significant to the history of architecture, landscape architecture, and community development in Miami. Developed primarily between 1922 and 1941, Morningside contains a wealth of Mediterranean, Art Deco, and vernacular style houses that reflect the diversity and direction of architectural design during the 1920s and 1930s. Morningside is one of Miami's best planned subdivisions, featuring wide, tree-lined boulevards that contribute to the character of the area. This neighborhood was envisioned as an exclusive, residential community, and its amenities and location on Biscayne Bay attracted many influential and prominent local residents. One of Miami's most intact historic neighborhoods, Morningside is the City's best remaining example of a boom-era suburb.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Morningside Historic District stands today as one of Miami's most intact historic neighborhoods. Despite the number of post-1941 buildings in the area, Morningside retains a high degree of historic and architectural integrity. This is due, in part, to the fact that most later buildings are not intrusive, but respect the earlier structures in scale, setback, materials, and workmanship. The majority of neighborhood residents recognize the special character of the area and desire its continued preservation.%0a%3c %0a%3c As Miami's population expanded during the late 1920s and early 1920s, new subdivisions reached northward along Biscayne Bay. In 1922, a large, undeveloped bayfront tract near the northern city limits was platted. Called Bay Shore, this area was subdivided by the Bay Shore Investment Company and was the first of three phases that would be developed by the company between 1922 and 1924.Houses constructed in the Morningside Historic District reflect the eclecticism popular in the early twentieth century. The earlier buildings in the district are predominantly Mediterranean Revival in style, while structures built in the 1930s and early 1940s are frequently Art Deco. Outstanding examples of both styles are found here. Morningside also features a large number of masonry vernacular buildings that frequently utilize elements of several styles. An unusual Tudor Revival style house and one of the City's best examples of Mission style architecture add to the area's architectural diversity.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!%25center%25''Portsmouth''%0a> %0a> As a result of the Portland real estate market boom and like many other Portland neighborhoods, Portsmouth has seen an influx of new residents to the area.

Young, old, singletons and families -old and new- call this neighborhood home.  This area is still evolving as are most of the North Portland neighborhoods.  Community involvement is real and people are engaged.  There are still some rough areas as with most urban neighborhoods.  Overall, this community is on the rise.  Portsmouth is comprised of mostly modest homes with architectural styles such as Portland's Craftsman style Bungalow, Cottages, Old Portland, Victorian, Foursquare and other mid-sized, one and two story homes.%0a> %0a237,238c201,202%0a%3c !!!!'''Average Resources''' •••%0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a> %0a246,264c210,235%0a%3c !!%25center%25''Bay Point''%25%25%0a%3c %0a%3c The Bayside Historic District reflects the formative years of the early 1900s through the mid-1940s. Once a part of the pioneer settlement of Lemon City, Bayside contains the oldest intact community in Northeast Miami, as well as one of this area's last remaining bayfront estates. From its onset, Bayside was the home of many prominent residents who played significant roles in the business life of both Lemon City and Miami.%0a%3c %0a%3c Bayside has four distinct subdivisions which were platted between 1909 and 1925, although the area itself was first settled in the late nineteenth century. These subdivisions include Elmira (N.E. 68th Street and N.E. 67th Street), which was platted in 1909; Acadia (N.E. 70th Street), which was platted in 1915; Baywood (N.E. 69th Street and the south side of N.E. 71st Street), which was platted in 1921 and added to in 1924; and Washington Place (N.E. 72nd Street and the north side of N.E. 71st Street), which was platted in 1925.%0a%3c %0a%3c In 1909, William B. and Fred C. Miller (not related) subdivided a seven-acre bayfront lot on today's N.E. 68th Street. The Millers had come to Florida in the late 1880s from Elmira, New York and had developed Elmira Farms near Arch Creek. Their new subdivision was named Elmira, and oolitic limestone gates announced the entrance to the new community.%0a%3c %0a%3c While much of what was Lemon City has been engulfed by later developments, Elmira has remained virtually intact. Although many of its houses have deteriorated, and newer buildings have been added, the street retains much of its early character. Elmira is characterized by its excellent collection of Frame Vernacular buildings, many of which were inspired by Northern architectural styles. The Elmira Club at 742 N.E. 68th Street, for example, has Dutch Colonial Revival influences, while other houses display classical details. The majority of houses were constructed in the 1910s.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Acadia subdivision was platted in 1915 by the Realty Securities Corporation and George E. Merrick. Although the subdivision evokes the memory of Longfellow with such names as Acadian Way, Evangeline Circle, Tropical Trail, and Druid Walk, the houses developed here are distinctly Mediterranean Revival in influence. This is due perhaps to the fact that only two houses were constructed prior to 1925. Development took off during the Boom years of the mid-1920s, however, when Wykoff and Estes Builders constructed an outstanding cluster of large, two-story Mediterranean Revival style houses near the eastern end of NE 70th Street.%0a%3c %0a%3c The last subdivision to be subdivided was Washington Place, which was also developed between 1925 and the mid-1940s. Samuel J. Prescott, who platted the subdivision in 1925, had constructed his own winter home at 7101 N.E. 10th Avenue some years before. The house remains today as one of the last intact bayfront estates in Northeast Miami. The estate once featured a recreational golf course for residents and guests. Prescott was founder of the firm of Samuel J. Prescott Co., Inc., building contractors, which developed several significant buildings in downtown Washington, D.C. Prescott was chairman of the board of the Second National Bank of Washington, D.C., president of the Master Builders Association, the Builders and Manufacturers Exchange, and the Prescott Farms Company of New Hampshire.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Bayside Historic District remains today as an intact, cohesive neighborhood. Despite the number of post-1941 buildings, Bayside retains a high level of historic and architectural integrity.%0a%3c Houses constructed in Bayside reflect the diversity, direction, and taste of individual residents as well as the architectural eclecticism prevalent in the early-20th century. The earlier buildings in the district are Frame Vernacular, with several examples of early bungalows. Houses built in the 1920s are generally Mediterranean Revival in style, while structures built in the 1930s and 1940s are frequently Art Deco. Bayside also features a number of excellent examples of other architectural styles, including Mission Revival, Streamline Moderne, and Florida Ranch. Other structures, best described as Masonry Vernacular, add to the area's architectural diversity.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!%25center%25%25changeling%25''St. Johns''%25%25%0a> %0a> St. Johns feels very detached from Portland proper and has a distinct small town feel to it. The post office, coffee shops, breakfast places, restaurants, movie theaters, grocery stores, and several parks, are all within walking distance for residents who live close to the downtown strip. %0a> %0a> St. Johns has a rich and interesting history. An 1843 pioneer settler of Linnton, James John, moved across the river and started St. Johns in about 1865. St. Johns became part of Portland in1915, two years before Linnton joined the growing city. There used to be a lot of streetcars in St Johns and many interesting old houses & buildings still remain.%0a> %0a> It’s not possible to discuss St. Johns without singing the praises of the St. Johns bridge. The bridge is stunning and the focal point of many famous photos. It is often compared to the Golden Gate Bridge and mistakenly reported as being designed by the same person. The builder of the St Johns bridge was John Steinman who was rumored to be a rival to the builder of the Golden Gate Bridge.%0a> %0a> One virtue of the bridge that is often overlooked by much of Portland, is a 12 minute commute to downtown Portland and15-20minutes to Beaverton or Hillsboro. Highway 30, the road connecting the other side of the bridge to downtown Portland suffers very little traffic during the 8-5 or 9-6 commute hours (although, anecdotally, it’s busier during earlier hours 5-7 am and 2:30 - 4:30). Germantown road to Skyline or Cornelius pass dissimilarly light traffic during banker's hours commute.  St. John's is described by locals as "extremely friendly", "A town within a city..." "There seems to be quite an underground of artists and fellow travelers in these parts."  Some parts of St Johns feel new and others gritty and perhaps not so safe, especially at night.  St. John's features all styles of Portland architecture, from ranches and cape cods, to the occasional Victorian home. St. Johns is an older Portland community.%0a> %0a> St. John's is home to beautiful Cathedral Park. The aptly named park, directly below the bridge is home not only to the “cathedral-like” arches of the bridge piers, but a boat ramp, a dog off-leash area, and a hiking trail. The park itself was created out of what was essentially wasteland under the bridge in the early 70s by St. Johns honorary mayor Howard Galbraith (per Portland Parks and recreation). There is a water pollution control lab that has a charming natural habitat wetland sanctuary where you may spot nutria and red winged blackbirds. The yearly St Johns blues jazz festival is also held in Cathedral Park.%0a> %0a> Forest Park has a trailhead on the west side of the St. Johns Bridge. You can walk across the bridge and be right in the forest. Forest Park is the largest old-growth urban forest in the United States. This trail area of the park features the most wildlife--you may spot some deer and other animals foraging quietly in the forest.%0a> %0a> The Smith & Bybee Lakes wildlife sanctuary is tucked away in St.. Johns, also. It's a protected wetland scenic area that is unique and beautiful--and a bird watchers delight! The Portland Parks website indicates that most visitors to the lakes can find beaver, river otter, black-tailed deer, osprey, bald eagles, and one of the largest remaining populations of Western painted turtles in Oregon. The Columbia Slough has boat ramps where people take canoes and rafts for a relaxing ride. There is public art along the restored trail.%0a> %0a> Pier Park is another great park that is like a little forest, and sometimes hosts classical music performances.  Originally settled independently of Portland, St. Johns used to be its own city complete with City Hall.  Now that building houses the police station, and the two towns are one.  Or are they?%0a> %0a> Of course legally the two cities are one.  And then there's that Kum Ba Yah can’t-we-all-just-get-along way, sure.  But walking the streets, it doesn’t take long to get the vibe that, “Toto, we’re not in Portland anymore.”%0a> %0a> Somewhere between the architecture that’s frozen at different moments in Main Street Americana and the fiercely, did I mention fiercely, proud neighbors and proprietors, is a sense of community that is different, special, even self-reflective. It's as if the community pastime consists of pinching oneself at the opportunity to live and work in St. Johns.%0a> %0a> Of course, some of the St. Johns’ satisfaction has to do with age. No rocket science here. Plain and simple, history equals roots equals pride. And in St. Johns, you can’t throw a rock and not hit something historic.  Some of the oldest buildings in all of Portland are in St. Johns and some of the oldest businesses. The bike shop clocks in as the very first, established in 1925 and now in its third generation.  The bakery is also in its third generation.  The hardware store was the oldest in the land before hard times, but it’s making a comeback.  You can chomp on pizza at a gas station that goes back to the‘30s, and the soda fountain was flowing in the ‘50s.%0a> %0a> Most of the proprietors live nearby, and their sense of community weighs in far stronger than any feelings of competition.

It is roughly bound by North 20th Street to the south, I-195 to the north, I-95 to the west and Biscayne Bay to the east.%0a%3c %0a%3c In 2005, construction began on the "Midtown Miami" development between North 29th and 36th Street and Miami Avenue and the Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) on what was historically an FEC rail yard. The project is a large-scale, urban development that was planned with 8 high-rise residential buildings, a hotel, two parks, and a major urban shopping area, "The Shops at Midtown". Due to the collapse of the real estate bubble in 2007, only two residential buildings, and about 2/3 of "The Shops at Midtown" were built. In July 2011, plans were announced to begin construction on a new entertainment center at Midtown, including a hotel, and shops on the site of the current temporary park in the center of Midtown. Critics of Midtown state the lack of parks as a major issue.%0a%3c %0a%3c Midtown has grown quickly, and is home to Shops at Midtown, an outdoor shopping area designed to mimic New York's SOHO neighborhood, and home to many national and local stores and restaurants including Target, Guess, HomeGoods, Marshalls, Sakaya Kitchen, Baru Urbano, Novecento & IT Lounge, Riviera Focacceria Italiana, Giraffas Brazilian Grill, Spris, Bar Louie, Wine Vault, 100 Montaditos, World of Beer, Chef Leon, Mercado Latino, My Ceviche, Five Guys Burgers & Fries, 4D Gelateria, Hurricane Grill & Wings, Lime Fresh Mexican Grill, Spun Candy, Pinkberry, SugarCane, Mercadito, Lagniappe, Sustain, Cheese Course, Buro Miami, Ring Finger Studio, and an abundance of upscale apartments. A fair amount of office businesses have also taken up residence in Midtown in office buildings, in industries ranging from interior decor to marketing agency services, and more. At Büro Urbano urban workspace, office spaces are provided for small businesses. Midtown has also become home to Art Miami art fair, which takes place during Miami's Art Basel week.%0a%3c %0a%3c On 1 August 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a travel warning, advising pregnant women not to visit Midtown Miami, the Design District and Wynwood areas to avoid getting the Zika virus. Zika warnings in Miami have been lifted by the end of 2016%0a%3c %0a%3c Bacardi's United States headquarters were located in the Bacardi buildings also near Midtown Miami. By 2007 Bacardi USA agreed to lease a complex in Coral Gables to use as its new headquarters. At that time, Bacardi had employees in seven buildings across South Florida. Bacardi vacated its former headquarters buildings. Miami citizens began a campaign to label the buildings as historic. Allan T. Schulman, a professor of architecture at the University of Miami, said "Miami's brand is its identity as a tropical city. The Bacardi buildings are exactly the sort that resonate with our consciousness of what Miami is about."  In 2007 Chad Oppenheim, the head of Oppenheim Architecture + Design, described the Bacardi buildings as "elegant, with a Modernist [look combined with] a local flavor." In late 2012, the National YoungArts Foundation purchased the storied Bacardi buildings and converted them into their national headquarters%0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!%25center%25%25changeling%25''University Park''%25%25%0a> %0a> University Park is located in North Portland and is bordered by Cathedral Park, St. Johns, University Park and Linnton neighborhoods. University Park is a neighborhood that doesn't dazzle with grand old houses or sculpted greenery or cafes with colorful facades and outside seating. This is a community of nice, modest houses and the students and families who reside in them, a place of straight and relatively quiet streets frequented by bicyclists who prefer a residential area to ride through rather than brave the velocity and vehicle exhaust of North Lombard Street, the busy commercial thoroughfare that serves as this neighborhood's northern boundary.%0a> %0a> University Park is the home of the University of Portland, the well-known private Catholic school highly regarded by its students. The presence of the school in the community accounts for the high percentage of homes rented. Astor Elementary School is nearby, in the center of the neighborhood. McKenna Park and Portsmouth Park are only a few blocks apart on North Princeton Street, perfect for a game of catch or a walk with the dog.  As a result of the Portland real estate market boom and like many other Portland neighborhoods, University Park has seen an influx of new residents to the area. As one might imagine, University Park has some wonderful areas with nicely improved homes and neighborhoods and some still in transition.%0a> University Park is home to one of the oldest schools in the area, the University of Portland.  There is a large student population and much of the area feels young and vibrant. Adidas Corporation is a large area employer as is the Swan Island industrial area.  Commuters here have many options: a quick and easy bike ride to downtown via bike lane nearly the whole way, great mass transit options via bus and the Max light rail train located on Interstate Avenue and a 10 minute drive to downtown Portland via car.   Young, old, singletons and families all call this neighborhood home. There is a large student population in this neighborhood due to University of Portland. This is an active, outdoorsy area- rain or shine guarantees you will see bikers, runners and dog walkers on Willamette.  University Park is comprised of mostly modest homes with architectural styles such as Portland's Craftsman style Bungalow, Cottages, Old Portland, Victorian, Foursquare and other mid-sized, one and two story homes.%0a> %0a289a256%0a> *%25changeling%25Changelings%25%25%0a291,293c258,259%0a%3c *%0a%3c !!!!'''Average Resources''' ••••%0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a> %0a295,430c261%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25''Design District''%25%25%0a%3c %0a%3c The Miami Design District is a neighborhood in Miami, Florida, United States and a shopping, dining and cultural destination.

diff:1528451328:1528442036:=34,37c34,37%0a%3c As a result of the Portland real estate market boom and several key area improvements benefiting the neighborhood, Arbor Lodge has evolved a great deal over the last many years.  New to the area over the last decade and greatly improving the lives of its residents are the Max light rail line located on Interstate, New Seasons Market, a vastly improved and remodeled Fred Meyer and a lot of new life in the area in terms of independent businesses such as restaurants, boutiques, bike shops and of course, coffee shops. Just five minutes from downtown Portland, Arbor Lodge offers convenient, easy access to other popular N and NE Portland neighborhoods. If you enjoy the euro-urbanite lifestyle of bicycling, walking and neighborhood owned coffee and grocery shops, Arbor Lodge might be the perfect fit for you.%0a%3c %0a%3c Arbor Lodge homes run the gamut of 20th century architecture, from classic Bungalow, to Old Portland, to Cape Cod and more. A drive through the neighborhood streets reveals quiet streets and modest homes. The area is restoration focused and community minded.  Dynamic. Community conscious. Prolific growth. A good mix of young families, singles, and local old-timers who care about one another and the community. Neighbors bond and look out for one another. Block parties, dog walkers, joggers, bicyclists, feet hitting pavement and babes in strollers are Arbor Lodge staples.  As with the surrounding neighborhoods, Arbor Lodge's real estate values have launched from &#2013266067;fixer-upper starter home&#2013266068; just a few years ago to &#2013266067;established&#2013266068;. %0a%3c %0a---%0a> Arbor Lodge is a neighborhood in the North section of Portland, Oregon. Interstate 5 forms the eastern boundary of the neighborhood. The North Lombard Transit Center and the Rosa Parks stations on the MAX Yellow Line provide light rail service to the neighborhood. Their opening in 2004 was part of a spurt of new development in the neighborhood, including a New Seasons Market and a Fred Meyer mega-store.%0a> %0a> Arbor Lodge Park (1940) serves the neighborhood.%0a> %0a52,59c52,57%0a%3c Bridgeton offers a charming, small-town community feel, where many neighbors know each other by name. The area is a marine community as it is located in the south channel of the Columbia River. Bridgeton residents, while in Oregon, are located just about halfway between Portland and Vancouver, Washington making dining and shopping that much more varied in terms of options. Commuting to both cities is quick and easy during off hours but northbound traffic on I-5 is often bottlenecked during rush hour.%0a%3c %0a%3c Some issues concerning the Bridgeton community include care of the environment, water safety, traffic and noise control, and the proposed Columbia River Crossing project .  "The Columbia River Crossing project is aimed at improving the mobility, reliability, and accessibility for automobile, freight, transit, bicycle, and pedestrian users of the I-5 corridor from State Route 500 in Vancouver to approximately Columbia Boulevard in Portland. Through an inclusive, collaborative process, this project will deliver a financially feasible solution that strengthens the regional economy and strives to support community livability." %0a%3c %0a%3c To get a local's view of Bridgeton, be sure to check out the Bridgeton Blog, and the Bridgeton neighborhood association website at BridgetonPdx.com%0a%3c %0a%3c The Max light rail train is easily accessed by local residents and the I-5 freeway is also very close and convenient. Bridgeton is located in very close proximity to the Portland International Airport just a few minutes drive east off Marine Drive. Airport noise has been a concern and annoyance to some Bridgeton neighbors.  Active and outdoorsy.  This is a beautiful area and feels very different than the rest of urban Portland. Bridgeton offers a charming, small-town community feel, where neighbors know each other by name. Here you'll find people living on the water, with a genuine appreciation for their scenic natural surroundings. You might see people feeding the ducks, or greeting the other feathered friends who share the neighborhood, like "Gus", the local goose.  Bridgeton homes are varied from traditional residential homes, house boats and floating homes, townhomes, condos and some upscale apartment homes. While Bridgeton's lifestyle seems miles away from the urban living in Downtown Portland, Bridgeton is only about a 15 minute drive to Downtown along I-5, and a similar short distance from the Portland International Airport. There's a ton of local shopping nearby at Jantzen Beach shopping center. So, if you want to live a water-focused lifestyle, feeling as though you are somewhat away from it all and yet still close enough to modern conveniences: Bridgeton might be for you.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Bridgeton is a compact neighborhood of detached houses, rowhouses, apartment and condominium complexes, and houseboats in the north and northeast sections of Portland, Oregon. It occupies a narrow strip of land around a levee between the Columbia River (North Portland Harbor) and Bridgeton Slough.%0a> %0a> In 1907, a one-room schoolhouse, the Columbia School, was constructed in the area. Between 1915 and 1930, housing was developed in the area, which was the terminus of the Vancouver Interurban streetcar line. The Faloma post office served the area from August 13, 1921, to June 15, 1935; the USGS still uses this name for the place. Local citizens chose this from the initials of three local landowners (Force, Love and Moore) after the United States Postal Service rejected Bridgeton as too common.%0a> %0a> The Bridgeton Neighborhood Association was formed in March 1992 to deal with crime and traffic issues, and shortly thereafter was instrumental in defeating a rezoning request for a superstore to be constructed nearby%0a> %0a74,77c72,75%0a%3c Cathedral Park is located in North Portland near the St Johns Bridge. Cathedral Park is a quaint neighborhood community with a gorgeous park located on the waterfront which is its namesake.  St Johns and Kenton neighborhoods are its nearest neighbors. A trip to downtown Portland is about a 15 minute drive or 30 minute bike ride.  Cathedral Park residents use the Interstate Max light rail train for a convenient commute to downtown and other Portland neighborhoods.  As a result of the Portland real estate market boom, Cathedral Park has seen an influx of new residents to the area. University of Portland is local to the area and brings a lot of students to the neighborhood. As one might imagine, Cathedral Park has some wonderful areas with beautifully improved homes and neighborhoods and some still in transition. %0a%3c %0a%3c Residents use the St Johns Safeway, Fred Meyer, Arbor Lodge New Seasons Market and have their pick of St Johns, Kenton, Arbor Lodge (and more) restaurants, boutiques, bike shops and of course, coffee shops.  Community conscious. A good mix of students, young families, singles, and local old-timers. Dog walkers, blue collars, hippies and professionals.  Joggers, bicyclists, and babes in strollers.  Cathedral Park homes run the gamut of 20th century architecture, from classic Bungalow, to Old Portland, to Cape Cod and condo and apartment style housing. A drive through the neighborhood streets reveals many quiet streets and modest homes. The area seems focused on restoration and is overall community minded.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Cathedral Park is a neighborhood in Portland, Oregon. It is situated on a peninsula and lies on the east shore of the Willamette River. The neighborhood is named after Cathedral Park, which is located under the St. Johns Bridge, and was given its name due to the Gothic arches that support the bridge, which resemble a cathedral arch.  The St. Johns Bridge connects the neighborhood to the Linnton and Northwest Industrial neighborhoods in Northwest Portland across the Willamette River. In addition to these neighborhoods, Cathedral Park is bordered by St. Johns to the northeast and University Park to the southeast.%0a> %0a> The 1911 Sanborn Map Index for the City of St. Johns, Oregon shows that the Cathedral Park neighborhood was part of the original City of St. Johns prior to annexation by Portland in 1915.  The neighborhood is named after its most prominent landmark, the city park also called Cathedral Park, which in turn is named after the cathedral-like columns of the St. Johns Bridge it surrounds.%0a> %0a92,95c90,93%0a%3c East Columbia is located between Sunderland, Bridgeton and Kenton neighborhoods in North Portland.  As a result of the Portland real estate market boom and like many other Portland neighborhoods, East Columbia has seen an influx of new residents to the area. As one might imagine, East Columbia has some wonderful areas with beautifully improved homes and neighborhoods and some still in transition. %0a%3c %0a%3c Residents use the Jantzen Beach shopping center (Target and Safeway), St Johns Safeway, Fred Meyer, Arbor Lodge New Seasons Market and have their pick of St Johns, Kenton, Bridgeton, Arbor Lodge (and more) restaurants, boutiques, bike shops and of course, coffee shops.  Marine community. Outdoorsy and active. A mix of young and old, blue and white collars and entrepreneurs, too.  As with the surrounding neighborhoods, East Columbia's real estate values have launched from “fixer-upper starter home” just a few years ago to “established”. %0a%3c %0a---%0a> East Columbia is a neighborhood in North and Northeast Portland, Oregon, consisting of a main area west and north of the Sunderland neighborhood, and a smaller disconnected exclave on the Columbia River south of Hayden Island and east of Bridgeton.%0a> %0a> The neighborhood includes the Columbia Children's Arboretum (1999) and the Columbia Edgewater Golf Club.%0a> %0a110,115c108,117%0a%3c Hayden Island is located in North Portland. It is bordered by the North Portland Harbor and Columbia River, Tomahawk and Hayden Islands.  As a result of the Portland real estate market boom and like many other Portland neighborhoods, Hayden Island has seen an influx of new residents to the area. As one might imagine, Hayden Island has some wonderful areas with beautifully improved homes and neighborhoods and some still in transition. %0a%3c %0a%3c Residents use the Jantzen Beach shopping center Target and Safeway for grocery and have a handful of restaurants available on Hayden Island.  Max light rail access is available at Delta Park, just a few minutes south on I-5. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hayden Island residents are right between Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Washington.  Commuter traffic during rush hour is a concern as residents head north to Vancouver.  Hayden Island is located North along the Columbia River. A mix of home styles can be found, including house boats, condos, apartments and trailer homes. Hayden Island offers a great lifestyle for those who love the water.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Hayden Island is an island in the Columbia River between Vancouver, Washington and Portland, Oregon. The wide main channel of the Columbia (and the Washington/Oregon state line) passes north of the island. To the south, sheltered by the island, is a smaller channel known as North Portland Harbor. Much of Hayden Island (and connected Tomahawk Island to the east) is within Portland city limits, and recognized as one of its 95 neighborhoods.%0a> %0a> Interstate 5 provides the only roadway connection to the island, via the northernmost Oregon exit, to the rest of North Portland and, with the Interstate Bridge, to Vancouver to the north. The BNSF Railway crosses North Portland Harbor (via the Oregon Slough Railroad Bridge) and the western part of the island to the west of I-5, before crossing the Columbia via the Burlington Northern Railroad Bridge 9.6. The east end of the island, often called Jantzen Beach, has highly developed retail areas near the freeway, hotels, offices, manufactured home communities, and condominium complexes. Further east there are several houseboat moorages and marinas.%0a> %0a> Until the Interstate Bridge opened in 1917 ferries provided service between Portland and Vancouver from landings on the island's north shore. After the opening of the bridge, streetcar service opened Hayden Island to amusement park developments due to its beaches and strategic location. Jantzen Beach, the last operating amusement park, closed in 1970. Tomahawk Island, just off the east tip of Hayden Island, became another amusement park—Lotus Isle—for a few years in the 1930s.%0a> %0a> Because Oregon does not have a state sales tax, and Washington has one of the higher state sales taxes, it is common practice for people in Southwest Washington to travel to Oregon for larger taxable purchases. The Jantzen Beach Shopping Center and many hotels populate this part of the island. A narrow neck of land connects Hayden Island to Tomahawk Island (not an independent island since construction of the linkage), which has numerous marinas, yacht clubs, and the Yacht Harbor Club apartment community.%0a> %0a> The west side of the island (in unincorporated Multnomah County) is as yet undeveloped, though it was added to the urban growth boundary by voters in 1983. The Port of Portland purchased the land in 1993 with the intention of building a large cargo facility. Metro, the regional government, has designated West Hayden Island as both high value regionally significant habitat and an industrial land. Environmental activists have successfully blocked annexation for industrial development in 1999. But the Port of Portland renewed efforts to annex West Hayden Island in 2008 and Portland City Council voted July 29, 2010 to go forward with an analysis of annexation that would allow 300 acres (1.2 km2) for an undetermined port facility and preserve the remaining 500 acres (2.0 km2) as a protected natural area.%0a> %0a130,136c132,141%0a%3c The Kenton neighborhood is located in North Portland and is bordered by Arbor Lodge, St. Johns, and Piedmont neighborhoods. Kenton is also in close proximity to other popular neighborhoods via the Max light rail which is located on nearby Interstate Avenue. A drive to downtown Portland is a mere 7-8 minutes away in good traffic conditions and a bike ride is about 25 minutes and is in mostly designated bike lanes.  Like many of the surrounding Portland neighborhoods, Kenton has been evolving but on a slower scale. The streets have new life and many of the vacant buildings have been rented and great local businesses have emerged. Locals enjoy indie businesses such as Posie's Coffee, The Kenton Pub, Pizza Fino, E-San Thai, The Cup and Saucer Cafe and their very own library. %0a%3c %0a%3c Kenton has some wonderful areas with beautifully improved homes and streets yet some are still in transition. Denver is the main drag and feels like the downtown in a very tiny city.   Evolving. On the cusp of something special...something fantastic. Neighborhood locals are extremely down-home, very approachable. Walking through the commercial district of Kenton will spark entrepreneurial thoughts of opening your own cute store front. For those of you that remember Mississippi Ave before it was a hip, thriving district, you'll know that just a decade ago, the area was basically abandoned and largely unsafe. All it took was a few brave entrepreneurs to come in and begin to fill the void.%0a%3c We predict that Kenton is one of the next up and coming neighborhood in North Portland.  Kenton is comprised of mostly modest homes with architectural styles such as Portland's Craftsman style Bungalow, Cottages, Old Portland, Victorian, Foursquare and other mid-sized, one and two story homes.%0a%3c %0a%3c There are some amazing old homes in Kenton, especially on Denver Avenue, which is the start of the commercial district. True to Portland style, this neighborhood will reveal creative paint schemes, innovative landscaping, and attention-to-detail restoration efforts. This lovely neighborhood is truly a gem given some still affordable home prices and a neighborhood community that truly cares about the growth and overall livability of the area.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Kenton is a neighborhood in the north section of Portland, Oregon, United States. The neighborhood was originally a company town founded in 1911 for the Swift Meat Packing Company.  Kenton's northern border is formed by North Portland Harbor, the channel of the Columbia River that separates the area from Hayden Island. Kenton's eastern boundary is Interstate 5 and the neighborhood's southern edge is defined by North Lombard Street. The western border (traveling from north to south, respectively) follows North Portland Road, North Columbia Boulevard, and North Chautauqua Boulevard. The Columbia Slough passes through Kenton.%0a> %0a> Neighborhoods bordering Kenton are: Hayden Island to the north; Bridgeton, Sunderland, and Piedmont to the east; Arbor Lodge to the south; University Park to the southwest; and Portsmouth and St. Johns to the west.%0a> %0a> Kenton is home to the Portland International Raceway and the Portland Metropolitan Expo Center. The historic site of Vanport, a public housing project built to provide homes for World War II shipbuilders, later destroyed by a 1948 flood, is also located within the current boundaries of the Kenton neighborhood.  Before the 1900s, Kenton was a farming community similar to other townships in the area like University Park and St. Johns until it became a company town built by the Swift Meat Packing Company. By 1910, US$120,000 worth of buildings had been erected in the neighborhood with many fashioned out of concrete and brick. Two three-story brick hotels were built in Kenton in 1910. Plants from companies like the National Wood Pipe Company, Davis Safe and Lock Company, Union Meat Company and Portland Union Stockyards called Kenton home. A concrete apartment building was built by C. H. Carey costing US$22,000. In 1909, Portland, Oregon Mayor Joseph Simon took an automobile trip to Kenton where he announced general improvements for the community like road pavement, street lamps and a fire station. The streets were still dirt in 1910, leading the Kenton Push Club to lobby the Portland City Council to pass a bond to pave the roads. After a long fight with the city council, the roads were paved in 1911. By 1913, US$300,000 had been spent on paving the streets of Kenton. The growing community soon demanded a park, library and schoolhouse. Just a few years later, Kenton was annexed with St. Johns by the City of Portland, becoming home to Portland's main stockyards and the center of the West Coast cattle trade for a time.%0a> %0a> A story of the "Kenton ghost" was published in the January 5, 1913 edition of The Oregonian which recounted several residents accounts of a shadowy figure lurking the streets of the community. Several prominent citizens came forward with their own sightings of the ghost including the secretary of the Interstate Bridge Commission. Former Albina, Oregon Mayor W. M. Killingsworth led a group of people who looked for the ghost. Kenton had a semi-professional baseball team in 1916 and 1917. The Kenton Giants played in the Inter-City League with three other teams.%0a> %0a> The 1959 Oregon Centennial celebrations were held in Kenton.To commemorate the occasion, a large statue of Paul Bunyan was built at the intersection of North Interstate Avenue and North Argyle Street (just north of Kenton's historic business district on North Denver Avenue) as a reminder of centennial festivities. The statue still stands at the corner of North Interstate and North Denver, across from the Kenton/N Denver Ave light rail station, and is considered a symbol of the neighborhood. The statue was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 28, 2009. Directly across N Denver Ave from the Paul Bunyan Statue are the four blue hooves of Babe the Blue Ox, his trusted animal companion%0a> %0a151,156c156,165%0a%3c Overlook is located in North Portland and is bordered by the popular University Park, Arbor Lodge, Humboldt, Boise, and Eliot neighborhoods.  Overlook also includes what is known as Swan Island, a mostly industrial area with an active recreational boat launch and port.  As a result of the Portland real estate market boom and like many other Portland neighborhoods, Overlook has seen an influx of new residents to the area. As one might imagine, Overlook has some wonderful areas with beautifully improved homes and neighborhoods and some still in transition. %0a%3c %0a%3c This area feels a bit secluded as it is on the "other side" of Interstate Avenue but offers convenient access to other local neighborhoods, and the Max light rail train.  Local businesses thrive here- a few standouts are the wacky and ever popular Alibi bar, Pause, Miho Izakaya, Beaterville, Fire on the Mountain, The Overlook House and Dip Rima Dolci Italian Bakery.  Locals shop at New Seasons Market and Fred Meyer and also enjoy the retail and restaurant offerings in the nearby Kenton, St Johns and Mississippi Ave neighborhoods. %0a%3c %0a%3c While it feels less urban than its neighbors, Overlook offers very "bikable" access to downtown Portland, great mass transit options via light rail and bus and is about a 5 minute drive to downtown Portland.  Community conscious, family friendly, bicycles everywhere, walkers, dog friendly, babies in strollers.  This feels like a good place to raise a family and it feels less urban than its surround neighborhoods.  Most of the homes are well kept and cared for with landscaped yards and gardens.  Overlook homes range from condos, Bungalows, some Victorians, Foursquare and even a few ranch style homes.  This area is very pretty, feels safe and has old growth trees that line many of the streets.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Overlook is a neighborhood in the North section of Portland, Oregon on the east shore of the Willamette River. It borders University Park and Arbor Lodge on the north, Humboldt and Boise on the east, Eliot on the southeast, and Northwest Industrial and the Northwest District across the Willamette on the west.%0a> %0a> The Overlook Park Station, the N. Prescott St. Station and the N. Killingsworth Station on the MAX Yellow Line provide light rail service to the neighborhood.%0a> %0a> Overlook House (1928) serves as a community center. The Interstate Firehouse Cultural Center, next to Patton Park, features arts education, exhibits and theater.%0a> %0a> The neighborhood includes Swan Island, originally an island in the Willamette, but connected to the east bank by landfill in the 1920s. Swan Island was the site of Portland's first airport, Swan Island Municipal Airport, dedicated by Charles Lindbergh in 1927 and operating until the early 1940s when the island was converted to naval shipbuilding use for World War II as one of the Kaiser Shipyards. Swan Island is now an industrial area.%0a> %0a> This neighborhood is also occasionally referred to as Mocks Crest.%0a> %0a171,178c180,189%0a%3c Back in the 1920's, Piedmont was one of the original suburbs of Portland but is definitely not considered one today. As a result of the Portland real estate market boom, Piedmont has seen an influx of new residents to the area which has helped to create the strong community face present today. As one might imagine, Piedmont has some wonderful areas with beautifully improved homes and neighborhoods and some still in transition. %0a%3c %0a%3c Piedmont locals enjoy easy access to New Seasons Market, what seems like their own private light rail (the Max), a half dozen coffee shops and a slew of other independent businesses and restaurants in Piedmont proper and its surrounding neighborhoods.  Portland Community College has done a great deal to revamp the area surrounding the school campus on Killingsworth and Albina.  Likewise, area residents pride themselves on rebuilding both the homes and the community. %0a%3c %0a%3c Local business standouts are New Seasons Market, The Red Fox, Saraveza (beer bottle shop), The Arbor Lodge Cafe, E'njoni Ethiopian Cafe and the locally famous Eddies Pizza.  Area locals spend a great deal of time down in the Historic Mississippi area, otherwise known as Boise-Eliot as well as Kenton and St Johns neighborhoods.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Piedmont neighborhood is also home to one of the oldest parks in the Pacific Northwest, the beautiful Peninsula Park. This stunning park is prized by locals and painstaking maintained by local volunteers as well. This park helped to earn Portland the title of “City of Roses”.  Dynamic. Community conscious. A good mix of young families, singles, and local old-timers create a nest of pride and regeneration. Neighbors bond and look out for one another. Block parties, dog walkers, joggers, bicyclists and babes in strollers are Piedmont staples.  The neighborhood consists of mostly older style homes, with a few turn of the century apartment buildings here and there. Homes run the gamut of 20th century architecture, from classic Bungalow, to Old Portland, to Cape Cod, Four Square and more. Piedmont was developed in 1895 as an upper middle class suburb (not considered a suburb today) which was quickly dubbed as "The Emerald, Portland's evergreen suburb". Piedmont means "foot of the mountain". A drive through the streets reveals many striking homes with vibrant color schemes and innovative landscaping. The area prides itself on the old growth trees which are found on nearly every street.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Piedmont is a neighborhood in the north and northeast piedmontsections of Portland. The original subdivision, now known as “Historic Piedmont,” includes parts of the Humboldt and King neighborhoods, as well as the modern Piedmont neighborhood south of Rosa Parks Way. It is bordered by these neighborhoods:  East Columbia to the north, Woodlawn to the east, Humboldt to the south, and Arbor Lodge along with Kenton to the west.%0a> %0a> Peninsula Park is just a hint of what’s blooming in the Piedmont neighborhood, bordered by Interstate 5, Northeast Columbia Boulevard, Northeast Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and North Ainsworth Street. It’s a neighborhood in transition, with new affordable home developments being built, older houses being remodeled, and the Interstate MAX light-rail line just a few blocks west. It’s a convenient commute to downtown Portland and just take minutes by car or public transportation.%0a> %0a> The Piedmont subdivision was one of the early streetcar suburbs so when the Interstate MAX light-rail arrived in 2004, the neighborhood revisited its past.%0a> %0a> Peninsula Park was originally the site of Liverpool Liz’s Place, a roadhouse and horse-racing track. The 16-acre plot of land was purchased by the city in 1909 and reconfigured as a grand city park by noted architects Ellis Lawrence and Ormond Bean. The park, its Italian-style community center, and rose gardens, opened to the public in 1913. The rose gardens were a big hit, drawing 300,000 visitors in their first year. The octagonal bandstand overlooking the rose garden was constructed in 1913. It was used for World War I patriotic demonstrations and is now the site for many summer weddings and concerts. This wonderful gazebo-like structure is a National Heritage historical structure and was designated a Portland Historic Landmark in 1973. It is the last of its kind in Portland.%0a> %0a> In 1947, after a failed attempt to build a NABISCO factory in the Rose City Park neighborhood, a factory location along Columbia Boulevard was chosen. The plant was completed in August 1950.  In the book, The Zombie Survival Guide by Max Brooks, there is a faux zombie attack recorded in which zombies attacked Piedmont and the citizens attempt to hide in the cave mines.  Doll Asylum, an annual Halloween experience hosted at a private residence since 2010.%0a> %0a193,196c204,207%0a%3c As a result of the Portland real estate market boom and like many other Portland neighborhoods, Portsmouth has seen an influx of new residents to the area. As one might imagine, Portsmouth has some wonderful areas with beautifully improved homes and neighborhoods and some still in transition. %0a%3c %0a%3c Residents use the Jantzen Beach shopping center (Target and Safeway), St Johns Safeway, Fred Meyer, Arbor Lodge New Seasons Market and have their pick of St Johns, Kenton, Cathedral Park, Arbor Lodge (and more) restaurants, boutiques, bike shops and of course, coffee shops.  Young, old, singletons and families -old and new- call this neighborhood home.  This area is still evolving as are most of the North Portland neighborhoods.  Community involvement is real and people are engaged.  There are still some rough areas as with most urban neighborhoods.  Overall, this community is on the rise.  Portsmouth is comprised of mostly modest homes with architectural styles such as Portland's Craftsman style Bungalow, Cottages, Old Portland, Victorian, Foursquare and other mid-sized, one and two story homes.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Portsmouth is a neighborhood in the North section of Portland, Oregon. It is named for Portsmouth Avenue, a major street in the district. It is bordered by Lombard Street to the South, Chautauqua Boulevard to the East, Columbia Boulevard to the North, and the Burlington Northern Railway to the West. The neighborhood is served by Portsmouth Middle School and two elementary schools.%0a> %0a> Portsmouth used to also include the neighborhood that is now known as University Park. This explains both the name of the neighborhood ("ports" + "mouth" = Portsmouth was bordered on one side by the Columbia River and on another side by the Willamette River) as well as why there's a park named "Portsmouth Park" in University Park neighborhood.%0a> %0a211,234c222,227%0a%3c St. Johns feels very detached from Portland proper and has a distinct small town feel to it. The post office, coffee shops, breakfast places, restaurants, movie theaters, grocery stores, and several parks, are all within walking distance for residents who live close to the downtown strip. %0a%3c %0a%3c St. Johns has a rich and interesting history. An 1843 pioneer settler of Linnton, James John, moved across the river and started St. Johns in about 1865. St. Johns became part of Portland in1915, two years before Linnton joined the growing city. There used to be a lot of streetcars in St Johns and many interesting old houses & buildings still remain.%0a%3c %0a%3c It’s not possible to discuss St. Johns without singing the praises of the St. Johns bridge. The bridge is stunning and the focal point of many famous photos. It is often compared to the Golden Gate Bridge and mistakenly reported as being designed by the same person. The builder of the St Johns bridge was John Steinman who was rumored to be a rival to the builder of the Golden Gate Bridge.%0a%3c %0a%3c One virtue of the bridge that is often overlooked by much of Portland, is a 12 minute commute to downtown Portland and15-20minutes to Beaverton or Hillsboro. Highway 30, the road connecting the other side of the bridge to downtown Portland suffers very little traffic during the 8-5 or 9-6 commute hours (although, anecdotally, it’s busier during earlier hours 5-7 am and 2:30 - 4:30). Germantown road to Skyline or Cornelius pass dissimilarly light traffic during banker's hours commute.  St. John's is described by locals as "extremely friendly", "A town within a city..." "There seems to be quite an underground of artists and fellow travelers in these parts."  Some parts of St Johns feel new and others gritty and perhaps not so safe, especially at night.  St. John's features all styles of Portland architecture, from ranches and cape cods, to the occasional Victorian home. St. Johns is an older Portland community.%0a%3c %0a%3c St. John's is home to beautiful Cathedral Park. The aptly named park, directly below the bridge is home not only to the “cathedral-like” arches of the bridge piers, but a boat ramp, a dog off-leash area, and a hiking trail. The park itself was created out of what was essentially wasteland under the bridge in the early 70s by St. Johns honorary mayor Howard Galbraith (per Portland Parks and recreation). There is a water pollution control lab that has a charming natural habitat wetland sanctuary where you may spot nutria and red winged blackbirds. The yearly St Johns blues jazz festival is also held in Cathedral Park.%0a%3c %0a%3c Forest Park has a trailhead on the west side of the St. Johns Bridge. You can walk across the bridge and be right in the forest. Forest Park is the largest old-growth urban forest in the United States. This trail area of the park features the most wildlife--you may spot some deer and other animals foraging quietly in the forest.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Smith & Bybee Lakes wildlife sanctuary is tucked away in St.. Johns, also. It's a protected wetland scenic area that is unique and beautiful--and a bird watchers delight! The Portland Parks website indicates that most visitors to the lakes can find beaver, river otter, black-tailed deer, osprey, bald eagles, and one of the largest remaining populations of Western painted turtles in Oregon. The Columbia Slough has boat ramps where people take canoes and rafts for a relaxing ride. There is public art along the restored trail.%0a%3c %0a%3c Pier Park is another great park that is like a little forest, and sometimes hosts classical music performances.  Originally settled independently of Portland, St. Johns used to be its own city complete with City Hall.  Now that building houses the police station, and the two towns are one.  Or are they?%0a%3c %0a%3c Of course legally the two cities are one.  And then there's that Kum Ba Yah can’t-we-all-just-get-along way, sure.  But walking the streets, it doesn’t take long to get the vibe that, “Toto, we’re not in Portland anymore.”%0a%3c %0a%3c Somewhere between the architecture that’s frozen at different moments in Main Street Americana and the fiercely, did I mention fiercely, proud neighbors and proprietors, is a sense of community that is different, special, even self-reflective. It's as if the community pastime consists of pinching oneself at the opportunity to live and work in St. Johns.%0a%3c %0a%3c Of course, some of the St. Johns’ satisfaction has to do with age. No rocket science here. Plain and simple, history equals roots equals pride. And in St. Johns, you can’t throw a rock and not hit something historic.  Some of the oldest buildings in all of Portland are in St. Johns and some of the oldest businesses. The bike shop clocks in as the very first, established in 1925 and now in its third generation.  The bakery is also in its third generation.  The hardware store was the oldest in the land before hard times, but it’s making a comeback.  You can chomp on pizza at a gas station that goes back to the‘30s, and the soda fountain was flowing in the ‘50s.%0a%3c %0a%3c Most of the proprietors live nearby, and their sense of community weighs in far stronger than any feelings of competition.  When you talk to shop owners in St. Johns, they can't wait to recommend several other shops on the block.  They’ll tell you who owns them, how long they've been around, and the quality work they're up to.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> St. Johns is a neighborhood of Portland, Oregon, United States, located in North Portland on the tip of the peninsula formed by the confluence of the Willamette River and the Columbia River. It was a separate, incorporated city from 1902 until 1915, when citizens of both St. Johns and Portland voted to approve its annexation to Portland, which took effect on July 8, 1915.%0a> %0a> St. Johns is bordered by the Columbia River to the northeast, the Willamette River to the northwest, and the North Portland railroad to the southeast. The Cathedral Park neighborhood – which is home to the St. Johns Bridge, the only suspension bridge in the Willamette Valley – lies to the southwest.[3] The main business district of St. Johns (referred to as "Downtown" or "Deep St. Johns") is around the intersection of Lombard and Philadelphia Streets.%0a> %0a> St. Johns and North Portland are known for their proximity to natural habitats. There are many parks and natural areas in St. Johns, including Pier Park, the Columbia Slough, Kelley Point Park (1984), Pier Park (1959), the Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area (1961), not to mention that it is near Cathedral Park and Baltimore Woods in the Cathedral Park Neighborhood and right across the river from Forest Park. Upon entering St. Johns there is a conspicuously placed sign in the traffic median which says, "Welcome to the Peninsula, Gateway to Nature". Sightings of bald eagles and other birds of prey are common.%0a> %0a249,252c242,248%0a%3c University Park is located in North Portland and is bordered by Cathedral Park, St. Johns, University Park and Linnton neighborhoods. University Park is a neighborhood that doesn't dazzle with grand old houses or sculpted greenery or cafes with colorful facades and outside seating. This is a community of nice, modest houses and the students and families who reside in them, a place of straight and relatively quiet streets frequented by bicyclists who prefer a residential area to ride through rather than brave the velocity and vehicle exhaust of North Lombard Street, the busy commercial thoroughfare that serves as this neighborhood's northern boundary.%0a%3c %0a%3c University Park is the home of the University of Portland, the well-known private Catholic school highly regarded by its students. The presence of the school in the community accounts for the high percentage of homes rented. Astor Elementary School is nearby, in the center of the neighborhood. McKenna Park and Portsmouth Park are only a few blocks apart on North Princeton Street, perfect for a game of catch or a walk with the dog.  As a result of the Portland real estate market boom and like many other Portland neighborhoods, University Park has seen an influx of new residents to the area. As one might imagine, University Park has some wonderful areas with nicely improved homes and neighborhoods and some still in transition.%0a%3c University Park is home to one of the oldest schools in the area, the University of Portland.  There is a large student population and much of the area feels young and vibrant. Adidas Corporation is a large area employer as is the Swan Island industrial area.  Commuters here have many options: a quick and easy bike ride to downtown via bike lane nearly the whole way, great mass transit options via bus and the Max light rail train located on Interstate Avenue and a 10 minute drive to downtown Portland via car.   Young, old, singletons and families all call this neighborhood home. There is a large student population in this neighborhood due to University of Portland. This is an active, outdoorsy area- rain or shine guarantees you will see bikers, runners and dog walkers on Willamette.  University Park is comprised of mostly modest homes with architectural styles such as Portland's Craftsman style Bungalow, Cottages, Old Portland, Victorian, Foursquare and other mid-sized, one and two story homes.%0a---%0a> University Park is a neighborhood in the north section of Portland. It borders the neighborhoods of Cathedral Park, Portsmouth, and Overlook. To the southwest side is the Willamette River. %0a> %0a> The neighborhood is home to the University of Portland, a private catholic college. The school is noted for its powerful women’s soccer team that are always ranked among the top teams in the nation. Although the campus, sitting on the south side of the neighborhood overlooking the river, is attractive and serene the area is most definitely not a “college neighborhood.” Where are the pubs, coffee shops, and other student related businesses? The problem is that there’s no town center where people can congregate and walk. Instead, you have to drive from establishment to establishment.%0a> %0a> The northern border of University Park is the high traffic (mainly trucks) Lombard Street. Lombard is the main road through North Portland between I-5 and the St. Johns neighborhood. Along the road, you will see paycheck cashing outlets and bars along with fast food restaurants with a few other businesses. The Java Bean, 4823 N. Lombard Street, is the place to stop for a latte, pastry, and a chat.%0a> %0a> University Park has seen an influx of new residents to the area as the housing prices are low enough to attract first-time buyers, many who are ambitious about remodeling their home. University Park has a handful of classic homes and those are mainly Queen Ann Victorians and Colonials. Most of the homes are on small lots. Surprisingly, there are no apartment houses as the University of Portland students all live on campus or in homes. So University Park now has some areas with improved homes and neighborhoods and some still in transition. Most homes were built after WWII.%0a

It occupies a narrow strip of land around a levee between the Columbia River (North Portland Harbor) and Bridgeton Slough.%0a%3c %0a%3c In 1907, a one-room schoolhouse, the Columbia School, was constructed in the area. Between 1915 and 1930, housing was developed in the area, which was the terminus of the Vancouver Interurban streetcar line. The Faloma post office served the area from August 13, 1921, to June 15, 1935; the USGS still uses this name for the place. Local citizens chose this from the initials of three local landowners (Force, Love and Moore) after the United States Postal Service rejected Bridgeton as too common.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Bridgeton Neighborhood Association was formed in March 1992 to deal with crime and traffic issues, and shortly thereafter was instrumental in defeating a rezoning request for a superstore to be constructed nearby%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

The wide main channel of the Columbia (and the Washington/Oregon state line) passes north of the island. To the south, sheltered by the island, is a smaller channel known as North Portland Harbor. Much of Hayden Island (and connected Tomahawk Island to the east) is within Portland city limits, and recognized as one of its 95 neighborhoods.%0a%3c %0a%3c Interstate 5 provides the only roadway connection to the island, via the northernmost Oregon exit, to the rest of North Portland and, with the Interstate Bridge, to Vancouver to the north. The BNSF Railway crosses North Portland Harbor (via the Oregon Slough Railroad Bridge) and the western part of the island to the west of I-5, before crossing the Columbia via the Burlington Northern Railroad Bridge 9.6. The east end of the island, often called Jantzen Beach, has highly developed retail areas near the freeway, hotels, offices, manufactured home communities, and condominium complexes. Further east there are several houseboat moorages and marinas.%0a%3c %0a%3c Until the Interstate Bridge opened in 1917 ferries provided service between Portland and Vancouver from landings on the island's north shore. After the opening of the bridge, streetcar service opened Hayden Island to amusement park developments due to its beaches and strategic location. Jantzen Beach, the last operating amusement park, closed in 1970. Tomahawk Island, just off the east tip of Hayden Island, became another amusement park—Lotus Isle—for a few years in the 1930s.%0a%3c %0a%3c Because Oregon does not have a state sales tax, and Washington has one of the higher state sales taxes, it is common practice for people in Southwest Washington to travel to Oregon for larger taxable purchases. The Jantzen Beach Shopping Center and many hotels populate this part of the island. A narrow neck of land connects Hayden Island to Tomahawk Island (not an independent island since construction of the linkage), which has numerous marinas, yacht clubs, and the Yacht Harbor Club apartment community.%0a%3c %0a%3c The west side of the island (in unincorporated Multnomah County) is as yet undeveloped, though it was added to the urban growth boundary by voters in 1983. The Port of Portland purchased the land in 1993 with the intention of building a large cargo facility. Metro, the regional government, has designated West Hayden Island as both high value regionally significant habitat and an industrial land. Environmental activists have successfully blocked annexation for industrial development in 1999. But the Port of Portland renewed efforts to annex West Hayden Island in 2008 and Portland City Council voted July 29, 2010 to go forward with an analysis of annexation that would allow 300 acres (1.2 km2) for an undetermined port facility and preserve the remaining 500 acres (2.0 km2) as a protected natural area.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

The neighborhood was originally a company town founded in 1911 for the Swift Meat Packing Company.  Kenton's northern border is formed by North Portland Harbor, the channel of the Columbia River that separates the area from Hayden Island. Kenton's eastern boundary is Interstate 5 and the neighborhood's southern edge is defined by North Lombard Street. The western border (traveling from north to south, respectively) follows North Portland Road, North Columbia Boulevard, and North Chautauqua Boulevard. The Columbia Slough passes through Kenton.%0a%3c %0a%3c Neighborhoods bordering Kenton are: Hayden Island to the north; Bridgeton, Sunderland, and Piedmont to the east; Arbor Lodge to the south; University Park to the southwest; and Portsmouth and St. Johns to the west.%0a%3c %0a%3c Kenton is home to the Portland International Raceway and the Portland Metropolitan Expo Center. The historic site of Vanport, a public housing project built to provide homes for World War II shipbuilders, later destroyed by a 1948 flood, is also located within the current boundaries of the Kenton neighborhood.  Before the 1900s, Kenton was a farming community similar to other townships in the area like University Park and St. Johns until it became a company town built by the Swift Meat Packing Company. By 1910, US$120,000 worth of buildings had been erected in the neighborhood with many fashioned out of concrete and brick. Two three-story brick hotels were built in Kenton in 1910. Plants from companies like the National Wood Pipe Company, Davis Safe and Lock Company, Union Meat Company and Portland Union Stockyards called Kenton home. A concrete apartment building was built by C. H. Carey costing US$22,000. In 1909, Portland, Oregon Mayor Joseph Simon took an automobile trip to Kenton where he announced general improvements for the community like road pavement, street lamps and a fire station. The streets were still dirt in 1910, leading the Kenton Push Club to lobby the Portland City Council to pass a bond to pave the roads. After a long fight with the city council, the roads were paved in 1911. By 1913, US$300,000 had been spent on paving the streets of Kenton. The growing community soon demanded a park, library and schoolhouse. Just a few years later, Kenton was annexed with St. Johns by the City of Portland, becoming home to Portland's main stockyards and the center of the West Coast cattle trade for a time.%0a%3c %0a%3c A story of the "Kenton ghost" was published in the January 5, 1913 edition of The Oregonian which recounted several residents accounts of a shadowy figure lurking the streets of the community. Several prominent citizens came forward with their own sightings of the ghost including the secretary of the Interstate Bridge Commission. Former Albina, Oregon Mayor W. M. Killingsworth led a group of people who looked for the ghost. Kenton had a semi-professional baseball team in 1916 and 1917. The Kenton Giants played in the Inter-City League with three other teams.%0a%3c %0a%3c The 1959 Oregon Centennial celebrations were held in Kenton.To commemorate the occasion, a large statue of Paul Bunyan was built at the intersection of North Interstate Avenue and North Argyle Street (just north of Kenton's historic business district on North Denver Avenue) as a reminder of centennial festivities. The statue still stands at the corner of North Interstate and North Denver, across from the Kenton/N Denver Ave light rail station, and is considered a symbol of the neighborhood. The statue was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 28, 2009. Directly across N Denver Ave from the Paul Bunyan Statue are the four blue hooves of Babe the Blue Ox, his trusted animal companion%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

The original subdivision, now known as “Historic Piedmont,” includes parts of the Humboldt and King neighborhoods, as well as the modern Piedmont neighborhood south of Rosa Parks Way. It is bordered by these neighborhoods:  East Columbia to the north, Woodlawn to the east, Humboldt to the south, and Arbor Lodge along with Kenton to the west.%0a%3c %0a%3c Peninsula Park is just a hint of what’s blooming in the Piedmont neighborhood, bordered by Interstate 5, Northeast Columbia Boulevard, Northeast Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and North Ainsworth Street. It’s a neighborhood in transition, with new affordable home developments being built, older houses being remodeled, and the Interstate MAX light-rail line just a few blocks west. It’s a convenient commute to downtown Portland and just take minutes by car or public transportation.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Piedmont subdivision was one of the early streetcar suburbs so when the Interstate MAX light-rail arrived in 2004, the neighborhood revisited its past.%0a%3c %0a%3c Peninsula Park was originally the site of Liverpool Liz’s Place, a roadhouse and horse-racing track. The 16-acre plot of land was purchased by the city in 1909 and reconfigured as a grand city park by noted architects Ellis Lawrence and Ormond Bean. The park, its Italian-style community center, and rose gardens, opened to the public in 1913. The rose gardens were a big hit, drawing 300,000 visitors in their first year. The octagonal bandstand overlooking the rose garden was constructed in 1913. It was used for World War I patriotic demonstrations and is now the site for many summer weddings and concerts. This wonderful gazebo-like structure is a National Heritage historical structure and was designated a Portland Historic Landmark in 1973. It is the last of its kind in Portland.%0a%3c %0a%3c In 1947, after a failed attempt to build a NABISCO factory in the Rose City Park neighborhood, a factory location along Columbia Boulevard was chosen. The plant was completed in August 1950.  In the book, The Zombie Survival Guide by Max Brooks, there is a faux zombie attack recorded in which zombies attacked Piedmont and the citizens attempt to hide in the cave mines.

It was a separate, incorporated city from 1902 until 1915, when citizens of both St. Johns and Portland voted to approve its annexation to Portland, which took effect on July 8, 1915.%0a%3c %0a%3c St. Johns is bordered by the Columbia River to the northeast, the Willamette River to the northwest, and the North Portland railroad to the southeast. The Cathedral Park neighborhood – which is home to the St. Johns Bridge, the only suspension bridge in the Willamette Valley – lies to the southwest.[3] The main business district of St. Johns (referred to as "Downtown" or "Deep St. Johns") is around the intersection of Lombard and Philadelphia Streets.%0a%3c %0a%3c St. Johns and North Portland are known for their proximity to natural habitats. There are many parks and natural areas in St. Johns, including Pier Park, the Columbia Slough, Kelley Point Park (1984), Pier Park (1959), the Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area (1961), not to mention that it is near Cathedral Park and Baltimore Woods in the Cathedral Park Neighborhood and right across the river from Forest Park. Upon entering St. Johns there is a conspicuously placed sign in the traffic median which says, "Welcome to the Peninsula, Gateway to Nature". Sightings of bald eagles and other birds of prey are common.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

It borders the neighborhoods of Cathedral Park, Portsmouth, and Overlook. To the southwest side is the Willamette River. %0a%3c %0a%3c The neighborhood is home to the University of Portland, a private catholic college. The school is noted for its powerful women’s soccer team that are always ranked among the top teams in the nation. Although the campus, sitting on the south side of the neighborhood overlooking the river, is attractive and serene the area is most definitely not a “college neighborhood.” Where are the pubs, coffee shops, and other student related businesses? The problem is that there’s no town center where people can congregate and walk. Instead, you have to drive from establishment to establishment.%0a%3c %0a%3c The northern border of University Park is the high traffic (mainly trucks) Lombard Street. Lombard is the main road through North Portland between I-5 and the St. Johns neighborhood. Along the road, you will see paycheck cashing outlets and bars along with fast food restaurants with a few other businesses. The Java Bean, 4823 N. Lombard Street, is the place to stop for a latte, pastry, and a chat.%0a%3c %0a%3c University Park has seen an influx of new residents to the area as the housing prices are low enough to attract first-time buyers, many who are ambitious about remodeling their home. University Park has a handful of classic homes and those are mainly Queen Ann Victorians and Colonials. Most of the homes are on small lots. Surprisingly, there are no apartment houses as the University of Portland students all live on campus or in homes. So University Park now has some areas with improved homes and neighborhoods and some still in transition. Most homes were built after WWII.%0a---%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
