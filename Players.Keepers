This family friendly neighborhood draws attention of corrupting spirits like the Blightlings (Iri Thim). Only if a city falls to ruin will the Iri Thim be able to truly feed. The pack has settled here to keep this from happening. No matter how much they attempt to blend with the populous, the Uratha is always an outsider. Uratha, Iron Masters in particular, desire fruits of socializing and mingling with humanity, but that is an impossibility, because they have to walk the fine line between the spirit and humanity. Multnomah has the promise of being everything that a home should be. A home that the Uratha desire to have. This is a Utopian idea that not all Uratha’s or Pack in general share, but this pack is different. Why not strive for a Utoptia to call home? This community is not only a place, but an idea, or even a philosophy for the Uratha, which makes it sacred.Here the pack can have a future. Multnomah, even the idea of it, keeps the Uratha coming back from the Hisil after The Hunt time, time and again.The community keeps pack grounded in humanity, which keeps their Harmony in control.%0a%0a!!!!!Turbulent Waters (Spiritual Touchstone):%0aThe Hisil has its own calling that Uratha must follow. This pack has a little more trouble resisting the desire to enter the Hisil to hunt. Halluc the Dagukurum (Swift Water) river spirit is the source of this troublesome temptation. The river spirit has an insatiable hunger for the Essense of spirits. Halluc reminds them of what it means to be Uratha, to be part spirit. Guiding the pack through the Shadow on hunts to bring down bigger and bigger prey, so the spirit can feast and grow large. Taking the pack on these Siskur-Dah leads the Uratha further and further away from humanity. The Sacred Hunt keeps the Uratha in touch with their spirit side, which is healthy, but too much of a good thing can be damaging to Harmony and throw the werewolf out of balance. It takes a firm, but wisdom hand to deal with such a ravenous spirit. Is the Pack up to the challenge?%0a%0a!!!!!Complications:%0aWhat threatens the potential for Multnomah to become an Uratha Utopia is progress. Too much progress and the community will change to drastically. Too little progress and it will wither and die. The Uratha have to nurture maybe even guide the community if they are to have Multnomah meet their vision for the future. The Blightlings (Iri Thim) in the area are hungry, but there isn’t much to feed on within Multnomah. These spirits are working hard to cause this part of the city to fall into ruin. Only when it is in ruins can the Iri Thim actually feed. The pack stands in their way though and has made an enemy of the these spirits of decay.%0a%0a(:table:)%0a(:cellnr align=center colspan=2:) '''%25werewolf%25TERRITORY'''%0a(:cellnr align=left colspan=2:) ''%25werewolf%25MULTNOMAH'' (Still waiting on approval from ST)%0a(:cellnr align=left colspan=2:) Neighborhood in the Southwest section of Portland, Oregon, centered on the Multnomah Village business district.
