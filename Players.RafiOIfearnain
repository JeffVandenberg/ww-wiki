She has colorful language, she always chooses seats that put her back to the wall, watches her surroundings like the guarded minx she is.  She is a half feral creature that is not terribly well socialized!%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25werewolf%25 ''A Foot in the Other (Werewolves, appropriate spiritual entities)'': %0a%3c Rafi sees what is hidden to most, her piercing eyes breaking the veil to always see what's flitting about.  The two worlds juxtaposed can sometimes be confusing, can sometimes make her forget which one is 'real', giving her a distracted, slightly spacey vibe.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25werewolf%25 ''Waystone (Werewolves and others who might detect a locus)'': %0a%3c Rafi is a sort of vortex where the line between Flesh and Spirit is weak. Spirits and creatures of flesh that seek the Twilight tend to be drawn to the Wolf-Blooded unconsciously.  She acts as a one dot locus.%0a---%0a> !!!!%25werewolf%25 ''Hook 1(Who it effects)''%0a> Hook info here%0a> %0a> !!!!%25werewolf%25 ''Hook 2(Who it effects)'': %0a> Hook info here%0a> %0a> !!!!%25werewolf%25 ''Hook 3(Who it effects)'': %0a> Hook info here%0a
