Dark raven black hair, deep red lips, dark black eye makeup. And milky white skin. The quintessential goth, with her sultry, dark looks she could easily be a model. Tall, but not too tall, with a curvy, yet fit figure, that is often accentuated even more so by the corsets she wears. Giving her even more an hourglass shape. It is rare to see her in colors, her wardrobe seems to come in one color, black. With perhaps a shade of dark blood red and deep purple here and there. Her nails most often painted black. Her pale skin seems untouched by ink, but she does possess a few facial piercings.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Mien''%0a%0a%25center%25Liliana's Mein doesn't differ a whole lot from her mask, except in a few ways. Her skin is far, far, far more pale. So pale it has a gray pearlescence to it. Her lips are a dark deep red, that match her eyes, which glow ever so slightly. Her nails end in perfect sharp deep blood red points. And her hair is a deep black, like shadows. She looks like the perfect image of a vampire from myths and legends. A hauntingly beautiful creature of darkness. Her voice hauntingly sweet, and her touch icy cold. %0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Mantle''%0a%0a%25center%25Those in the Gravewright's presence feel an unnatural and unsettling chill.
