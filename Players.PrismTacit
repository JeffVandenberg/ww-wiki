One of her eyes is bluish gray while the other is an olive green, perhaps this is what makes her look a bit striking. Or maybe it is her hair that is nearly platinum blonde and often worn with a gray beanie over it with her hair flairing out. Her skin is nearly a pale ivory when it is clean and not possibly covered from living off the land so to speak. Her body looks slightly malnourished but she still have her womanly curves, if you can tell through her baggy clothing. Her movement suggest she wasn't always on the streets, more so she was once an entertainer.%0a%0a----%0a!!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Hooks'''%0a%0a!!!!%25mortal%25 ''The Big Top(All)":%0aShe once was he Fabulous Fearless Flying Prism Tacit, the Amazing Acrobat, perhaps you recognize her from when she toured within the past few years? %0a%0a!!!!%25mortal%25 ''Street Performer(All)":%0aEven though she has a more normal-ish job, she stilll adores the thrill of perform her ground gymnastics for passing crowds.%0a%0a!!!!%25mortal%25 ''Fast Metabolism(All)":%0aSince she once was living on the streets a couple of years after the circus shut down, she is still always hungry and does indeed have a fast metabolism.%0a%0a!!!!%25mortal%25 ''Running(All)":%0aShe loves to do it, though usually to get away from possible danger but still.

Or maybe it is her hair that is nearly platinum blonde and often worn with a gray beanie over it with her hair flairing out. Her skin is nearly a pale ivory when it is clean and not possibly covered from living off the land so to speak. Her body looks slightly malnourished but she still have her womanly curves, if you can tell through her baggy clothing.
