One of her eyes is bluish-gray while the other is an olive green, perhaps this is what makes her look a bit striking. Or maybe it is her hair that is nearly platinum blonde and often worn with a gray beanie over it with her hair flaring out. Her skin is nearly a pale ivory when it is clean and not possibly covered from living off the land so to speak. Her body looks athletic but she still has her womanly curves. Her movement suggests she wasn't always on the streets, more so she was once an entertainer.%0a(:div2end:)%0a!!%25center%25%25color=#FF96A5%25'''The Personality'''%0a%25center%25She is often described as bubbly, friendly and curious. That curiosity and her naivety often leads to very intriguing and unique friendships. The side that is rarely seen however is her temper, though rumor has it, when it does explode, she is a firecracker. %0a(:div2end:)%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=10px border='2px solid #6e68a3' width=205 margin-right=0px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=10px newwin%25https://i.imgur.com/MARC9UR.jpg%0a!!%25center%25%25color=#FF96A5%25'''Ruvi the Beloved Pet '''%0a%25center%25Prism now has a new companion she brings everyone named Ruvi. He is a three-month-old puppy of the Leonberger breed. She rescued him from a shelter and seems inseparable now from the sweet and wiggly puppy. He adores giving kisses and is mostly well behaved. The commands he responds to may not be recognized by most, however. He even has a little vest that she sometimes puts on him that reads: Service Dog In Training.%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25color=#FF96A5%25'''Life Before and within the Circus'''%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=10px border='2px solid #6e68a3' width=185 margin-right=0px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=10px newwin%25https://i.imgur.com/6sBkI1a.jpg%0aThe story of the girl now called Prism Tacit is very much atypical. She was born to a reckless woman who had no plans on ever being a parent. She never had a maternal bone in her body. So upon the steps of an orphanage, baby Prism was left after the doors were heavily knocked up before the woman took off. The orphanage was a cruel place that would use the child for labor behind the government's backs.  %0a%0aAfter many attempts, she was able to finally run away at the age of 10 without getting caught. She snuck on board the circus train and the ringmaster found her being held up by one of the elephants. She was told either go home or join, so she lied about her age to join the circus. For three years she rigorously trained for performance aerial acrobatics on the trapeze as well as the high wire balancing act. At age 13 she was allowed to start performing for audiences and fell in love with being in the spotlight. %0a%0aEventually, the lie about her age was discovered but she was one of the headlining acts and the ringmaster overlooked such details. Over in Europe, the circus thrived but then the trip to America came and the tour only lasted a year before the ringmaster had to close it down permanently.%0a!!%25center%25%25color=#FF96A5%25'''After the Big Top and eventual arrival in Miami'''%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=10px border='2px solid #6e68a3' width=195 margin-right=0px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=10px newwin%25https://i.imgur.com/rH0QH47.jpg%0aWith the fact she no longer had her job in the circus, no one did, she had to accept a life of living on the streets. She had snuck into the country and had no work visa. Slowly she began to develop a talent for stealing as well as breaking into places. Over the next two years of living on the street, she was able to hone her skills and quickly get better at surviving without the aid of others. Slowly making her way down from the Northern states and eventually winding up in Miami at the beginning of 2020. %0a%0aAnd luck just seemed to change with that new year ringing in, or perhaps karma decided to reward this waifish, once famous acrobat with good fortune. It was within the first week of arriving to this southern Florida city that she managed to meet Nero and get hired to work at his shop while teaching her how to read English. %0a!!%25center%25%25color=#FF96A5%25'''The Blissful Now'''%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=10px border='2px solid #6e68a3' width=265 margin-right=0px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=10px newwin%25https://i.imgur.com/ObGTbR9.jpg%0a%25color=#E496FF%25Johnny. %25color=#96E3FF%25Johnny. %25color=#96FFB2%25Johnny. %25color=#FF96B8%25Johnny. %25color=#D9FF96%25Johnny. %25color=#FFC796%25Johnny. %25color=#96ADFF%25Johnny. %25color=#96FFDC%25Johnny. %25color=#CF96FF%25Johnny. %25color=#FF9698%25Johnny. %25color=#A5FF96%25Johnny. %25color=#C096FF%25Johnny. %25color=#FFAA96%25Johnny. %25color=#FF96FF%25Johnny. %25color=#E496FF%25Johnny. %25color=#96E3FF%25Johnny. %25color=#96FFB2%25Johnny. %25color=#FF96B8%25Johnny. %25color=#D9FF96%25Johnny. %25color=#FFC796%25Johnny. %25color=#96ADFF%25Johnny. %25color=#96FFDC%25Johnny. %25color=#CF96FF%25Johnny. %25color=#FF9698%25Johnny. %25color=#A5FF96%25Johnny. %25color=#C096FF%25Johnny. %25color=#FFAA96%25Johnny. %25color=#FF96FF%25Johnny. %25color=#E496FF%25Johnny. %25color=#96E3FF%25Johnny. %25color=#96FFB2%25Johnny. %25color=#FF96B8%25Johnny. %25color=#D9FF96%25Johnny. %25color=#FFC796%25Johnny. %25color=#96ADFF%25Johnny. %25color=#96FFDC%25Johnny. %25color=#CF96FF%25Johnny. %25color=#FF9698%25Johnny. %25color=#A5FF96%25Johnny. %25color=#C096FF%25Johnny. %25color=#FFAA96%25Johnny. %25color=#FF96FF%25Johnny.%0a%0aA peek into the mind of the ghoul would reveal that Prism sees her new life through immensely rose-tinted glasses and she embraces the unique companionship she has with her kindred. Whether it is just the blood bond or something more to make her feel so strongly for her regnant is hard to tell but it is evident in how she speaks of him so fondly. And she soaks up the gifts he gives her often. And when he is busy she often keeps herself busy either acquiring things she wants or spending time with her beloved new pet dog Ruvi. A gift from Nero, a Leonberger puppy they located at the pound and she does not often leave home without him. And between all those wonderful things she acquired her work visa somehow and a closet filled with many a pretty gown as well as her more mundane street clothes and longs to hear him playing on one of his instruments once more. Not to mention fun trips to the swamps to hang with her new friends. The pattern upon the quilt that represents her life growing more and more intricate with each passing day. %0a(:div2end:)%0a---%0a!!%25center%25%25color=#FF96A5%25'''Hooks'''%0a!!!!%25color=#FF96A5%25 ''Black Books (All)":%0aShe acquired a job there during the day shift at the beginning of the year and can be found sometimes lingering there even after she is off on the clock.

That curiosity and her naivety often leads to very intriguing and unique friendships. The side that is rarely seen however is her temper, though rumor has it, when it does explode, it is much like a firecracker. %0a77c77%0a%3c A peek into the mind of the ghoul would reveal that Prism sees her new life through immensely rose-tinted glasses and she embraces the unique companionship she has with her kindred. Whether it is just the blood bond or something more to make her feel so strongly for her regnant is hard to tell but it is evident in how she speaks of him so fondly. And she soaks up the gifts he gives her often. And when he is busy she often keeps herself busy either acquiring things she wants or spending time with her beloved new pet dog Ruvi. A gift from Nero, a Leonberger puppy they located at the pound and she does not often leave home without him. And between all those wonderful things she acquired her work visa somehow and a closet filled with many a pretty gown as well as her more mundane street clothes and longs to hear him playing on one of his instruments once more. Not to mention fun trips to the swamps to hang with her new friends. The pattern upon the quilt that represents her life growing more and more intricate with each passing day. %0a---%0a> %0a

She was born to a reckless woman who had no plans on ever being a parent. She never had a maternal bone in her body. So upon the steps of an orphanage, baby Prism was left after the doors were heavily knocked up before the woman took off. The orphanage was a cruel place that would use the child for labor behind the government's backs.  %0a%3c %0a%3c After many attempts, she was able to finally run away at the age of 10 without getting caught. She snuck on board the circus train and the ringmaster found her being held up by one of the elephants. She was told either go home or join, so she lied about her age to join the circus. For three years she rigorously trained for performance aerial acrobatics on the trapeze as well as the high wire balancing act. At age 13 she was allowed to start performing for audiences and fell in love with being in the spotlight. %0a%3c %0a%3c Eventually, the lie about her age was discovered but she was one of the headlining acts and the ringmaster overlooked such details. Over in Europe, the circus thrived but then the trip to America came and the tour only lasted a year before the ringmaster had to close it down permanently.%0a%3c !!%25center%25%25color=#FF96A5%25'''After the Big Top and eventual arrival in Miami'''%0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=10px border='2px solid #6e68a3' width=185 margin-right=0px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=10px newwin%25https://i.imgur.com/6sBkI1a.jpg%0a%3c With the fact she no longer had her job in the circus, no one did, she had to accept a life of living on the streets. She had snuck into the country and had no work visa. Slowly she began to develop a talent for stealing as well as breaking into places. Over the next two years of living on the street, she was able to hone her skills and quickly get better at surviving without the aid of others. Slowly making her way down from the Northern states and eventually winding up in Miami at the beginning of 2020. %0a%3c %0a%3c And luck just seemed to change with that new year ringing in, or perhaps karma decided to reward this waifish, once famous acrobat with good fortune. It was within the first week of arriving to this southern Florida city that she managed to meet Nero and get hired to work at his shop while teaching her how to read English. %0a%3c

One of her eyes is bluish gray while the other is an olive green, perhaps this is what makes her look a bit striking. Or maybe it is her hair that is nearly platinum blonde and often worn with a gray beanie over it with her hair flairing out. Her skin is nearly a pale ivory when it is clean and not possibly covered from living off the land so to speak. Her body looks slightly malnourished but she still have her womanly curves, if you can tell through her baggy clothing. Her movement suggest she wasn't always on the streets, more so she was once an entertainer.%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c (:div2end:)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Contacts'''%0a%3c %0a%3c ||! %25mortal%25Image ||! %25mortal%25Name ||! %25mortal%25Relationship ||! %25mortal%25Comment ||! %25mortal%25Ringtone ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c %0a%3c (:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Hooks'''%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25mortal%25 ''The Big Top(All)":%0a%3c She once was a very respected acrobat, perhaps you recognize her from when she toured within the past few years?%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25mortal%25 ''Homeless(All)":%0a%3c She had somewhere to stay but she felt like more a burden than a help.
