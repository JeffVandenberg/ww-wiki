One of her eyes is bluish gray while the other is an olive green, perhaps this is what makes her look a bit striking. Or maybe it is her hair that is nearly platinum blonde and often worn with a gray beanie over it with her hair flairing out. Her skin is nearly a pale ivory when it is clean and not possibly covered from living off the land so to speak. Her body looks slightly malnourished but she still have her womanly curves, if you can tell through her baggy clothing. Her movement suggest she wasn't always on the streets, more so she was once an entertainer.%0a%0a----%0a!!%25center%25%25color=#FF96A5%25'''Hooks'''%0a%0a!!!!%25color=#FF96A5%25 ''Black Books (All)":%0aShe acquired a job there during the day shift at the beginning of the year and can be found sometimes lingering there even after she is off on the clock. It may be becoming a more digital world, but sometimes you physically need something rare, unusual, or long-out-of-print. %0a%0a!!!!%25color=#FF96A5%25 ''Ghoul (Vampire)":%0aShe is new to being a ghoul but it learning as quickly as she is allowed. %0a%0a!!!!%25color=#FF96A5%25 ''The Big Top(All)":%0aShe once was the Fabulous Fearless Flying Prism Tacit, the Amazing Acrobat, perhaps you recognize her from when she toured within the past few years? %0a%0a!!!!%25color=#FF96A5%25 ''Street Performer(All)":%0aEven though she has a more normal-ish job, she stilll adores the thrill of perform her ground gymnastics for passing crowds.%0a%0a!!!!%25color=#FF96A5%25 ''Fast Metabolism(All)":%0aSince she once was living on the streets a couple of years after the circus shut down, she is still always hungry and does indeed have a fast metabolism.%0a%0a!!!!%25color=#FF96A5%25 ''Running(All)":%0aShe loves to do it, though usually to get away from possible danger but still. It is a great past time.%0a%0a!!!!%25color=#FF96A5%25 ''No Touchie!(All)":%0aShe hates, /HATES/, being touched. She will be quick to run should someone attempt affection. Very closed-lipped as to why. Though as one gets to know her, or she feels a connection with someone, she tends to not be so upset about it.%0a%0a!!!!%25color=#FF96A5%25 ''Russian(All)":%0aShe is from Tolyatti. A very poor city in the southern part of Russia.%0a%0a!!!!%25color=#FF96A5%25 ''Illiterate(All)":%0aShe can't read English but can speak it conversationally well enough.

One of her eyes is bluish gray while the other is an olive green, perhaps this is what makes her look a bit striking. Or maybe it is her hair that is nearly platinum blonde and often worn with a gray beanie over it with her hair flairing out. Her skin is nearly a pale ivory when it is clean and not possibly covered from living off the land so to speak. Her body looks slightly malnourished but she still have her womanly curves, if you can tell through her baggy clothing. Her movement suggest she wasn't always on the streets, more so she was once an entertainer.%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c (:div2end:)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Contacts'''%0a%3c %0a%3c ||! %25mortal%25Image ||! %25mortal%25Name ||! %25mortal%25Relationship ||! %25mortal%25Comment ||! %25mortal%25Ringtone ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c %0a%3c (:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Hooks'''%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25mortal%25 ''The Big Top(All)":%0a%3c She once was a very respected acrobat, perhaps you recognize her from when she toured within the past few years?%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25mortal%25 ''Homeless(All)":%0a%3c She had somewhere to stay but she felt like more a burden than a help.
