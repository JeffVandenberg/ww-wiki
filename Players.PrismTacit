One of her eyes is bluish gray while the other is an olive green, perhaps this is what makes her look a bit striking. Or maybe it is her hair that is nearly platinum blonde and often worn with a gray beanie over it with her hair flairing out. Her skin is nearly a pale ivory when it is clean and not possibly covered from living off the land so to speak. Her body looks slightly malnourished but she still have her womanly curves, if you can tell through her baggy clothing.
