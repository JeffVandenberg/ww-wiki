She doesn't know why but she never questioned it.  Now she is at dock for repairs and to explore the area to see if its worth staying.\\%0a%3c \\%0a%3c HOOKS\\%0a%3c \\%0a%3c New to Town(Any): Shaila is new to town with her retainer Kadesh\\%0a%3c \\%0a%3c Captain (any): Shaila is the captain of the ship Duchess\\%0a%3c \\%0a---%0a> She had told her mothers about this and they would start to tell her tales of what they had seen in their time "outside" None of the tales were very nice and they seemed to make the outside look so bad to Shaila that it was a few more years before she even thought about it again. But when she did the mothers once again told her the tales only this time Shaila rebuffed everyone saying" Well if that were me.. I would have....". The mothers seemed a bit impressed. The head mother walked up to Shaila and softly kissed her forehead ~ Now it begins..~ At first Shaila didn't understand. She rarely saw head mother since she had always been gone during the day. Just before the evening meal Shaila was summoned to her father. She did not know father was even back so she quickly made her way to her father. When she saw him she hugged him happily, then remembered who it was that she was hugging and quickly bowed before the Sultan. Her Father sat down on the mound of colorful pillows and looked at her for the longest time.. then he started to tell her something that was so extraordinary that she could do nothing but sit and stare at him~%0a> %0a> ~Head mother was her true mother. And when father had accepted Head Mother as his wife...they had struck a bargain. Head mother would have a tent of her own, where ever she wished, and once a month she would come to Fathers tent. In return for her obedience to father, Upon the birth of a girl child, their contract to each other would cease. Head Mother would watch over the raising and the care of the child, but when the child longed for something more and no words will dissuade her, she will run with Head Mother and learn from her. Only seeing her father... when she wished. It appears that last night was that time. Normally she would question why her father would agree to such a thing, but she truly wanted to go and learn from her "true" mother. Once all was told to her, her father looked upon her like she his daughter. ~ Shaila, I do not wish you to go. But your eyes tell me you wish to. Be wise in the teachings, and listen to each word from your mother. She is a wise woman and still very much beautiful. ~ Nodding she makes her way out of his tent and runs to her own. SHE WAS FREE!!!! She was going to leave the gardens she was going to be able to run with the others and not get talked down to and not made to feel the fool and...oh wait a minute.. where exactly is Mother taking me..this made her steps slow as she walked into her tent. Looking around at the other mother's her eyes start to water. She would be leaving her mothers behind. How could she leave them behind?? These were her mothers.. they raised her and taught her how to be. Clearly the mothers knew what she was feeling because they got up one by one, laid a silk scarf around her neck, and softly kissed her cheek as they left the tent. Her soft golden eyes remained open as she watched which mother laid which scarf upon her arm. When it was the second mother's turn she stopped and looked at her. Laying down a royal purple scarf on her arm, she then takes off her head piece of gold and puts it upon her head~ Never take this off my sweet daughter. This is yours for as long as the day and night merges. We will always be with you.~ Kissing her cheek softly after putting the head piece on, the second mother walked out of the tent leaving Shaila alone for the very first time. She looked around the now empty tent and saw silks of the most beautiful colors and pillows all around her. Closing her eyes she stands there for a few moments hugging the scarves that she holds in her hands and crying softly.%0a> %0a> Feeling arms wrap around her, she looks up and sees head mother....her mother. Wrapped in her mothers arms she felt safe. Then she heard soft choked words come from her mother ~ Never let them see you cry daughter. That is a sign of weakness and very much frowned upon. ~Shaila nodded and wiped her tears. Gathering what things she wished to take, she walked out of the tent and out of the garden gates without saying goodbye to anyone. She would come back and visit. She would see them all again..%0a> %0a> Once they had left the compound, Mother stopped and turned her to look at her. The smile on her face could have lit up the night for Shaila. Her mother approved.. That was worth all the pain. Trying to imagine how she would have felt if it were the other alternative. She lowered her head ashamed of the fact she actually thought about it. Then she heard her mother laugh~ Shaila.. my sweet Shaila.. do not look so ashamed dear one. You are my daughter.. you always think twice over something. ~Mother kisses her head softly then takes her hand~ You need to trust me daughter... All will be better.. you will see.. I promise. ~ Shaila nodded softly and started walking with mother. for two days they walked. Then they came upon a tent made of furs. it was the blackest of furs and for a moment Shaila had thought it was a trick of her eyes. As they walked towards the tent mother seemed to slow her steps.~ Shaila... speak with me for a moment...~Shaila stopped and looked at her mother. What could she possibly want to know that she does not already.... ~%0a> %0a> Mother: What do you know of me?%0a> %0a> Shaila: I know you are head mother and my true mother and that I am to learn from you and listen to every word you say.%0a> %0a> Mother:*she smiles* Your fathers orders?%0a> %0a> Shaila: Yes mother.%0a> %0a> Mother: Then you should know more.... I am Sujata, I know how to build, make stone from sand, I can do anything a man can and in some cases, better.%0a> %0a> ~ Shaila's eyes went wide and she took a step back. this was her mother?? this.. woman who thinks she is better than a man? Mother saw her reaction and nodded, not very pleased with her reaction.~ We were not created to be servants and mindless children for men. I know of a woman who rules a country. And the people are happy.%0a> %0a> ~Shaila blinks.. she couldn't believe what her mother was saying... as the sun went down Sujata looked up~ Shaila I am a special woman ~she looks to her daughter and sighs softly~ Tonight I will become even more special. All things I have done, I have done for my daughter so she will do what she knows she must do. You have the eyes of a tiger, use them to help you see. You have the body of a god.. use it to get your way.. seduce if needed, strike when you must.... Soon you will know more than anyone should know, but he does this as a favor... so I may remain, happy.%0a> %0a> ~ Shaila looks at her mother and for the first time since she left with her mother, she started to get scared. When her mother reaches out for her hand, she accepts it and starts walking with her towards the tent.%0a> %0a> Reaching the tent, her mother stops and stands outside. Shaila finds this odd but when she hears movement in the tent her eyes widen slightly. Looking to her mother then to the tent flap then back to her mother she blinks a couple times and jumps slightly when the flaps fly open. Standing there she looks at the man who emerges from the tent. His long black hair was the first that caught her eye, followed by the sea blue eyes and the build of a god.. Shaila immediately lowers her eyes and bows her head in greeting. The man looks to Sujata then Shaila then holds the flap open for them to enter the tent. Both women walk inside silently. As Shaila got inside she couldn't see a thing at first. But as her eyes adjusted, she saw the flickering of a small candle. As mother let go of her hand, Shalia just turned and looked at what she could see. Soon Mother had a fire going in the middle of the tent and she could see things much clearer. This man was very well off...She saw chests of all kinds and things she had never seen before. She turned and looked at both silently. Then she saw the man fully for the first time. He was pale and when he smiled at Sujata he had the teeth of a snake. Her eyes widened in horror as she simply stood there. Her mother hands her a glass of dark red wine and tells her to drink.. Without thought she takes the glass and drinks it all quickly. Seeing the man nod she absently wondered what it was all about.%0a> %0a> Her mother escorted Shaila to her tent. After getting everything settled, Shaila started to take off the head piece that she was given but stopped when she saw herself in the mirror. this was the first time she saw herself....ever. Mother explained to Shaila what it was, and Shaila's eyes widened a bit more... this is what she looks like??? Turning to face herself she tilts her head slightly and looks at herself. Now she knows why second wife told her to never take it off...the head piece seems to set off her eyes making her look... almost dangerous.. she laughed softly and quickly covered her mouth.. everyone knows women are not dangerous...~%0a> %0a> Twenty years had passed and she still appeared quite young.. she had asked mother one time why she looked the same and her mother had told her... that had what started her lessons... each day mother would teach her the life of one who is.. a sultan. Mother taught her how to rule how to make decisions that would benefit the whole and she taught her to read and write and do equations and read ancient languages...she even taught her how to fight... (how cool is that)). Shaila was learning quickly and every night the man would ask Shaila what she had learned during the day. She would tell him all she had learned during dinner and would feel guilty about him not eating because of her talking.%0a> %0a> Until a few months later... one night she had spoken with mother and learned of vampires... she had learned much that night. and at dinner when asked the same question she looked at the man~ I learned nothing...~ she lied.. of course she lied.. Mother taught her speed and that was enough for her. The man looked at her and smiled.. he actually smiled. Looking at Shaila he stands and walks to her mother. Kneeling next to her mother he looks at Shaila~ do you know what her price was for staying alive Shaila?? It was you... and she wanted you out of that mans reach... you are my daughter now and your mother is old...~then she hears her mothers voice~ Go with Michael... ~Shaila starts to say something but before she can her mother stands and walks out of the tent. Looking to Michael.. so thats what his name is....she falls silent and looks at him~ I was going to keep you as a ghoul...~he tells her~ but in view of whats happened... I think you will become my daughter... ~before she could even blink he was pinning her down and biting into her neck.. She felt the exstacy from his "kiss" and she wrapped her arms around his neck as he drank from her. This was a new feeling and she happened to like it, until she felt herself slipping away... trying to hold on but it was too much.... then its as if a bolt went through her body sparking everything back to life... tasting something sweet she goes to the source and softly begins sucking. Opening her golden eyes, she sees Michael's face. Seeing the expression on his face, it encourages her.. she continues drinking the sweet liquid until Michael pushes himself away from her.%0a> %0a> That night was her last night as a mortal. After that Michael taught her how to command people and how to make others stop and stare.. then on the flip.. he taught her how to make them run in fear.. After he felt she was good enough, her taught her sword play and when she was able to hold her own, he packed her a bag of things (including her silk scarves from her mothers) and took her to the ocean. Using his own speed, he grabbed her hand and ran.. It only took a night for them to arrive at the ocean. Getting onto the ship, he leads her down to the belly of the ship and makes sure she is comfortable..%0a> %0a> For the next 150 years, she was a pirate.. she learned their ways and cared for her own ship. The Nightingale.. she would hear stories when she was on land about this woman pirate.. some of them made her laugh at their absurity while others made her cringe....slightly.%0a

Looking to Michael.. so thats what his name is....she falls silent and looks at him~ I was going to keep you as a ghoul...~he tells her~ but in view of whats happened... I think you will become my daughter... ~before she could even blink he was pinning her down and biting into her neck.. She felt the exstacy from his "kiss" and she wrapped her arms around his neck as he drank from her. This was a new feeling and she happened to like it, until she felt herself slipping away... trying to hold on but it was too much.... then its as if a bolt went through her body sparking everything back to life... tasting something sweet she goes to the source and softly begins sucking. Opening her golden eyes, she sees Michael's face. Seeing the expression on his face, it encourages her.. she continues drinking the sweet liquid until Michael pushes himself away from her.%0a%3c %0a%3c That night was her last night as a mortal. After that Michael taught her how to command people and how to make others stop and stare.. then on the flip.. he taught her how to make them run in fear.. After he felt she was good enough, her taught her sword play and when she was able to hold her own, he packed her a bag of things (including her silk scarves from her mothers) and took her to the ocean. Using his own speed, he grabbed her hand and ran.. It only took a night for them to arrive at the ocean. Getting onto the ship, he leads her down to the belly of the ship and makes sure she is comfortable..%0a%3c %0a%3c For the next 150 years, she was a pirate.. she learned their ways and cared for her own ship. The Nightingale.. she would hear stories when she was on land about this woman pirate.. some of them made her laugh at their absurity while others made her cringe....slightly.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> http://bloodwyne.weebly.com/uploads/3/7/7/5/3775865/1164_1_orig.jpg%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
