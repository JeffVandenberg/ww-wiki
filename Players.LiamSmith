He's relatively lean, with the appearance of not having done much physical activity. What is remarkable about Liam, are his piercing steel blue eyes, and his dark hair, always perfectly placed, and moving subtly as if it were under water. He keeps to simple, but elegant attire that has a bit looseness to his frame. Pants wise, he chooses the sort that are made of light material, and of the 'thai harem pants' style, though the inner leg seam is a bit further down. Shoes, when he ever bothers, are the simplest tie on shoes he can manage. %0a%0aLima has a fondness for sparkly things, and has a penchant for collecting jeweled necklaces, bracelets, and other sorts of accessories.%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Mein''%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/8xiXVgH.jpg%0a%25center%25To those who can see who he truly is, Lima's features soften even more than they already are, his steel blue eyes brighten and intensify, until they become far closer to a brilliant, neon cyan, with flecks of gold yellow and sea green. %0a%0aHis dark hair grows lighter and brighter, like the look of coral in sunlight, strands of hair swaying with the ocean current. His lean mass is retained, though sean green and blue scales form along his spine, melding into a coral fin that, often, he keeps flattened into his back. Scales of gold and green cascade down his spine to his tail, forming the edge of an abstract butterfly wing along his hips, touched in deep blues and greens. The scale of his tail slide between greens, blues, and golds, with gentle flecks of coral throughout. When the light hits them just right, they glimmer in a kaleidoscope of colors.%0a%0aAs the tail thins, there are periodical, small bands of coral. The fins at the end discard the blues and greens of the sea, and embrace the coral, with gold flicked throughout the fin. %0a%0aHis tail he often keeps curled within the confines of his chair, unfurling it fully only when the opportunity to swim arises. There is no doubt he finds this deeply uncomfortable, but necessary.%0a%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Mantle''%0a%0a%25center%25There is a stillness to the air surrounding Liam, the way one might imagine the surface of a cool, placid lake.%0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''Contacts'''%0a%0a||! %25changeling%25Image ||! %25changeling%25Name ||! %25changeling%25Relationship ||! %25changeling%25Comment ||! %25changeling%25Ringtone ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''Hooks'''%0a%0a!!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''Bookworm (Everyone)'': %0aLiam has a love of books, one of the few things he remembers clearly.
