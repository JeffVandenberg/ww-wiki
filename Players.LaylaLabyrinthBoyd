A few know that she may still be practicing, just not on the up and up.%0a%0a!!!Dancing by Herself%0aMedicine wasn’t the first calling she abandoned.

One for each life she used her gift to save.  A tally system that left her more and more disfigured over the years.  Her skin a story only she knew, a set of armor, and the first of many gauntlets for strangers to get through.  While her awakening a short while ago turned her skin into a fresh canvas, she's not sure she recognizes this new flawless version of herself.%0a----%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/3jDViPa.gifv%0a----%0a!!Gossip%0a%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='0px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=400px%25 https://i.imgur.com/VU93Doj.jpg%0a%0a%25mortal%25 "I swear that girl is always trying to break my heart.
