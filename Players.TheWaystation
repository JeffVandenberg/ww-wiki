He also knew he had to have a cover.  So he opened up the bar.  It has always been a local place.  From the start it was just one story, what is now the back bar, was originally the members only club.    %0a%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=200px height=200px%25https://i.imgur.com/VfB4Gjt.jpg%0aAs the bar grew, they expanded upwards.  With the help of his packmate, retired accountant Col. Robert H. Montgomery, they made the patio a comfortable place to enjoy the weather.  In the 50's the added on the 2nd & 3rd stories of the building.  Moving the Member's club to the second floor along with a better kitchen. %0aAs David grew older, and got involved in other works, he left the running of the bar to his families wolfblooded.  Picking those who had the tell to know someones ties,  he left them in charge.  While officially the bar has been passed through to different Fairchild blooded, the Family is always the one to pick who it goes too.  Whoever is listed, gets to have the 3rd floor apartment for themselves.  Over the years many blooded have added on to it until it's as you see it now.  The bar has now turned into a sort of hot spot for locals.  Sometimes tourist wander in but that is never the focus group for the bar's clientele.  In the 70's the stage was added, to help invite local bands to give shows.  Most local bands have at least one show there.   Now that [[Gwendolyn Bernhardt|Hart]] owns it, she has invested in a karaoke machine, along with updating the kitchen, stage and the decor.  She has also started having theme sort of nights.  %0a%0a\\%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25color=#008080%25Schedule%0a%0a||! %25teal%25Monday ||! %25teal%25Tuesday ||! %25teal%25Wednesday ||! %25teal%25Thursday ||! %25teal%25Friday ||! %25teal%25Saturday ||! %25teal%25Sunday || %0a|| Himbo Bimbo Limbo || Open Mic Night || 1$ Jello Shots || Karaoke Night || Local Band || DJ Night || Speed Dating ||%0a%0a(:tableend:)   %0a%0a%0a(:table valign=top:)%0a(:cellnr width=700 colspan=2 align=center:)%0a%0a%0a! %25center%25%25color=#008080%25First Floor%0a%0a!!!!!Room Name: (N)The Waystation%0a%0a%25center%25The first floor of the Waystation is inviting and relaxed.  There is a large bar with many TV's showing different shows and sports.  There is a scattering of tables, chairs and couches in the front, but the corner has a area used for dancing or moshing.  There is a stage set up, that can be used for local bands, or karaoke nights. %0aAround to the back side of the L shaped building is a smaller bar, with more seating for folks who want to eat and be away from the chaos of the front.  There is a elevator that is closely guarded.  Only people approved and staff can gain access to it.  There are restrooms off to the back end of the building.  On the outside is a nice and relaxing patio, windows and a sound system pumps music from inside.

Typically one gives the name of whoever is their leader for their venue.  Or sometimes a code word.  However even after that code word, the person applying must grant the employee a single drop of their blood.  The employee typically looks at the drop, rolling it on their fingers and smelling it.  Before they wash their hand clean and free.  Only then is the member allowed to sign the guest book. (%25red%25Note this is a custom tell, it only allows the employee to know that they are in one of the venues, not any details about them.  They only get Mortal +, Changeling, Beast, Vampire or Werewolf.  No details like Ghoul or Vampire, Changeling or Fae touched, Beast or Herald.%25%25) %0a%0aOnce upstairs via a nice elevator, they are greeted with deep reds and blacks decorating the area.  There is a dance floor in front of the jukebox, it is connected to the WiFi and allows people to pick any songs.  There are comfortable booths done in red leather all around, some couches, tables and chairs.  The key point is the large bar that folks can sit all around.  Everyone in this area is supernatural and mortal +.  So its safe to speak freely and relax because they don't have to pretend.%0a%0aThe kitchen for the whole area is on the second floor as well, and only accessible by an elevator, the kitchen cannot get to the Member's club directly.  There is only a pass through to accept food that's ordered.  %0a%0a!! %25center%25%25color=#008080%25Gallery%0a%0a|| %25newwin thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/Sg6xumy.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/Sg6xumy.jpg"Dance floor Area"]] || %25newwin thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/QKmvg3W.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/QKmvg3W.jpg"Seating"]] || %25newwin thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/FUmrjVj.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/FUmrjVj.jpg"Bar"]] || %25newwin thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/kFNpndv.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/kFNpndv.jpg"Booth Seating"]] ||%0a|| %25newwin thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/AtME2YU.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/AtME2YU.jpg"Jukebox"]] || %25newwin thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/P8lc85F.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/P8lc85F.jpg"Bar"]] || %25newwin thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/2zeSTNs.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/2zeSTNs.jpg"Bar"]] || %25newwin thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/757TybU.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/757TybU.jpg"Seating"]] ||%0a%0a!!! %25center%25%25color=#008080%25Rules For the Member's Club%25%25%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0aThese rules are carefully explained to anyone who signs the guest book and gains access to the 2nd floor.

He also knew he had to have a cover.  So he opened up the bar.  It has always been a local place.  From the start it was just one story, what is now the back bar, was originally the members only club.  As the bar grew, they expanded upwards.  With the help of his packmate, retired accountant Col. Robert H. Montgomery, they made the patio a comfortable place to enjoy the weather.  In the 50's the added on the 2nd & 3rd stories of the building.  Moving the Member's club to the second floor along with a better kitchen.   %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=25px margin-right=25px width=250px height=250px%25https://i.imgur.com/aI8oxNU.jpg%0a%3c As David grew older, and got involved in other works, he left the running of the bar to his families wolfblooded.  Picking those who had the tell to know someones ties,  he left them in charge.  While officially the bar has been passed through to different Fairchild blooded, the Family is always the one to pick who it goes too.  Whoever is listed, gets to have the 3rd floor apartment for themselves.  Over the years many blooded have added on to it until it's as you see it now.  The bar has now turned into a sort of hot spot for locals.  Sometimes tourist wander in but that is never the focus group for the bar's clientele.  In the 70's the stage was added, to help invite local bands to give shows.  Most local bands have at least one show there.   Now that [[Gwendolyn Bernhardt|Hart]] owns it, she has invested in a karaoke machine, along with updating the kitchen, stage and the decor.  She has also started having theme sort of nights.  %0a%3c %0a%3c \\%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25center%25%25color=#008080%25Schedule%0a%3c ||  ||  ||  ||! %25teal%25Month ||  ||  ||  ||%0a%3c ||! %25teal%25Monday ||! %25teal%25Tuesday ||! %25teal%25Wednesday ||! %25teal%25Thursday ||! %25teal%25Friday ||! %25teal%25Saturday ||! %25teal%25Sunday || %0a%3c || 5$ Margaritas || Open Mic Night || 1$ Jello Shots || Karaoke Night || Local Band || DJ Night || Speed Dating ||%0a---%0a> %25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=250px height=250px%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
