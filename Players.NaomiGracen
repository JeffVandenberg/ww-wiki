Sometimes she’ll even change the color ranging from simple streaks to full color changes. Her typical outfits tend to include anything latex or attention grabbing, and typically not in a good way. Though her attire changes occasionally to be more situational appropriate, though this is hardly typical. Mischievous blue eyes stare out at the world, almost baiting people in.
