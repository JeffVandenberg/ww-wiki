She’s good at convincing people to act contrary to their better angels. Maybe you need someone to give you the push. Or maybe you’re looking to save someone from such behavior.%0a*For the Blood Gods (Crone/ Vampire): For what little has been seen of her over the past several years, it’s no secret that this creature is a member of the Crone. She tends to espouse beliefs entirely contrary to the Lancea Sanctum, so far as to even own a BDSM club built out of the husk of a defunct church.%0a*Confession is good for the soul (Any): Got something you want to get off your chest?

Description%0a%3c %0a%3c Shoulder length blonde hair typically flows around her face, though occasionally her hair grows to halfway down her back if she chooses to leave it at its natural length for that night. Sometimes she’ll even change the color ranging from simple streaks to full color changes. Her typical outfits tend to include anything latex or attention grabbing, and typically not in a good way. Though her attire changes occasionally to be more situational appropriate, though this is hardly typical. Mischievous blue eyes stare out at the world, almost baiting people in. Somehow managing to look both predatory and vulnerable at once.%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!

Hooks%0a%3c %0a%3c *Yes, Mistress! (Any): Naomi is a mistress/ dominatrix. Whips, chains, and all. Maybe you were her pet one evening, or are looking to be.%0a%3c *Fuck morality (Any): Ever want to be free to do what you want, with who you want, when you want? Naomi can help you there. She’s good at convincing people to act contrary to their better angels. Maybe you need someone to give you the push. Or maybe you’re looking to save someone from such behavior.%0a%3c *For the Blood Gods (Crone/ Vampire): For what little has been seen of her over the past several years, it’s no secret that this creature is a member of the Crone. She tends to espouse beliefs entirely contrary to the Lancea Sanctum, so far as to even own a BDSM club built out of the husk of a defunct church.%0a%3c *Confession is good for the soul (Any): Got something you want to get off your chest? Some secret you can’t tell anyone else? Have a drink and tell her all about it. She’ll make you feel better about it.%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!
