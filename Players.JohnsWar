The shells hit and the world shattered. John felt the press of bodies on every side but his left, forced up tight against the cold mud of the fox hole. His arms were up, wrapped as best he could around his face, covering his ears. Screams and prayers mixed and echoed up from this waiting grave. %0a%0aAnd then silence. For a moment John knew that he must have died--a mortar had hit their dug out and killed them all. Nothing else struck his soul as an adequate explanation for the absolute chaos and the sudden peace. But a voice cried out: "Huns are coming! The wire's down and the Huns are coming! C'mon! Get up or we're all dead!"%0a%0aAnd so the soldiers surged from the hole, climbing out of the blackness of the earth into the twilight of the faded day. They scrambled, wet and muddied, to their positions. But as they ran more of the mortars came down, falling among their defenses, falling among the men, exploding into shrapnel and shredding flesh and breaking bone. %0a%0a[[John Murphy]] sprinted toward the guns. He cleared a wall just as a mortar hit behind him. He felt the impact--it knocked the wind from his lungs--but the wall saved him from the shrapnel. But Bill and Eddie had been behind him, and he knew they were done. %0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=5px lframe width=500px bgcolor=white border='5px solid black' padding=2px%25https://i.imgur.com/qGMAas5.jpg%0aDanny came around the other side and then collapsed, a leg giving out beneath him as he slid face-first into the mud. Small arms--John couldn't see them, but the Germans were crossing No Man's Land. Danny pushed himself up, shouting:"Murf! Get the gun!"%0a%0aAnd John pushed himself up the embankment, terror the lash at his back. He threw himself in against the gunner's nest and grabbed the handles of the machine gun. Someone else came up, but John couldn't tell who. "Feed me the bullets," John screamed against the chaos.%0a%0aThe world seemed to still once more as he focused down the sights of the machine gun. He could see figures charging in the dead light, and he fired a burst into them. John could discern nothing apart from the movement, and did not know who or how many.%0a%0a"I need flares! Get a Very and light it up!" No sooner than he had asked, he was answered, but not by flares. Star shells fell in No Man's Land, lighting up the rushing Huns. It seemed as bright as noon to John's darkened eyes, and he saw their line held, all their defenses were still in place--a few men dead, but now so many of his brother soldiers at the ready. What came next would not make John a hero--this would be a massacre.%0a%0aBack lit in the red light of the star shells, John sighted the Huns down the barrel of his gun. His blood chilled and his hands steadied. He fired again and again and again. He saw the men across the field ripped apart by his gun, blood spraying into the air like red blossoms blooming in a heartbeat. Dozens of men came apart before his very eyes.%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=15px margin-bottom=5px margin-left=5px lframe width=500px bgcolor=white border='5px solid black' padding=2px%25https://i.imgur.com/eg1fhdk.jpg%0aThe need to reload was the only thing that saved the rest. In the confusion and the chaos, the gun team was missing members, and they couldn't keep the gun fed. The Huns routed, turned, and ran back from whence they came, nothing to show for their assault but hundreds dead.%0a%0aAs sanity settled in again, John realized it was Stevens in the nest with him. "What the hell was that, Murf?" %0a%0aJohn shook his head. "I dunno. How long ha' we been sittin' here, starvin' in the cold and the mud? It ain't any better in their trenches. Maybe they just lost their minds 'fore we did?"%0a%0aStevens groaned as he pulled his coat tighter around his shoulders. "I half envy 'em. Them on the ground over--they're done with this. They ain't gotta wait any more like the rest of us."

The shells hit and the world shattered. John felt the press of bodies on every side but his left, forced up tight against the cold mud of the fox hole. His arms were up, wrapped as best he could around his face, covering his ears. Screams and prayers mixed and echoed up from this waiting grave. %0a> %0a> And then silence. For a moment John knew that he must have died--a mortar had hit their dug out and killed them all. Nothing else struck his soul as an adequate explanation for the absolute chaos and the sudden peace. But a voice cried out: "Huns are coming! The wire's down and the Huns are coming! C'mon! Get up or we're all dead!"%0a> %0a> And so the soldiers surged from the hole, climbing out of the blackness of the earth into the twilight of the faded day. They scrambled, wet and muddied, to their positions. But as they ran more of the mortars came down, falling among their defenses, falling among the men, exploding into shrapnel and shredding flesh and breaking bone. %0a> %0a> John Murphy sprinted toward the guns. He cleared a wall just as a mortar hit behind him. He felt the impact--it knocked the wind from his lungs--but the wall saved him from the shrapnel. But Bill and Eddie had been behind him, and he knew they were done. %0a> %0a> Danny came around the other side and then collapsed, a leg giving out beneath him as he slid face-first into the mud. Small arms--John couldn't see them, but the Germans were crossing No Man's Land. Danny pushed himself up, shouting:"Murf! Get the gun!"%0a> %0a> And John pushed himself up the embankment, terror the lash at his back. He threw himself in against the gunner's nest and grabbed the handles of the machine gun. Someone else came up, but John couldn't tell who. "Feed me the bullets," John screamed against the chaos.%0a> %0a> The world seemed to still once more as he focused down the sights of the machine gun. He could see figures charging in the dead light, and he fired a burst into them. John could discern nothing apart from the movement, and did not know who or how many.%0a> %0a> "I need flares! Get a Very and light it up!" No sooner than he had asked, he was answered, but not by flares. Star shells fell in No Man's Land, lighting up the rushing Huns. It seemed as bright as noon to John's darkened eyes, and he saw their line held, all their defenses were still in place--a few men dead, but now so many of his brother soldiers at the ready.%0a> %0a> The German commanders had not executed a brilliant attack that threatened to crush the American line--it desperation. What came next would not make John a hero--this would be a massacre.%0a> %0a> Back lit in the red light of the star shells, John sighted the Huns down the barrel of his gun. His blood chilled and his hands steadied. He fired again and again and again. He saw the men across the field ripped apart by his gun, blood spraying into the air like red blossoms blooming in an instance. Dozens of men came apart before his very eyes.%0a> %0a> The need to reload was the only thing that saved the rest. In the confusion and the chaos, the gun team was missing members, and they couldn't keep the gun fed. The Huns routed, turned, and ran back from whence they came, nothing to show for their assault by hundreds dead.%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
