A soul with no chains binding him to the Fallen Earth. His hair is a curly mess. His visage a clear reflection of his mocking Soul. Dressed in the skin of the skater, jeans hug his legs and wheels dress his boots. LEDs run the seams of his favorite hoodie with its too many seams and zippers. While hands slide too easily into pockets, Technology is NiK’s domain and he wears its regalia proudly when he wears anything at all. A hand runs through his hair in consideration. His balance shifts from one side to the next on feet set in line with his shoulders as he never fully settles into a single moment, always waiting for the next.%0a%0a%25mage%25Alan Deckard is a Face. A head of slick dark hair sharply defines his straight forward attitude while he looks out on a world to which he mostly belongs. Calm and patient, his eyes are gentle and his smile easy. Dressed to impress, he dons high fashion in its many shades. It would be a simple gesture for him to click his heels as his feet settle next to each other or cross. A hand brushes his chin in consideration. His is Tomorrow and a firm handshake will bring everyone along for the ride.%0a%0a%25mage%25The pair have the same even teeth and the same ghost of a beard. They move with a grace born of a lifetime in motion and wear the same face cast in different lights.%0a%0a%0a!%25mage%25 A Soul Manifest:%0a%0a'''%25mage%25The Long-Term: Supernal Warping and the Influence of Symbols'''\\%0a%25mage%25Power flows from the Source of All Things and the singular Oneness of the Prime. The Fallen will not contain such a force and so it ever bleeds through incomplete flesh and imperfect soul. A symbol acts as its conduit and so calls to other symbols through their relations.%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=6px margin-right=2px margin-bottom=2px  width=310 newwin%25 http://img00.deviantart.net/dc4f/i/2017/014/c/5/quantum_connections_by_crownos-daqu3j2.jpg%0a%25mage%25Energy flows through these relations performing its duties as dictated by form and function no fallen craft withstands. Sleeping devices wake to fulfill purpose unguided but by what code man has learned to bestow. A woken device finds itself burning brighter until it burns brightest before it, like Icarus, burns.%0a%0a'''%25mage%25The Immediate: Supernal Aura and the Influence of Truth'''\\%0a%25mage%25If a Fallen World will not sustain an idle conduit to the Aether, what hope has it to dam the opening of a floodgate which rouses the foundation of reality and the Truths which there lay buried. A cascade of conduits are blasted open with the assertion of Supernal Will and enforcement of Singularity upon symbols. Burning azure circuitry race through all the fabrics of the world to network the fractured Truths and force understanding as the Supernal Code is made manifest through its practice while all lesser code is made obviously simplistic. %0a%0a'''%25mage%25The Signature: Supernal Echoes and the Influence of Will'''\\%0a%25mage%25Scars mark the Fallen World when its foundation is disrupted. The Cave has forgotten what it was to know the Sun and its dampness has been dried under that harsh radiance. Circuitry remains embedded and its edges trail faintly as if upon a breeze, grasping to complete a circuit with that unfathomable, momentary force. Faint light yet remains but it is as much a shell as the world in which it remains. %0a%0a'''%25mage%25The Tilt: The Road Ahead'''\\%0a%25mage%25There’s a road forward as the circuits lay the course of potential innovation. They trace a path that can be followed or diverged from to walk a different course. They always arc forward, etching themselves, affirming Truths in the Eye of the Source of All Things. Follow them. Your steps are clear and your purpose absolutely, unflinching and unbreakable. %0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a!%25mage%25 Those People Closest:%0a%0a(:table:)%0a(:cellnr width=50%25 align=left style='padding-right: 10px;':)%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px width=175%25[[https://i.imgur.com/hsdHxZR.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/BHVdGe7.jpg]]%0a%25mage%25'''[[LaylaLabyrinthBoyd|Labyrinth]]'''\\%0a%25mage%25Predator.

Dressed in the skin of the skater, jeans hug his legs and wheels dress his boots. LEDs run the seams of his favorite hoodie with its too many seams and zippers. While hands slide too easily into pockets, Technology is NiK’s domain and he wears its regalia proudly when he wears anything at all. A hand runs through his hair in consideration. His balance shifts from one side to the next on feet set in line with his shoulders as he never fully settles into a single moment, always waiting for the next.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25mage%25Alan Deckard is a Face. A head of slick dark hair sharply defines his straight forward attitude while he looks out on a world to which he mostly belongs. Calm and patient, his eyes are gentle and his smile easy. Dressed to impress, he dons high fashion in its many shades. It would be a simple gesture for him to click his heels as his feet settle next to each other or cross. A hand brushes his chin in consideration. His is Tomorrow and a firm handshake will bring everyone along for the ride.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25mage%25The pair have the same even teeth and the same ghost of a beard. They move with a grace born of a lifetime in motion and wear the same face cast in different lights.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !%25mage%25 A Soul Manifest:%0a%3c %0a%3c '''%25mage%25The Long-Term: Supernal Warping and the Influence of Symbols'''\\%0a%3c %25mage%25Power flows from the Source of All Things and the singular Oneness of the Prime. The Fallen will not contain such a force and so it ever bleeds through incomplete flesh and imperfect soul. A symbol acts as its conduit and so calls to other symbols through their relations.%0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=6px margin-right=2px margin-bottom=2px  width=310 newwin%25 http://img00.deviantart.net/dc4f/i/2017/014/c/5/quantum_connections_by_crownos-daqu3j2.jpg%0a%3c %25mage%25Energy flows through these relations performing its duties as dictated by form and function no fallen craft withstands. Sleeping devices wake to fulfill purpose unguided but by what code man has learned to bestow. A woken device finds itself burning brighter until it burns brightest before it, like Icarus, burns.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''%25mage%25The Immediate: Supernal Aura and the Influence of Truth'''\\%0a%3c %25mage%25If a Fallen World will not sustain an idle conduit to the Aether, what hope has it to dam the opening of a floodgate which rouses the foundation of reality and the Truths which there lay buried. A cascade of conduits are blasted open with the assertion of Supernal Will and enforcement of Singularity upon symbols. Burning azure circuitry race through all the fabrics of the world to network the fractured Truths and force understanding as the Supernal Code is made manifest through its practice while all lesser code is made obviously simplistic. %0a%3c %0a%3c '''%25mage%25The Signature: Supernal Echoes and the Influence of Will'''\\%0a%3c %25mage%25Scars mark the Fallen World when its foundation is disrupted. The Cave has forgotten what it was to know the Sun and its dampness has been dried under that harsh radiance. Circuitry remains embedded and its edges trail faintly as if upon a breeze, grasping to complete a circuit with that unfathomable, momentary force. Faint light yet remains but it is as much a shell as the world in which it remains. %0a%3c %0a%3c '''%25mage%25The Tilt: The Road Ahead'''\\%0a%3c %25mage%25There’s a road forward as the circuits lay the course of potential innovation. They trace a path that can be followed or diverged from to walk a different course. They always arc forward, etching themselves, affirming Truths in the Eye of the Source of All Things. Follow them. Your steps are clear and your purpose absolutely, unflinching and unbreakable. %0a---%0a> !%25mage%25 Appearance:%0a> %0a> %0a> %25mage%25 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
