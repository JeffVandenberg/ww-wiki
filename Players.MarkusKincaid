He's athletic and lean, but little to not muscles on his body. He's too thin and just about average height with short hair that's just long enough to give him a wild look. His clothes are usually blue jeans of expensive design, black boots, and a various assortment of shirts that depict various pop culture icons and mostly punk rock bands. He also almost always has decorations of some kind of nerd life, from Ravenclaw scarfs to necklaces with symbols and the One Ring to Rule them All. Often he has a laptop holder at his side with a number of good books of Occult nature. His wrists are adorned in protective and occult charms that are authentic to those that know of various occult histories.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25%0a%3c %0a---%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/wLxi6iE.png%0a> %0a> !!!!%25center%25%25vampire%25''With Blush''%0a> %25center%25 Soft features, handsome in his own way. His hair is long, eyes a dark brown, and he always seems to have something on his mind. He's thin. Perhaps a bit too thin, but just shy of unhealthy looking. His clothes are comfortable and efficient, though they lack any kind of style or fashion. %0a> %0a> Despite the lack of fashionable clothes, you can always find jewelry on him. These pieces of Jewelry range from rings, necklaces, earrings, to bracers and the like are often etched with runes or charms of some kind of occult meaning. Nothing ever too expensive, but there all the same.%0a> !!!!%25center%25%25vampire%25''Bloodless''%0a> %25center%25 Those too-thin features now become more pronounced. He looks unhealthy and gaunt, his bones protruding from his ribs and shoulders and quite noticeable. His face is sunken, his eyes dark and cold, and his skin becomes a pale color of ivory.%0a> %0a> !!!!%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/pJsIg2O.png%0a> %0a> %25center%25Markus arrived in the city around mid 2019 from seemingly out of nowhere and already an established member of the Ordo Dracul. He's seemingly a devil's advocate in most aspects, always happy to challenge the status quo. If engaged, one might get the impression that he feels becoming comfortable or static prevents growth, and creates a city of stagnation.%0a> %0a> %25center%25He can often be seen with his Coterie-mate %25vampire%25[[Dex Secundinus|Dex]] %25white%25 and the two seem to have an old and powerful relationship. Markus can often be found around haunted houses, Occult Workshops, old Libraries, and abandoned places that seem to have an air of mystery. %0a> %0a> %0a42,61c63,71%0a%3c !!%25center%25%25beast%25'''Contacts'''%0a%3c %0a%3c (:table table border=0 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0:)%0a%3c (:cellnr width=45%25 align=center:)%25vampire%25'''Coterie Mates:''' %0a%3c (:cellnr width=45%25 align=left  style='background-color:black;' :)%0a%3c *%25vampire%25[[Michael Youssef|Michael]] %25white%25- The Face.%0a%3c *%25vampire%25[[Dex Secundinus|Dex]] %25white%25- The Muscle.%0a%3c *%25vampire%25[[Alexia Tristitia |Alexia]] %25white%25 - Control.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (:tableend:)%0a%3c (:table table border=0 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0:)%0a%3c (:cellnr width=45%25 align=center:)%25vampire%25'''Social Calls:'''%0a%3c (:cellnr width=45%25 align=left  style='background-color:black;' :) %0a%3c *%25beast%25[[RoselynnVogel|Rose]]%25white%25 - She's the Law!%0a%3c *%25vampire%25[[Charlotte Locke|Lottie]]%25white%25 - Very much my one shiny.%0a%3c *%25vampire%25[[Gracie Hamel|Gracie]]%25white%25 - The friendly temptation.%0a%3c *%25vampire%25[[Valentina Petrova|Valentina]]%25white%25 - The close friend.%0a%3c (:tableend:)%0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/wNdD2lc.png%0a> %0a> ||! %25vampire%25Image ||! %25vampire%25Name ||! %25vampire%25Relationship ||! %25vampire%25Comment ||! %25vampire%25Ringtone ||%0a> || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/lJEWvSv.jpg || %25vampire%25[[ Charlotte Locke|Lottie (Little Bird)]] || %25vampire%25 My Shiny || %25vampire%25 She's changed my life in ways I could have never expected.
