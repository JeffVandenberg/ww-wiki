His hair is long, eyes a dark brown, and he always seems to have something on his mind. He's thin. Perhaps a bit too thin, but just shy of unhealthy looking. His clothes are comfortable and efficient, though they lack any kind of style or fashion. %0a%0aDespite the lack of fashionable clothes, you can always find jewelry on him. These pieces of Jewelry range from rings, necklaces, earrings, to bracers and the like are often etched with runes or charms of some kind of occult meaning. Nothing ever too expensive, but there all the same.%0a!!!!%25center%25%25vampire%25''Bloodless''%0a%25center%25 Those too-thin features now become more pronounced. He looks unhealthy and gaunt, his bones protruding from his ribs and shoulders and quite noticeable. His face is sunken, his eyes dark and cold, and his skin becomes a pale color of ivory.%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/pJsIg2O.png%0a%0a%25center%25Markus arrived in the city around mid 2019 from seemingly out of nowhere and already an established member of the Ordo Dracul. He's seemingly a devil's advocate in most aspects, always happy to challenge the status quo. If engaged, one might get the impression that he feels becoming comfortable or static prevents growth, and creates a city of stagnation.%0a%0a%25center%25He can often be seen with his Coterie-mate %25vampire%25[[Dex Secundinus|Dex]] %25white%25 and the two seem to have an old and powerful relationship. Markus can often be found around haunted houses, Occult Workshops, old Libraries, and abandoned places that seem to have an air of mystery. %0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/wNdD2lc.png%0a%0a||! %25vampire%25Image ||! %25vampire%25Name ||! %25vampire%25Relationship ||! %25vampire%25Comment ||! %25vampire%25Ringtone ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/lJEWvSv.jpg || %25mortal%25[[ Charlotte Locke|Lottie (Little Bird)]] || %25mortal%25 My Shiny || %25mortal%25 She's changed my life in ways I could have never expected.
