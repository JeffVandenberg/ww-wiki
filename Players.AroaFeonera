In a relaxed setting, where tensions are low, she can be found in deep red and black dresses, well-tailored, but lacking an ostentatious appearance. She might normally blend into the background of a club or party. When the night calls for professionalism, she favors a long yet surprisingly light trench coat of a deep blue that appears almost black under all but the most evident lighting. Within the jacket, are simple yet form fitting driving gloves, tops and slacks in similarly cool dark tones. Her appearance is never unkempt or disheveled, but it seems to fade into the background.
