He moves with an odd level of grace, though, very purposeful in everything he does. Typically he wears long sleeved dark shirts and somewhat tight matching jeans, often beneath a large flowing black jacket that seems to accentuate his unsettling aura. Despite seeming at a glance like the sort of person who might fade into the background, he seems quite capable of stepping into the forefront as well, when needed.%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25beast%25'''The Horror'''%0a%0aThe Namtaru's horror, "The Forgotten," is a collection of ectoplasm and ephemera formed from the castoff remnants of countless ghosts formed by careless or immoral people. It's colored a deep gray, just a hair from black, looking vaguely humanoid, shadowy eyes peering out from a "hood" formed of the same substance of the rest of it. Its form occasionally warps and changes, looking like it is or isn't wearing a full "robe" or having its eyes become more or less visible, its height change, or otherwise just reshaping as the liquid ectoplasm that makes it up shifts around.%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25beast%25'''The Lair'''%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=10px border='2px solid #6e68a3' width=305 margin-right=10px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=0px newwin%25https://i.imgur.com/ALKCbPU.png%0a%0aThe Heart of The Forgotten's Lair takes the form of the foyer of a haunted, victorian-style manor, broken down and decrepit, with signs of age along the floors, walls, stairway leading upward, and every door that seems to lead out of the area. The first floor has one boarded up doorway leading further in, and another that's hanging loosely off its hinges and more visibly leads inward. On the second floor, a few opened doors lead into bedrooms, broken down (but usable) bathrooms, and other basic amenities, although here at least, they're all fairly small. \\%0aCountless ghostly spectres can constantly be seen patrolling the area, grasping hands reaching to take hold of intruders as dim lighting tries and fails to trickle in through the windows, casting no more than an eerie glow to the place. %0a%0aThe first chamber branches off of the foyer's open first floor doorway down a long, dark hallway with more boarded up archways along each side. End tables, old paintings, and other ruined decorations line the walls. It leads into an old, decrepit looking, but expansive and large dining area, rotted food lining the extended table that reaches across the lengthy room, countless specters stopping to 'eat and drink' as they patrol the Lair. Where the ghosts ''don't'' sit, however, the food seems slightly more palatable, and in fact does indeed sate the hunger of living visitors (with the Beast's permission). Like the foyer, the only illumination is what little starlight can creep through the windows and broken boards along the walls.%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=10px border='2px solid #6e68a3' width=305 margin-right=0px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=10px newwin%25https://i.imgur.com/s2y6w63.png%0aOn the opposite side of the dining room, another dark hallway leads into the master bedroom. Slightly less decrepit than the rest of the house, it nonetheless holds dust, cobwebs, and other signs of aging. The bottom area has ruffled furniture and an old grandfather clock in it, ticking away a little more slowly than it should be. A spiral stairway then leads upward to the loft, where the bed itself, an old wardrobe, and bookcases that are currently empty can be found, little spiders crawling across the shelves. On the opposite end of the room, a large, cracked mirror is propped next to the wall, where ghostly faces occasionally stare outward.%0a%0aBeneath a hidden hatch in the lofted bedroom, down in the corner and covered by an old rug, is a hidden underground passageway that slowly transforms from cellar-like crafted stone with wooden braces into a sculpted natural cavern. Ectoplasm, rather than water, drips from stalactites on the ceiling and pools eerily near the walls. It opens then, into a large cavern with a stream of blood flowing through it, a little broken down rowboat tied to a stalagmite and seeming to be endlessly battered by the running waters, yet still capable of floating. Collapsed tunnels seem like they could lead outward, but the rocks are too large and too dug into place to be moved. The bare illumination in here comes from some eerily glowing crystals in the walls. If one did brave the small boat, the River itself leads down a tunnel that gets darker and darker, until finally it spills out into a [[Contessa Mercado|void]].%0a%0a%0a%25center%25%0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25beast%25'''Hooks'''%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=10px border='2px solid #6e68a3' width=305 margin-right=10px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=0px newwin%25https://i.imgur.com/0sg5VyC.jpg%0a%0a!!!!%25beast%25 ''Eye for Ghosts (Anyone ghost-oriented)'':%0aJoseph is capable of seeing ghosts, likely not surprising to anyone who knows the nature of his own Horror, and has a tendency to seek out haunted locations (to learn about ''why'' they're haunted). \\%0aIn particular, he's also made a habit, as of late, of delving more and more into the Underworld itself, both to align his Horror to it and to learn more about the nature of ghosts and their cosmological place (or lack thereof).%0a%0a!!!!%25beast%25 ''The Forgotten Threads (Cult, Ghost/Fate-oriented Characters)'':%0aJoseph's Horror has begun to build a Legend around itself as an unseen predator that passes judgment down upon those that disrupt the weave of destiny by creating ghosts and similar creatures through selfishness or violence.
