A relatively small venue with notoriously strict doormen serving as gatekeepers.  A relatively small venue, hundreds of would be patrons line up each night just for the privilege of being turned away at the velvet rope.  It’s become a badge of honor in some circles to brag about how many times you’ve been turned away.%0a%0aInside, the place is exactly what you’d expect from an exclusive Miami nightclub.  Wall to wall gorgeous people, all dressed in a way that looks both glamorous and somehow beach casual.  Pumping music that pulses through the crowd.  And an atmosphere thick with the scent of excess and vice.%0a%0aLayout:  The main venue is simply a large tent.  The whole place is cloaked in the feel and vibe of classic Hollywood’s version of Arabia.  Sheer silks, and other fine cloths, all dyed in vibrant shades of red and gold..  A scent of exotic spices always in the air.  Of course it has the pulsing lights and thumping music of any good nightclub.  Security roams the grounds dressed as Arabian swordsman, complete with real sharpened scimitars.  Gorgeous belly dancers writhe on the dance floor.%0a%0aSurrounding the main tent are a series of smaller, private tents.  A place for more “intimate” gatherings.  And then there is an exit, marked by a velvet rope and “Members Only” sign that leads towards the beach.  And exclusive inner sanctum within this exclusive sanctum of the rich and beautiful.  %0a%0aThe Members section is reserved for the city’s Kindred and their guests.  It is a private little beach, on a small cove.  Soothing light music plays here, away from the loud, ear splitting thump of the club.  The lights are red hued lanterns, strung up around the gather area.  Various seats and lounges are available%0a%0aSupernatural:  The Arabian’s Members Only section serves as a not-quite Elysium to the city, allowing the owner to implement her own policies on who can and cannot come.  All Invictus members are welcomed of course, as are most of the city’s Kindred citizens.  All you have to do is receive a Member’s Card from an existing member.  They are easy to obtain, but management reserves the right to suspend or revoke one’s membership at any time and for any reason.  And all guests, including members, are expected to dress in a manner fitting to such an exclusive venue.  %0a%0a%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=25px margin-right=25px width=250px height=250px%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png%0aOther supernaturals are allowed, but only if invited and escorted by a Member.
