They started off hopeful. Some of the details get twisted, but they always begin with a boy that found his way into the Hedge on a mission to save a swan from Arcadia. His girlfriend, his friend, his true love? Those parts are different, but it ends the same way: she's taken from him, but he doesn't give up. He carries a shield bearing two swans and goes back again, confident that he'll save her. But he's sent away, bleeding and broken. He can't give up on this story and his role in it. He's the Swan Knight, he's destined to save her, he promised. Over the decades he becomes a legend, appearing every few years within some city before finding his way into the Hedge once more, always seeking to fulfill his promise, until the last time when he was left bleeding out, the Thorns drinking deep, and though he heard the Swan's cries he hung his head in shame and fell. %0a%0a!!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''Hedge Guide (Changelings)'': %0aAdam's spent an extended amount of time in the Hedge and seems to have an intimate knowledge of how the realm works.

He doesn't talk in group much, offering the bare minimum to be included, but does sometimes pursue one-on-one conversations with those grieving. %0a%0a!!%25center%25https://imgur.com/y3DAhdM.gif%0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a(:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a%0a(:cellnr width=100%25:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''Quotes'''%0a%0a%25mortal%25 "I am a quote!

Except for his eyes. Where they could have been a warm brown at one point, now they're cold, tired, calculated. As for clothes, it's almost always t-shirts and jeans, and there aren't many that don't have rips, tears, or stains on them. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c (:div2end:)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''Contacts'''%0a%3c %0a%3c ||! %25changeling%25Image ||! %25changeling%25Name ||! %25changeling%25Relationship ||! %25changeling%25Comment ||! %25changeling%25Ringtone ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c %0a%3c (:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''Hooks'''%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''The Swan Knight (Fame 1: Changelings)'': %0a%3c You might have heard the stories. They started off hopeful. Some of the details get twisted, but they always begin with a boy that found his way into the Hedge and went to save a swan from Arcadia. His girlfriend, his friend, his true love? Those parts are different, but it ends the same way: she's taken from him, but he doesn't give up. He carries a shield bearing two swans and goes back again, confident that he'll save her. But he's sent away, bleeding and broken. He can't give up on this story and his role in it. He's the Swan Knight, he's destined to save her, he promised. Over the decades he becomes a legend, appearing every few years within some city before finding his way into the Hedge once more, always seeking to fulfill his promise, until the last time when he was left bleeding out, the Thorns drinking deep, and though he heard the Swan's cries he hung his head in shame and fell. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''Hedge Guide (Changelings)'': %0a%3c Adam's spent an extended amount of time in the Hedge and seems to have an intimate knowledge of how the realm works. He's almost always willing to go back, obsessively so, and is willing to hire himself out as an aid in navigation or a bodyguard.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''Dealing with Loss (Anyone)'': %0a%3c Adam frequents group therapy sessions sponsored by churches and other local groups that help others deal with loss in their lives: spouses, children, friends, etc. He's often found stocking up on any offered food along with paying close attention when the actual sessions start. He doesn't talk much in group much, offering the bare minimum to be included, but does sometimes pursue one-on-one conversations with those grieving. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c (:div2end:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:cellnr width=100%25:)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''Quotes'''%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
