It is, quite frankly, beautiful beyond what a human can imagine. This beauty hides dangers, however, and those that traverse it must be wary of the thorns that lie in waiting.%0a%0aThe topography of the Hedge in Miami is varied but one theme carries throughout: water.  Whether as treacherous swamps teeming with creatures unseen beyond the thorns, broken buildings choked by strange plant life or flat expanses of sawgrass that will not hesitate to drink you dry the moment you step off the path, streams, puddles and full-on rivers and lakes in some cases can be found just about everywhere.  The hobs that dwell within are often aquatic in nature as well, either living under the water or in structures rendered stable enough to support them near the edges.%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''The Crossroads''%0aThis rather unique crossroads in the Hedge around Miami is believed to have been present in some fashion for centuries, but took up its current form in the late 1920s after the work of Henry Flagler brought the rail lines south and inspired new dreams among the newly-arriving populace.  The Silver Lining Freehold does their part to help maintain the trods that run through the hub along with the hub itself, although the local hobs handle the upkeep in their own way.%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #006400' margin-top=0px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=25px width=250px height=350px%25https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/3/30/FFXIV_Phantom_Train_concept.jpg%0aThe Hub takes the form of an old-school train station platform with a massive hedge-steel train taking center stage, steam often wafting from the engine’s chimney and between ten and fifteen cars trailing behind it.  A few hob run stalls are dotted around the platform, selling the usual trappings one finds at a train station seen through the Wyrd’s lens - the newspapers in particular can be rather interesting - but the star of the show is naturally the train itself.%0a%0aThe train is accessed through an entrance behind the engine, with doorways between the cars allowing for passage between them.  Each trod that connects through the crossroads passes through one car, with the gateways from the trod into the hub varying in form; one that involves passing through a brick wall, for example, has been dubbed the “9 ¾ entrance” by some Lost that are more up to date on modern culture.  Once travelers have entered the car they are free to remain on that trod and continue on through the gate on the other side of the car, or they can step off and head out onto the platform proper or change ‘lanes’ and enter another trod through a different car.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Siren's Swamp''%0aThe swamps of Miami's Hedge are largely unknown due to the incalculably large wall blockading it from the rest of the hedge the freehold commonly traverses. Even Summer's patrols only take them up to the hob checkpoint at the border before returning. The wall itself has been in place for decades. Rumor has it that the wall was erected by the freehold decades past to ward off a known entrance to Arcadia leading to the Siren of the Deep's domain. Another rumor refutes this and states the Siren of the Deep is nothing more than a powerful hobgoblin that has claimed the entirety of the swamp as its domain. Yet another states that the Siren of the Deep is nothing more than a manifestation of the overwhelming thorns that have taken over the swamp in its entirety. %0a%0aTo the Silver Lining, this area of the Hedge has been written off in its entirety. Only one small tribe of Hobs is known to walk in and out of that path bringing goods meant for The Crossroads. These handful of dreary creatures never speak of the swamps, nor do they have the mouths or voices to do so if they wished. The Freehold doesn't prohibit Changelings from entering, but the tribe of hobs do. Entering is also considered foolhardy and not something brag-worthy. Many have been lured off the poorly tended trod leading past the wall by the Siren's Song into the Thorns of Swarms.%0a%0a(Scenes to the swamp must be run by a narrator)%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a%0a----%0a %0a!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''The Freehold''%25%25%0a%0a!!!''The Ivy Library''%0a'''Gate Location''': [[City/South#toc2|Coconut Grove]] \\%0a'''Owned By''': Spring Court%0a%0a'''Spheres and Factions''' %0a* Changeling%0a%0a'''Hooks''' %0a* Getting Up To Date%0a%0aContrary to what most would expect, one of the most prominent Hollows held by the Spring Court houses a grand library tucked into the Hedge surrounding the more mundane library building in Coconut Grove. Created by Mallory Haversham, a Wizened who served as Spring Queen in the early 70s and found her greatest passion in the pursuit of knowledge, the collection has been built upon and maintained by the court’s members ever since. While not as in-depth as the Autumn Court’s holdings on certain matters, the library is open to all members of the freehold and covers a variety of topics both mundane and mystical.%0a%0aThe double-door entrance into the hollow proper opens into the main part of the structure, filled with rows of bookshelves for visitors to peruse and a reading area nearby hosting a number of round wooden tables and comfortable chairs.  A number of rooms line the back wall, each with its own purpose: one holds the official office for the Archivist, others are private reading rooms, and one of the more recent additions holds a nascent computer lab.  This room houses four computers brought in from the Ironside, connected to each other and the collection of scanned texts made available for research but not yet able to reach outside of the hollow.  Visitors are warned to make sure that the monitors are covered once not in use per the Archivist's orders, however; technology often gets testy in the Hedge, as most Lost eventually learn, and this step seems to keep the machines calm for the most part.%0a%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!!''The Emerald Throne''%0a'''Gate Location''': [[City/South#toc2|Coconut Grove]] \\%0a'''Owned By''': Spring Court%0a%0a'''Spheres and Factions''' %0a* Changeling%0a%0a'''Hooks''' %0a* Where All The Fun Happens%0a%0aThe main seat of power for the Spring Court is in Coconut Grove, with their largest holding located in the Hedge surrounding the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens. While not a brick-for-brick reconstruction of the estate the footprint of the hollow is a close match as far as size, with the buildings themselves pulling from a similar Mediterranean inspiration. It is here that the grand ballrooms, meeting halls and immaculately tended gardens of the Verdant can be found, along with living quarters for guests of the Court or newly arrived Lost who are in need of shelter in such trying times. %0a%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!!''[[Changeling/SummerCourt#toc7|The Hall of Victors]]''%0a'''Gate Location''': [[https://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/City/Central#toc2|Brickell]] \\%0a'''Owned By''': Summer Court%0a%0a'''Spheres and Factions''' %0a* Changeling%0a%0a'''Hooks''' %0a* A Place To Remember%0a%0aAlso known as the Hall of Victors, the entryway to the Hollow is decorated with emblems and objects of fallen comrades. A memorial of sorts, but not one for sorrowful moments of silence. This hall is always loud and, in a very Norse fashion, is filled with tables for feasts and comradery to tell stories of victory, with particular emphasis on the deeds of the fallen. Towards the back is a raised table reserved for the war council, also acting as the Queen’s throne to hear official matters. If there isn’t an official need, the ruling motley often sits with their brothers and sisters in arms at the other tables of the Hall.%0a%0aIt is never more rowdy than in the summer with the fireplaces in the walls stoked to raging bonfires containing the Crimson Court’s wrath. In the, Winter a somber air falls about the place. The fires become candle wicks licking off embers and the memorial providing plenty of moments for silent reflection.Come Spring’s reign, the fires are stoked and the Hollow sees its encouraging atmosphere increase.%0a%0aWhile the feasting hall, training grounds and post-sparring recovery areas are open to sworn and potential freehold members, behind that the heavy locks and wards become harsher. Only those sworn to the Crimson Court are allowed beyond them to the armory, war room and vaults beyond. Helios’s gaze falls on any who try to slip beyond where they belong and many find the rain of fire not to be worth what could be gleaned from a successful intrusion. %0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!!''The Labyrinth''%0a'''Gate Location''': [[City/North#toc10|Liberty City]] \\%0a'''Owned By''': Autumn Court%0a%0a'''Spheres and Factions''' %0a* Changeling%0a%0a'''Hooks''' %0a* Twists and Turns%0a%0aThe central hollow for the Leaden Mirror is located underground in the Hedge, taking the form of a network of caves connected by twisting tunnels that take some getting used to to navigate; rumors abound that they actually move and only those of the Court know the patterns they follow, but such things are remain rumors for now. The main entrance to the network is a passage down through the firmament, the air within slowly thickening until it becomes nigh-impossible to take a breath. Crossing the threshold into the main chamber breaks the spell, albeit leaving the entrant with the lingering flicker of fear that suits the domain of the Autumn Court quite well indeed. Other entrances exist, of course, known by members of the Court and those who have garnered the appropriate amount of goodwill, and often connect to certain sections of the network: a grand library that houses the court’s gathered knowledge, chambers set aside for magical experimentation and quarters for courtiers or valued guests who do not have a place to stay on the Ironside. %0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!!''The Hollow of Hospitality''%0a'''Gate Location''': Changes Seasonally \\%0a'''Owned By''': Winter Court%0a%0a'''Spheres and Factions''' %0a* Changeling%0a%0a'''Hooks''' %0a* Only snow in Miami%0a%0aIn the off-seasons, this hollow carries with it a somber sorrow with it. Holiday seasons have passed and the time of gifts and family seems forever off even if only a mere month away. Fresh powder turns to trampled mush and snowmen are constantly melting with twisted expressions of grief. Willows weep from melting icicles and sing their sorrowful dirge on the wind causing the faint feeling of past joy that flees with the breeze. Grief rests heavy on everyone’s shoulders and no more so than in the Summer’s heat at Winter’s weakest. All the while the hedge ghosts lament and cling to those who enter for comfort. Typically Mother Hellen alone spends any amount of time here along with what caretakers help her with the hollow’s upkeep and all other Lost avoid it due to its unpleasant environment.%0a%0aThis is in stark contrast to the Winter months when Winter is strong. Sorrow isn’t expressed, but lifted from all who enter; leaving room in visitors’ hearts for more pleasant emotions. The hedge ghosts no longer grieve nor cling to the living for comfort, making them more approachable if any chose to interact with them. Large flakes gracefully fall from the sky onto fresh powder and refresh any who manage to catch one on their tongue. Footsteps quickly find themselves covered over to smooth out the indentations%0a%0aDuring the holiday seasons, there is a large tree in the entrance courtyard which is lavishly decorated and all are welcome to come to lift their spirits. Many of the Winter courtiers stay at the edge during this time and oversee the celebrations of their fellows, both seen and unseen. Enjoying seeing the joy others are able to express and remind themselves as the Silent Arrow that their harsh work is worth it in the end.%0a%0aBeyond the courtyard is the castle of ice, although it’s more like a giant ski lodge once within. Warm fires in small and large rooms alike for private or public gathering. Hot chocolate and marshmallows with hot tomato soup for the soul for those looking to tickle their nostalgia or more exotic hedge variants, such as spiced babbleroot with whipped mist that garbles nonsensically as you drink it all the way down your throat to your stomach; causing one’s stomach to ‘talk’ for the next hour. No secrets are kept here so those that come are allowed to wander as they desire.%0a%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!!''The Hollow of Silence''%0a'''Gate Location''': A hum and a knock away \\%0a'''Owned By''': Winter Court%0a%0a'''Spheres and Factions''' %0a* Changeling%0a%0a'''Hooks''' %0a* Where Secrets are Exchanged%0a%0aMuch like the Hollow of Hospitality, during the off Winter seasons the ghosts seek out the living. Only these are not the normal harmless hedge ghosts that occupy the kinder Hollow. Angel and Mare are not as kind as their counterpart and have made deals with wraiths to guard them when they are at their weakest. Those without a Winter mantle are attacked on sight and for that reason, among others, it breaks the oath to the Winter court to bring in another courtier. Only Mother Hellen is exempt from this clause and times can be counted on one hand how often that has been a necessity since the motley’s reign.%0a%0aUpon entering, there is no place to hide in shadow or cover. The pathway to the stronghold of Winter’s halls lay open and exposed to the wraiths who silently line the walls lying in wait for the foolish. A deathly silence permeates this Hollow and even a whisper carries on the cold wind to ears unknown and any loud noise gathers the attention of others.%0a%0aWhen Winter’s reign begins, most of the wraiths are allowed to rest and the environment itself turns against anyone with a harsh blizzard. For this reason, typically one of the first contracts Winter Courtiers learn after taking their oath tends to be “Heart of Ice” if they spend any amount of time here. The non-oathed find out that the lack of wraiths is not a weakness in Winter’s defense. If they manage to get past the harsh environment without getting lost in the blinding blizzard, much harsher wards await within.%0a%0aPast the entrance is the main hall with private rooms for whispered conversations in warded privacy. All are told upon being shown these rooms not to expect privacy from the Monarch as he is keenly aware of the secrets whispered in his Hollow.%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a----%0a %0a!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''The Markets''%25%25%0a%0a!!!''The Lyric Market''%0a'''Gate Location''': [[City/Central#toc9|Overtown]] \\%0a'''Owned By''': Mister House%0a%0a'''Spheres and Factions''' %0a* Changeling%0a%0a'''Hooks''' %0a* Under New Management!%0a* Caveat Emptor%0a%0aFor one's daily needs the permanent goblin market located in the Hedge around Overtown will often do the trick, although getting into and out of the gate tucked in between a grocery store and the Lyric Theater can be sporting depending on the time of day due to the roughness of the neighborhood.  This market is geared more towards hedge fruits and other oddities, taking the form of a large open space filled with booths and tents much like a more mundane farmer's markets and manned by hobs of all stripes.%0a%0aThere are some more permanent structures carved from the thorns - a tavern of sorts run by a no-nonsense porcine hob by the name of Mama Morton that won't hesitate to throw troublemakers into the next pot of stew to be sold, as well as a shop focused on the sales of odd tomes and maps run by one of the Lost who claim the role of merchant in the market.  Known simply as Uriel, the obsidian-carved Elemental is a connoisseur of the written word, able to track down hidden tomes for a price.  While he bears no mantle himself he carries the goodwill of the Autumn Court, as their members will use his services on a regular basis when their own efforts come up short.%0a%0aDuring the fall of 2019 the ragtag group of hobs that 'ran' the Market found themselves ran out on a rail - literally, in the case of one poor fellow - as an enigmatic figure who referred to itself as Mister House took over the reins.  Few have seen him face to face, working mostly through intermediaries, but his hold on the land is...well, iron-clad, as distasteful as the term is among fae-kind.  The vendors haven't complained about the change in management, with most continuing to do business as they always have.%0a%0a'''Market Laws''' %0a* None shall obstruct trade within the confines of the market%0a* No one shall commit wanton violence%0a* An order from Mister House is considered law%0a%0a'''Notable Merchants''' %0a* [[Players/AvaMarshall|Ava Marshall]], Lost smith and member of [[Players/Rara Avis]]%0a* Click and Clank, a pair of mechanical hobs known for oddments aplenty%0a* Mama Morton, hob and operator of the Hogswallow Tavern%0a* [[Players/NatalieQuinzel|Natalie Quinzel]], primary greeter of the market%0a* Old Mary, a hob known for (relatively) accurate information of the local Hedge%0a* [[Players/Uriel|Uriel]], bookseller and collector of many things%0a%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!!''The Mirror of Paradise''%0a'''Gate Location''': Near [[City/Southeast#toc7|Virginia Key]] \\%0a'''Owned By''': The Captain%0a%0a'''Spheres and Factions''' %0a* Changeling%0a%0a'''Hooks''' %0a* Beware the Black Dot%0a* Treasures From Beyond The Edge%0a%0aJust north of Virginia Key lie two small islands, covered in trees and normally occupied only by wildlife and the occasional groups of squatters or party-goers. On the night of the new moon, however, a hedge gate opens wide on the larger of the two islands, granting those who pass through it access to a marvel of hobgoblin engineering and one of the largest known mobile Goblin Markets: a vast array of ships of various sizes, connected by a network of ladders, wooden bridges and rope netting that can be called warren-like at best. Known as the Mirror of Paradise after the central vessel that makes up the core part of the flotilla, the market carries a variety of trinkets, tokens, Icons, hedge fruits and other treasures of the Hedge and Ironside that the vendors pick up in their travels.%0aWhile each vessel in the flotilla has its own crew, who often double as the vendors of the market, the market itself has only one Captain. Her past is full of shadows, with only glimpses known to the market's patrons: some believe that she was one of the Lost once but became so wrapped in debt owed to the denizens of the Hedge that she earned the mantle of Queen, while others say she is the facet of a True Fae that broke itself off from the whole to rule its own little fiefdom in the Hedge. Whatever the truth may be, one thing is certain: as long as one is within her domain her word is law, and woe betide those that break it.%0a%0aWhile the central ship does host a brig, being tossed into it is far too mundane a punishment for those who break the law – and something that most of the market's patrons could escape besides. Instead an inky black dot blossoms on an obvious portion of the offending party's body, oozing out through any covering placed over it. This mark is a sign of the Captain's displeasure, and can only be removed by fulfilling a task of her choosing to redeem themselves. Alternately the offender offer to serve as part of the flotilla's crew for a month, earning their keep and the right to have the mark removed. Of course, some don't return from such service, but the high seas are a cruel mistress on the best of days, let alone with the Wyrd stirring up the waves at its whims.%0a %0a%0a'''Market Laws''' %0a* Passage between vessels via rigging is reserved for vendors only.%0a* Any bearer of the Black Dot is to be ignored unless they request to be taken to the Captain for its removal.%0a* Those with red hair are to keep it covered at all times while at the Market.%0a%0a'''Notable Vessels''' %0a* Sea's Bounty: vessel made from flowering vines and strands of all sort of aquatic flora; goblin fruit and oddments%0a* The Soaring Gryphon: a brilliant white three-mast ship that almost glows of its own accord; clothing, hedgespun items and accessories.%0a* Vason's Luck: dark red woods that are somewhat warm to the touch; gambling, cage fighting and other matters of sport.%0a* Vagrant's Call: patchwork of various materials, hedgeborn and Ironside; scrap and salvage%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a(:include GameRef.Directoryhelp:)

One of said founders had ties to the Leaden Mirror through a paramour and the Court has been involved in the operations ever since, whether simply as staff or on the board of leadership; the current representative is a Wizened Muse by the name of [[Players/AngelicaCardoso|Angelica Cardoso]] who heads up the art program at the facility and helps to inspire the residents in fostering their creativity even in their twilight years.

A number of rooms line the back wall, each with its own purpose: one holds the official office for the Archivist, others are private reading rooms, and one of the more recent additions holds a nascent computer lab.  This room houses four computers brought in from the Ironside, connected to each other and the collection of scanned texts made available for research but not yet able to reach outside of the hollow.  Visitors are warned to make sure that the monitors are covered once not in use per the Archivist's orders, however; technology often gets testy in the Hedge, as most Lost eventually learn, and this step seems to keep the machines calm for the most part.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> Contrary to what most would expect, one of the most prominent Hollows held by the Spring Court houses a grand library tucked into the Hedge surrounding the more mundane library building in Coconut Grove.

The Silver Lining Freehold does their part to help maintain the trods that run through the hub along with the hub itself, although the local hobs handle the upkeep in their own way.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #006400' margin-top=0px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=25px width=250px height=350px%25https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/3/30/FFXIV_Phantom_Train_concept.jpg%0a%3c The Hub takes the form of an old-school train station platform with a massive hedge-steel train taking center stage, steam often wafting from the engine’s chimney and between ten and fifteen cars trailing behind it.  A few hob run stalls are dotted around the platform, selling the usual trappings one finds at a train station seen through the Wyrd’s lens - the newspapers in particular can be rather interesting - but the star of the show is naturally the train itself.%0a%3c %0a%3c The train is accessed through an entrance behind the engine, with doorways between the cars allowing for passage between them.  Each trod that connects through the crossroads passes through one car, with the gateways from the trod into the hub varying in form; one that involves passing through a brick wall, for example, has been dubbed the “9 ¾ entrance” by some Lost that are more up to date on modern culture.  Once travelers have entered the car they are free to remain on that trod and continue on through the gate on the other side of the car, or they can step off and head out onto the platform proper or change ‘lanes’ and enter another trod through a different car.%0a%3c %0a

Holiday seasons have passed and the time of gifts and family seems forever off even if only a mere month away. Fresh powder turns to trampled mush and snowmen are constantly melting with twisted expressions of grief. Willows weep from melting icicles and sing their sorrowful dirge on the wind causing the faint feeling of past joy that flees with the breeze. Grief rests heavy on everyone’s shoulders and no more so than in the Summer’s heat at Winter’s weakest. All the while the hedge ghosts lament and cling to those who enter for comfort. Typically Mother Hellen alone spends any amount of time here along with what caretakers help her with the hollow’s upkeep and all other Lost avoid it due to its unpleasant environment.%0a%3c %0a%3c This is in stark contrast to the Winter months when Winter is strong. Sorrow isn’t expressed, but lifted from all who enter; leaving room in visitors’ hearts for more pleasant emotions. The hedge ghosts no longer grieve nor cling to the living for comfort, making them more approachable if any chose to interact with them. Large flakes gracefully fall from the sky onto fresh powder and refresh any who manage to catch one on their tongue. Footsteps quickly find themselves covered over to smooth out the indentations%0a%3c %0a%3c During the holiday seasons, there is a large tree in the entrance courtyard which is lavishly decorated and all are welcome to come to lift their spirits. Many of the Winter courtiers stay at the edge during this time and oversee the celebrations of their fellows, both seen and unseen. Enjoying seeing the joy others are able to express and remind themselves as the Silent Arrow that their harsh work is worth it in the end.%0a%3c %0a%3c Beyond the courtyard is the castle of ice, although it’s more like a giant ski lodge once within. Warm fires in small and large rooms alike for private or public gathering. Hot chocolate and marshmallows with hot tomato soup for the soul for those looking to tickle their nostalgia or more exotic hedge variants, such as spiced babbleroot with whipped mist that garbles nonsensically as you drink it all the way down your throat to your stomach; causing one’s stomach to ‘talk’ for the next hour. No secrets are kept here so those that come are allowed to wander as they desire.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!''The Hollow of Silence''%0a%3c '''Gate Location''': A hum and a knock away \\%0a%3c '''Owned By''': Winter Court%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Spheres and Factions''' %0a%3c * Changeling%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Hooks''' %0a%3c * Where Secrets are Exchanged%0a%3c %0a%3c Much like the Hollow of Hospitality, during the off Winter seasons the ghosts seek out the living. Only these are not the normal harmless hedge ghosts that occupy the kinder Hollow. Angel and Mare are not as kind as their counterpart and have made deals with wraiths to guard them when they are at their weakest. Those without a Winter mantle are attacked on sight and for that reason, among others, it breaks the oath to the Winter court to bring in another courtier. Only Mother Hellen is exempt from this clause and times can be counted on one hand how often that has been a necessity since the motley’s reign.%0a%3c %0a%3c Upon entering, there is no place to hide in shadow or cover. The pathway to the stronghold of Winter’s halls lay open and exposed to the wraiths who silently line the walls lying in wait for the foolish. A deathly silence permeates this Hollow and even a whisper carries on the cold wind to ears unknown and any loud noise gathers the attention of others.%0a%3c %0a%3c When Winter’s reign begins, most of the wraiths are allowed to rest and the environment itself turns against anyone with a harsh blizzard. For this reason, typically one of the first contracts Winter Courtiers learn after taking their oath tends to be “Heart of Ice” if they spend any amount of time here. The non-oathed find out that the lack of wraiths is not a weakness in Winter’s defense. If they manage to get past the harsh environment without getting lost in the blinding blizzard, much harsher wards await within.%0a%3c %0a%3c Past the entrance is the main hall with private rooms for whispered conversations in warded privacy. All are told upon being shown these rooms not to expect privacy from the Monarch as he is keenly aware of the secrets whispered in his Hollow.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a---%0a> %0a> ----%0a>  %0a> !!%25center%25%25changeling%25''The Markets''%25%25%0a> %0a> !!!''The Lyric Market''%0a> '''Gate Location''': [[City/Central#toc9|Overtown]] \\%0a> '''Owned By''': Mister House%0a> %0a

A memorial of sorts, but not one for sorrowful moments of silence. This hall is always loud and, in a very Norse fashion, is filled with tables for feasts and comradery to tell stories of victory, with particular emphasis on the deeds of the fallen. Towards the back is a raised table reserved for the war council, also acting as the Queen’s throne to hear official matters. If there isn’t an official need, the ruling motley often sits with their brothers and sisters in arms at the other tables of the Hall.%0a%3c %0a%3c It is never more rowdy than in the summer with the fireplaces in the walls stoked to raging bonfires containing the Crimson Court’s wrath.

The main entrance to the network is a passage down through the firmament, the air within slowly thickening until it becomes nigh-impossible to take a breath. Crossing the threshold into the main chamber breaks the spell, albeit leaving the entrant with the lingering flicker of fear that suits the domain of the Autumn Court quite well indeed. Other entrances exist, of course, known by members of the Court and those who have garnered the appropriate amount of goodwill, and often connect to certain sections of the network: a grand library that houses the court’s gathered knowledge, chambers set aside for magical experimentation and quarters for courtiers or valued guests who do not have a place to stay on the Ironside. %0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c  %0a%3c !!!%25center%25''The Markets''%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!''The Lyric Market''%0a%3c '''Gate Location''': [[City/Central#toc9|Overtown]] \\%0a%3c '''Owned By''': Mister House%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Spheres and Factions''' %0a%3c * Changeling%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Hooks''' %0a%3c * Under New Management!%0a%3c * Caveat Emptor%0a%3c %0a%3c For one's daily needs the permanent goblin market located in the Hedge around Overtown will often do the trick, although getting into and out of the gate tucked in between a grocery store and the Lyric Theater can be sporting depending on the time of day due to the roughness of the neighborhood.

On the night of the new moon, however, a hedge gate opens wide on the larger of the two islands, granting those who pass through it access to a marvel of hobgoblin engineering and one of the largest known mobile Goblin Markets: a vast array of ships of various sizes, connected by a network of ladders, wooden bridges and rope netting that can be called warren-like at best. Known as the Mirror of Paradise after the central vessel that makes up the core part of the flotilla, the market carries a variety of trinkets, tokens, Icons, hedge fruits and other treasures of the Hedge and Ironside that the vendors pick up in their travels.%0a%3c While each vessel in the flotilla has its own crew, who often double as the vendors of the market, the market itself has only one Captain. Her past is full of shadows, with only glimpses known to the market's patrons: some believe that she was one of the Lost once but became so wrapped in debt owed to the denizens of the Hedge that she earned the mantle of Queen, while others say she is the facet of a True Fae that broke itself off from the whole to rule its own little fiefdom in the Hedge. Whatever the truth may be, one thing is certain: as long as one is within her domain her word is law, and woe betide those that break it.%0a%3c %0a%3c While the central ship does host a brig, being tossed into it is far too mundane a punishment for those who break the law – and something that most of the market's patrons could escape besides. Instead an inky black dot blossoms on an obvious portion of the offending party's body, oozing out through any covering placed over it. This mark is a sign of the Captain's displeasure, and can only be removed by fulfilling a task of her choosing to redeem themselves. Alternately the offender offer to serve as part of the flotilla's crew for a month, earning their keep and the right to have the mark removed. Of course, some don't return from such service, but the high seas are a cruel mistress on the best of days, let alone with the Wyrd stirring up the waves at its whims.%0a---%0a> * Loyalist Stronghold%0a> * Once a Gristle Hangout%0a> Embassy Seals %0a> * Loyalist-Owned (All)%0a> * Danger (All)%0a> %0a> %0a> Hayden Island Business Park is a large multi-tenant park with four buildings that house offices, industrial space, and small businesses.

It is, quite frankly, beautiful beyond what a human can imagine. The hedge around Portland is a lush riot of color, life, and creatures. It primarily takes the form of a mist filled old growth forest with trees on the small side stretching five feet wide and hundreds of feet tall. There are shades of green in the leaves and reds, purples, and blues in the fruit and flowers that simply don't exist on earth and that by all scientific logic human eyes shouldn't even be able to discern. Thin trods weave careful trails through the thorny undergrowth that grows between the massive trees, and Dream Bastions grow like butterfly chrysalis’ against the trees. %0a> %0a> It is easy to get lost in the twisting, misty paths that are rarely more than a deer trail barely wide enough for a human to walk on. It's wild, virgin land and it is extremely rare for larger paths to be cut through it. When travelers do come across a wide, or even paved trod like St. John’s Trod, they can be sure it wasn't any of the local denizens of the Hedge who made it. Local hobs tend to be quiet, careful creatures of earth and air who avoid changelings for the most part. That is not to say they are not dangerous. Many hobs are violently territorial, and dangerously cunning. They are best avoided if possible, and bribed into a peaceful resolution if not.%0a> %0a> All public hedge gates are marked with the following Embassy Seals.%0a> * Dangerous (All)%0a> * Changeling-Protected (All)%0a> %0a> %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> %0a> ----%0a>  %0a> !!!%25center%25''The Market''%0a> %25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #006400' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=500px height=500px%25https://i.imgur.com/b0tHVW5.png%0a>   %0a> '''District''': [[Hedge]] \\%0a> '''Gate Location''': Cathedral Park \\%0a> '''Owned By''': Hobgoblins%0a> %0a> '''Spheres and Factions''' %0a> * Changeling%0a> '''Hooks''' %0a> * Be careful what you wish for%0a> * Everything is for sale, nothing is forbidden%0a> %0a> %0a> The hob goblins hold a market every week, though the day varies seemingly at random. Though the day and time changes, the location is always the same. Entering the Cathedral Gate onto St. John’s Trod, Changelings hike about five minutes and then turn left onto a razor thin trod where the Thorns grow so close they pluck at travelers’ hair and clothing. Left and left, and left again at every turn, and two hours later the Lost emerge into a small plaza set with wooden stalls. It seems an ancient square but a closer look reveals a mirror of downtown Portland- if the buildings were being devoured by enormous trees, vines, velvet moss covered the streets, and brilliantly flowering thorns filled the side streets and alleys.%0a> %0a>  %0a> At each boundary of the Market a wooden sign is erected, and on it are painted the Laws of the Market accompanied by several seemingly meaningless glyphs. “No Violence. No Contracts. No Refunds. All Deals Are Final. All Deals Must Be Honored.” A humanoid figure that looks as if it has walked out of a classic Spaghetti Western, one of the many Deputies, lurks close to each sign. Nobody can enter without first touching the sign and accept the Law by paying a point of Glamour.%0a> %0a>  %0a> !!!!Changelings in The Market%0a>  %25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #006400' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=500px height=500px%25https://pre00.deviantart.net/e8f2/th/pre/i/2015/113/a/e/roman_overgrowth_by_ultragriffy-d8qr3ek.jpg%0a> %0a> Changelings are not unwelcome, but they are not welcomed either- there is only quiet tolerance as long as the changeling goes about their business without causing trouble. More than one loud-mouthed freeholder hasn&rsquo;t come back from the market in the past.%0a> %0a>  %0a> !!!!Regular Stalls%0a>  %0a> '''Pearl's''' is in many ways the vibrant heart of the Market. It’s a marble building that looks pulled from the 1800's with lovely arched windows, window boxes with carnivorous plants in them, and black marble trim.  Balconies jut out from the building while brightly colored cloth roofs shield from the elements.  Walking in the front door reveals an old west styled classy saloon or hotel bar. Madame Pearl sells delightful food and drink, rents whores, and hosts gambling. She also trades in information as well as the most rare of objects.  If you want something from Arcadia this is the place to go. In one corner there is a strange piano that customers can take turns to play tunes upon and songs from classic cowboy films from the era get the best response.%0a> %0a> The Sheriff and his Deputies patrol through the saloon quite often. Madam Pearl herself is stunning and seductive, with vivid blue hair and eyes like pearls. She should always be wearing something fabulous and hedgespun.  The back of the saloon leads to her hollow: a place like a modern club made with ice.  Not many are permitted into her sanctum however.  She has a few changeling pets she keeps near her at all times save for when she's doing business.%0a> %0a>  %0a> '''Sabrina, The Old Witch''', has a mysterious tent nestled in a corner of the Market – across whose black fabric dance constellations of stars. Her skin has a blue tinge while her hair is long and midnight blue. She wears the traditional Black Hat on her head. She sounds wise and enigmatic and her words often imply she is offering more than she actually is. Perhaps once she was young and beautiful, but now she is both old and ageless. She is a specialist in Contracts, Dreams and all things Magical.%0a> %0a>  %0a> '''The Rummage''' is a collected of stalls manned by what seems to be a small family of hobs. Half a dozen small, brown and furry hobs fuss over a collection of trestle tables on which a seemingly random collection of items are displayed. Many of the items appear like junk, but every one of them has a story attached and some unseen value as a Hedgespun component. There are also various second-hand Hedgespun items and tokens. Their voices are quite high and they mostly speak in a language incomprehensible to all but each other – with fragments of pidgin English.  One hob in particular seems to be in charge of things.  It seems to have multiple personalities that shift between a southern bell sister, a rockabilly brother, a tentative little brother, and more: all with just the change of a hat or clothes.%0a> %0a>  %0a> '''Ye Olde Forge''' is run by a trio of burly dwarves, all seemingly brothers. Various weapons and armor, both mundane and Hedgespun, hang nailed into the walls and arranged on a trestle table at the front of the stall. Behind it, a fire burns impossibly brightly and two of the brothers will always be working at the anvil. A third may stop to deal with customers at times, but it always feels like they want to get back to work.%0a> %0a> %0a> The Market Laws are protected by '''The Sheriff and his Deputies'''. They appear like the cast of a Spaghetti Western, all sullen attitude and six-shooters. They tend not to speak to the Lost and rumors circulate that the Sheriff is an adversary that nobody should want to face.  Their faces are decidedly inhuman though.

Madame Pearl sells delightful food and drink, rents whores, and hosts gambling. She also trades in information as well as the most rare of objects.  If you want something from Arcadia this is the place to go. In one corner there is a strange piano that customers can take turns to play tunes upon – always songs that would be found in classic cowboy movies. The Sheriff and his Deputies patrol through the saloon quite often. Madam Pearl herself is stunning and seductive, with vivid blue hair and eyes like pearls. She should always be wearing something fabulous and hedgespun.  The back of the saloon leads to her hollow: a place like a modern club made with ice.  Not many are permitted into her sanctum however.

That family has since moved on and the manor has changed hands a few times, eventually becoming a classic styled inn.  It didn't do well and was soon converted into a place for theater, escape rooms, and game nights.  It flourished for a time but due to mismanagement it went out of business.  Now the House is open once again with updated games, a zombie survival night, classic monster movie night, and a mysterious new owner.  The House still offers room and board to experience a fun atmosphere for a night along with scary games and encounters with the strange in a controlled way.%0a%3c  %0a%3c == Supernatural ==%0a%3c  %0a%3c What isn't common knowledge is that this is the seat of the [[Court of Autumn]].  As Portland's old courts die, new ones are blooming with new leadership and new opportunity.  The Court of Fear isn't an unwelcoming place.  Your heart may race but you'll leave again just a measure stronger.  %0a%3c %0a%3c Changelings are always welcome and may find room and board here.  It's still recommended that Lost show discretion among it's old hallways as a mortal may be staying the night but what better way to enjoy some delightful, fear driven glamour.  Members of other factions are welcome to stay as well though they must adhere to good etiquette.%0a

There doesn’t seem to be any magical significance to one particular location over another though some individuals get superstitious that a particular site might be ‘lucky’ for their court over another. The requirements for the ritual are that it is on the shore of a body of water. Kelley Point Park is often preferred though the shores and even docks of the Columbia and Willamette Rivers have been used in the past. The Smith and Bybee Wetlands is also a possibility.%0a%3c %0a%3c Supernatural%0a%3c A Bonfire site is constructed once a quarter to host the freehold’s Bulwark Ritual.

Its key is to walk beneath each of the arches on the northeast side, and then continue down to the water. In the reflection of the water, St. John’s Trod appears, and any may step through into it. St. John’s Trod is the main thoroughfare of the local hedge and though many useful trails and trods through the thorns branch off from it, if it is followed directly, it will lead the traveler directly to the gates of Arcadia.%0a%3c %0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Court Corner Books%0a%3c District: North%0a%3c Neighborhood: University Park%0a%3c Owned By: Court of the Forteans%0a%3c %0a%3c Spheres and Factions%0a%3c Business%0a%3c Shadow%0a%3c Changeling%0a%3c Hooks%0a%3c Occult Bookstore%0a%3c Mirrored in Other Realms%0a%3c Embassy Seals%0a%3c Danger (All)%0a%3c Changeling Territory (All)%0a%3c Fortean Court (Changeling)%0a%3c Court Corner Books is a tiny little sliver of a business that appears to have been built by putting a roof and store front in an alley. It’s old, grungy, and has a perpetually dismal air that makes it seem as if it’s closed. When University Park locals actually notice it is still technically open, they’re shocked because people never seem to actually visit it much less buy anything from it. Locals instinctively avoid it and entire block it occupies, particularly when it’s raining. The shelves inside are organized in a twisting, maze-like fashion tightly packed with books and other oddities. The inventory is carefully organized with a classic card catalog behind the front desk but the stock is covered in a thick layer of undisturbed dust.%0a%3c %0a%3c Supernatural%0a%3c When precipitation is in the air, as it is 154 days a year on average, there’s a subtle shifting of ways within Court Corner Books. The maze of shelves expands and reaches out to even stranger places. An inattentive reader might wander into the hedge upon turning a corner, through a mirror, or into even stranger realms. The Forteans maintain careful custody of the bookstore and visitors are generally not allowed beyond the front desk unless they are member or allies of the Court.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Hedge%0a%3c When the maze of shelves opens up into the hedge, it generally leads into the thorns unless a market is travelling through the area.

Thin trods weave careful trails through the thorny undergrowth that grows between the massive trees, and Dream Bastions grow like butterfly chrysalis’ against the trees. It is easy to get lost in the twisting, misty paths that are rarely more than a deer trail barely wide enough for a human to walk on. It’s wild, virgin land and it is extremely rare for larger paths to be cut through it. When travelers do come across a wide, or even paved trod like St. John’s Trod, they can be sure it wasn’t any of the local denizens of the Hedge who made it. Local hobs tend to be quiet, careful creatures of earth and air who avoid changelings for the most part. That is not to say they are not dangerous. Many hobs are violently territorial, and dangerously cunning. They are best avoided if possible, and bribed into a peaceful resolution if not.	%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c The Market%0a%3c District: Hedge%0a%3c Gate Location: Cathedral Park%0a%3c Owned By: Hobgoblins%0a%3c %0a%3c Spheres and Factions%0a%3c Changeling%0a%3c Hooks%0a%3c Be careful what you wish for…%0a%3c Everything is for sale, nothing is forbidden%0a%3c The hob goblins hold a market every week, though the day varies seemingly at random. Though the day and time changes, the location is always the same. Entering the Cathedral Gate onto St. John’s Trod, Changelings hike about five minutes and then turn left onto a razor thin trod where the Thorns grow so close they pluck at travelers’ hair and clothing. Left and left, and left again at every turn, and two hours later the Lost emerge into a small plaza set with wooden stalls. It seems an ancient square but a closer look reveals a mirror of downtown Portland- if the buildings were being devoured by enormous trees, vines, velvet moss covered the streets, and brilliantly flowering thorns filled the side streets and alleys.%0a%3c %0a%3c At each boundary of the Market a wooden sign is erected, and on it are painted the Laws of the Market accompanied by several seemingly meaningless glyphs. “No Violence. No Contracts. No Refunds. All Deals Are Final. All Deals Must Be Honored.” A humanoid figure that looks as if it has walked out of a classic Spaghetti Western, one of the many Deputies, lurks close to each sign. Nobody can enter without first touching the sign and accept the Law by paying a point of Glamour.%0a%3c %0a%3c Changelings in The Market%0a%3c Changelings are not unwelcome, but they are not welcomed either- there is only quiet tolerance as long as the changeling goes about their business without causing trouble. More than one loud-mouthed freeholder hasn’t come back from the market in the past.%0a%3c %0a%3c Regular Stalls%0a%3c Madame Pearl’s is in many ways the vibrant heart of the Market. It’s an old, Western Saloon. Madame Pearl sells delightful food & drink, rents whores and, hosts gambling. She also trades in information. In one corner there is a strange piano that customers take turns to play tunes upon – always songs that would be found in classic cowboy movies. The Sheriff and his Deputies are usually here. Madam Pearl herself is stunning and seductive, with vivid red hair and eyes like pearls. She should always be wearing something fabulous and hedgespun.%0a%3c %0a%3c Sabrina, The Old Witch, has a mysterious tent nestled in a corner of the Market – across whose black fabric dance constellations of stars. Her skin has a blue tinge while her hair is long and midnight blue. She wears the traditional Black Hat on her head. She sounds wise and enigmatic and her words often imply she is offering more than she actually is. Perhaps once she was young and beautiful, but now she is both old and ageless. She is a specialist in Contracts, Dreams and all things Magical.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Rummage is a collected of stalls manned by what seems to be a small family of hobs. Half a dozen small, brown and furry hobs fuss over a collection of trestle tables on which a seemingly random collection of items are displayed. Many of the items appear like junk, but every one of them has a story attached and some unseen value as a Hedgespun component. There are also various second-hand Hedgespun items and tokens. Their voices are quite high and they mostly speak in a language incomprehensible to all but each other – with fragments of pidgin English.%0a%3c %0a%3c Ye Olde Forge is run by a trio of burly dwarves, all seemingly brothers. Various weapons and armor, both mundane and Hedgespun, hang nailed into the walls and arranged on a trestle table at the front of the stall. Behind it, a fire burns impossibly brightly and two of the brothers will always be working at the anvil. A third may stop to deal with customers at times, but it always feels like they want to get back to work.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Market Laws are protected by The Sheriff and his Deputies. They appear like the cast of a Spaghetti Western, all sullen attitude and six-shooters. They tend not to speak to the Lost and rumors circulate that the Sheriff is an adversary that nobody should want to face.
