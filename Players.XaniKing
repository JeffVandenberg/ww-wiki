From her lower back and crawling around and up her back are several beautifully shaded varying tribal sea turtles done in black work only. The turtles crawl towards her right shoulder blade which draws the eyes to her left shoulder blade where a stunning crescent moon looks almost haunted due to the remarkable artistic shading put into the piece that has been wrapped by a tribal triquetra. This piece has been positioned as if it was protecting her heart from behind. %0a%0aAlong her left shoulder, one can see the white scarring of jagged teeth marks. Left to one's imagination the image of a vicious animal attack can come to mind or if you know her history maybe she ended up tangling with something in the ocean. Older scarring can be noticed if one is paying attention to her right leg as well with the easier identifier of suture marks and a jagged form about mid-way between her knee and hip. Other scars are also evident depending on what she's wearing.  %0a-----%0a%25cfloat margin-left=10px width=920px%25 http://imgur.com/9iqGe2k.png%0a-----%0a!Role Play Hooks%0a-----%0a[++The Mundane++] %0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #707070' margin-right=50px  width=300px%25 http://imgur.com/5CYfcb9.jpg%0a* '''Stay in Motion''' – A dance studio opened up on the edge of Marshall Park last year.
