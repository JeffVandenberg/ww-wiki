He left with little more than the clothes on his back, a refugee for the second time in his life.  The first time had been fleeing from Castro’s Cuba.  He vowed to himself and the gods that he never again would be forced to flee his home.  In fact, he made his mission to return to the home he had built in Miami and to punish those who forced him from it.  Adrian is the one who kept the scattered Circle of Miami together in those years of exile.  He coordinated their return and led the fight from the front lines.%0a%0aNow he is Heirophant.  He devotedly worships his gods of war, but he shows little interest in spiritually leading the covenant.  That role falls to others.  He leads the covenant in war.  In protecting its interests and territories.  No slight goes unchallenged.  No encroachment is unpunished.  The Acolytes of Miami will remain vigilant and they will never forget, not as long as Adrian Lopez leads them%0a%0a%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25vampire%25'''Hooks'''%0a%0a!!!!%25vampire%25 ''No Hobbies (All):'' %0aAdrian is known for his singular focus on fulfilling his vow to the gods to defend the Circle and avenge those who fell in the purge.
