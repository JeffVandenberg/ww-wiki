He speaks slowly as if he spends a lot of time thinking about what he wants to say, but he is always clear in both tone, volume and choice of wording.%0a%0aIf you engage the vampire in a number of topics he’ll happily spend hours talking about it down to the minutiae of whatever it is got you talking in the first place. .\\%0a%0a!%25vampire%25 History:\\%0a%0aWalter keeps some details of his past close to his heart but there are plenty of details that can be gleaned from conversations he’s had.%0a%0aHe’s been a vampire for a long time with mentions of surprise at just how ubiquitous electric lights are these nights or his thoughts regarding race and gender.%0a%0aIt also seems he’s been a member of the First Estate since the beginning of his Requiem but details are sketchy lost to the mists of time and decay of records. Still he’s Sired several Childer by his own admission, founded a Dynasty and House. And according to him it’s all gone now or at least he has yet to find any of his childer to this night.%0a%0aHis relationship to the Lance is a simple one for Kindred that have been around for a long time. Although Walter is a supporter of the Lance and it’s agenda’s spend enough time with him and the question of his faith in Longinus might have you wonder how he was ever anointed as Priest. Still he can talk at length of the Testament, it’s various interpretations and changes over the centuries and that’s doesn’t even touch on his academic knowledge of the miracles of Theban Sorcery or his storehouses of volumes on related subjects.%0a%0aNow how did he end up in Portland? His answer is simple, “I’ve never been, I’ve heard that it’s an interesting place and more importantly there’s a chance that I can find some information on my errant Childer here” %0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=17px margin-right=16px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=8px width=315%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a!%25vampire%25  Hooks:%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=17px margin-right=16px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=8px width=315 newwin%25https://imgur.com/fg9DmJt.jpg\\%0a%0a%0a%25vampire%25 '''New Arrival (Sorta)''' (Everyone) - %25white%25 Walter is new to Portland, seemingly having abandoned his footholds in Europe for one reason or another.

Still he’s Sired several Childer by his own admission, founded a Dynasty and House. And according to him it’s all gone now or at least he has yet to find any of his childer to this night.%0a%3c %0a%3c His relationship to the Lance is a simple one for Kindred that have been around for a long time. Although Walter is a supporter of the Lance and it’s agenda’s spend enough time with him and the question of his faith in Longinus might have you wonder how he was ever anointed as Priest. Still he can talk at length of the Testament, it’s various interpretations and changes over the centuries and that’s doesn’t even touch on his academic knowledge of the miracles of Theban Sorcery or his storehouses of volumes on related subjects.%0a%3c %0a%3c Now how did he end up in Portland? His answer is simple, “I’ve never been, I’ve heard that it’s an interesting place and more importantly there’s a chance that I can find some information on my errant Childer here” %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=17px margin-right=16px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=8px width=315 newwin%25https://media.giphy.com/media/xSkee4mZbq2Gc/giphy.gif%0a%3c %0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c !%25vampire%25  Hooks:%0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=17px margin-right=16px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=8px width=315 newwin%25http://img2.rnkr-static.com/user_node_img/108/2153953/870/taylor-momsen-recording-artists-and-groups-photo-u43.jpg\\%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25vampire%25 '''New Arrival (Sorta)''' (Everyone) - %25white%25 Walter is new to Portland, seemingly having abandoned his footholds in Europe for one reason or another.
