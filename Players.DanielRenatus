Currently there are only a few members, but maybe you’ve heard of them, at least.%0a%0a!!!Enlightened of the Heralds of the Void (Any prospective members!)%0a%0aDaniel is the current member of the Renatus Dynasty who’s been put in charge of the [[Heralds of the Void]], a cult (cooperative group, as he'd put it IC) that acts as the Kindred’s supernatural ‘arm’ into the wider occult world. They preach a sort of unresistricted enlightenment, focused on improving ones supernatural potency and awareness, and are always seeking new members capable of contributing to their goals.\\%0a%0a%0aOf course, not everyone’s so directly brought in. Sometimes, you might instead hear about the man who runs the [[City.HomesteadCommunityCenter|Homestead Community Center]] being someone capable of helping out those that have some sort of ‘oddity’ that they can’t otherwise deal with (despite the fact that the Community Center was closed years ago)…%0a%0a!!!ECP Curator (Embassy-aligned)%0a%0aDaniel's recently become the official Curator of the [[City.EmbassyContainmentProject| Embassy Containment Project]], an idea he came up with for mutual storage, research, and acquisition of supernatural oddities that cross Faction boundaries (or that anyone just wants additional help with beyond their Faction to begin with). He's currently the one who decides who gains access to what, so if you want to be a Researcher, or just want to submit something for the Embassy to keep contained, he's the one to talk to. %0a%0a!!!%25mortal%25Mortal Emissary (Vampire, Mortal+)%0a%0aDaniel has been named the Vampiric ‘Emissary’ to the Rose City Guild and the Mortal faction as a whole. If you need something relating to them, he’s the one to talk to first.%0a%0a!!!Occult Community (All!)%0a%0aEven outside the Cult, Daniel’s often seen fairly frequently at the various more ‘reputable’ occult shops and bookstores around the city.%0a%0a!!!%25vampire%25Nest Scholar (Ordo Dracul)%0a%0aHaving headed an expedition into one of the more potent Wyrm’s Nests within the southwest side of the city, Daniel’s known to have an eye for Wyrm’s Nests and a mind for utilizing them. Those within the Ordo may know he helped establish a Crucible for his coterie in the aforementioned Nest.%0a%0a!!!%25vampire%25Master of the Dying Light (Ordo Dracul)%0a%0a!!!%25vampire%25Ordo Dracul Primogen%0a%0a!!!Magical Curiosity (All Supernaturally inclined)%0a%0aIt’s quite likely Daniel’s interest in supernatural powers, especially those one might classify as ‘magic’, is known to at least a few. He’s constantly working to attempt to learn as much as he can about how other forms of power function, in the hopes of one day learning to mimic such capabilities. %0a%0a----%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/DwNGYUN.png%0a%0a*“Quote” - Someone%0a%0a*%25mortal%25“He got in my head and now he just won’t leave. I’m not entirely displeased.” Madam Director%0a%0a*%25vampire%25“He has a strong will, a keen intelligence, and an ability to lead people with just his sense of purpose. I have no doubt that whatever his plans are, he will see them to fruition. I just hope those plans aren’t as terrifying as I think they are.” Mustang%0a%0a*%25vampire%25 “He’s younger than I am, but somehow I don’t know if I’d make it long without Daniel. He grounds me and for that he means the world to me and if you fuck with him I’ll fuck you up. Just ask the girl I frenzied on when I thought she was making fun of him.” - Greer Renatus%0a%0a*%25changeling%25“He’s a nice guy, a good leader, I don’t mind working for him, and following his lead. Sometimes he needs a reminder to feed, but well, we all need a bit of help, sometimes.” - Arianna Lockhearth%0a%0a*%25color=#ff00ff%25“He’s an amazing teacher, charismatic leader, brilliant thinker, and wonderful friend. He has my trust completely. I was scared of my powers when I joined but now I feel confident in them due to his guidance. He can help many people with their own powers too, I’m sure.” - [[Ryuko Saito]]%0a%0a*%25werewolf%25“He has qualities that are impressive-even envious - vision, intelligence, the absolute devotion of his followers. However, in direct observation, I see the blind spots, and wonder if he can see mine…keep the lines of communication open, Mr. Renatus. I think we have things we could teach each other.” - [[Frankie Hayes]]%0a%0a*%25vampire%25“Typically they say, don’t go changing, but I hope you do a little. Change an accept me for who I am. I’m not the people I associate with. We have been by each other’s side so many times. We know more about each other than many can fathom. Let me show you that I am not them. Let me show you that we are still friends. It’s asking a lot to ask you to bend. But I think you can. But if you can’t know you will always have a place in my heart and I will not forget all that we’ve done. I will remember it fondly.” Ms. Ana%0a%0a*%25vampire%25“You are still a mystery to me Mr. Renatus, but know this - in my eyes, you are no coward.” - [[Esme Wallson|Alder Wilkinson]]%0a%0a*%25mage%25“Did you see him at the kangaroo court I mean trial? He was the least passionate one up there. That’s the mark of someone who knows no matter what they’re in control. The others were blustering, yelling, cussing, threatening war. Daniel he just stood his ground. Fear this man unequivocally, fear him. Anyone that can keep their head in a crowd like that is a real leader and real leaders are always the ones who get their own ends met.” - Truth,Leknaat%0a%0a*%25changeling%25''"Good, true friend.

They preach a sort of ‘at whatever cost’ enlightenment, focused on improving ones supernatural potency and awareness, and are always seeking new members capable of contributing to their goals.\\%0a%3c Of course, not everyone’s so directly brought in.

If you need something relating to them, he’s the one to talk to first.%0a%3c Occult Community (All!)%0a%3c %0a%3c Even outside the Cult, Daniel’s often seen fairly frequently at the various more ‘reputable’ occult shops and bookstores around the city.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Nest Scholar (Ordo Dracul)%0a%3c %0a%3c Having headed an expedition into one of the more potent Wyrm’s Nests within the southwest side of the city, Daniel’s known to have an eye for Wyrm’s Nests and a mind for utilizing them.
