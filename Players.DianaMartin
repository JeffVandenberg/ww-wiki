Miss Notary Martin seems to have this mastered.&rdquo; — Samuel Walker%0a%3c %0a%3c * &ldquo;When I look at Notary Martin I see just a hint of myself. I believe we may have more in common than either of us let on. I look forward to interacting with her further and potentially doing a bit of business.&rdquo; — Esme Wilkinson%0a%3c %0a%3c * &ldquo;At last, I found something that doesn’t bore me. Talking with her makes my evenings and gives me something to look forward to.&rdquo; — James Mendo%0a%3c %0a%3c * &ldquo;She’s helped those I hold dear. She’s helped those she doesn’t know. Her gaze melts my panties, which is slightly problematic at the moment, but, I love when she stares at me.&rdquo; — Anastasia Walker%0a%3c %0a%3c * &ldquo;Smart gal, which is no surprise. Invictus is many things, but as an institution they don’t shelter dumbasses. What’s more interestin’ is if ya talk to her, she’s surprisingly open minded. Almost progressive, at least by fuckin’ Vick standards. The only thing that keeps her from maybe bein’ a truly enlightened sorta chick is a deep, overwhelmin’ regard for her own self interest. If her outlook can’t be changed, it can be exploited.&rdquo; — Harvey Wallson%0a%3c %0a%3c * &ldquo;Notary Diana Martin, she is the type of woman that could sell sand at the beach. Cunning. But I want to make her deadly as well. And when I want something I don’t stop until I get it. She will be deadly, her Rapier will taste flesh and never be satisfied.&rdquo; — Lexington Adalwolf%0a%3c %0a%3c * &ldquo;She’s clever, polite, but a hell of a lot more dangerous than she seems. Not sure if she likes me or puts up with me. But she’s friends with Walker, so I guess I gotta do my best to impress. Let’s see if I can meet her standards.&rdquo; — Korey Danvers%0a%3c %0a%3c * &ldquo;She’s an excellent boss. I’ve found working under her to be quite rewarding. She has very high standards but she doesn’t expect anything she doesn’t offer in spades. She’s hardworking and with a brilliant mind. I love watching her work.&rdquo; — Lorelei Bowen%0a%3c %0a%3c * &ldquo;I mean, my opinion holds no sway. You know how it is. But if you want to know, then I’d say that I respect the fact that she collects the viewpoints of those around her when she makes a decision. Very often seen folks in her kind of position with heads too big for those kind of smarts.; — Noah Levi%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25http://i80.photobucket.com/albums/j192/conniechan47_pics/f43f13ec-8eaa-4d47-8680-8e1512539db2_zps8mddvs7u.jpg%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
