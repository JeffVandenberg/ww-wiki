'''Please refrain from submitting Items/Powers you are not able to use yourself.'''%0a**From the Request Tool create a Custom Item/Power type request for the Group: Rules Master.%0a**Use the Template for the type of item you’re creating (or if you’re making something completely new, use the recommendations in the book for information to provide)%0a***Privacy: The power/item should be listed as Public or Private in the writeup. Private means only the character that created it can use it, or those they’ve directly taught. Public means anyone may learn it (due to it being freely taught or the methodology spread around). Both will be listed on the wiki, for ease of access, but will have their ‘privacy’ noted.%0a*The Rules Master will then either approve it, work with the player to balance it out, or deny it if it simply can’t be done with the level or power(s) given.%0a%0aOnce approved, the power or item must be developed IC:%0a*Specify in the same request whether your character is hoping to build (i.e., craft) the item or power or retrieve the item or power.%0a*Power/Item types that provide a creation system in the books are created with the systems provided. In addition, a single scene or bluebook must be provided as Justification, involving some aspect of the creation process. Scenes do not need to involve an ST.%0a**Note: System required dice rolls should be attached to the request.%0a*In the case of power or item types that don’t have a concrete system, a number of Justifications must be provided equal to the level of the item/power. These can include scenes (with or without an ST), bluebooks, applicable merit uses (discussed with the Rules Master), and extended rolls (discussed with the Rules Master. Only successful rolls apply, of course). A scene or blue book MUST be one of the chosen Justifications.%0a**Retrieval: In the case of custom items that a character would like to ‘find’ or otherwise physically acquire in-character, the above Justification system is still used, representing the process of researching and seeking it out, but needing to involve a Scene run by an ST for actually acquiring the item (though this may be done via PRP). Retrievals are never Private.%0a*Once Justified, the item/power is sent back to the Rules Master for purchase (assuming you have the Experience), at which point it will be added to the wiki.%0a*Only one custom item/power may be submitted per character at a time.%0a%0a!!%25center%25'''Customizable Traits'''%0a%0aThe following is a list, by Faction, of what can be custom-made with the above system.

Those that can 'partially' shift their throats and vocal chords into that shape, while retaining the ability to speak normally, such as with Life 3's 'Transform Life', can speak 'fluently' with no rolls. %0a%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''Changeling and Fae-Touched'''%25%25%0a[[#from3]]%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Chrysalis''%0a%0aThe following abilities may have successes spent on them by Changelings using Chrysalis:%0a%0aFor each size above the creature’s base, a success can be spent to improve its Strength and Stamina by 1.

Some use it with a delicate, barely perceptible touch to nudge people into action while others use a heavy handed approach to puppet someone into whipping a crowd up into a frenzy. The Court of Beirut keeps this contract as a strictly held secret amongst its courtiers and anyone who shares knowledge of it outside of the court is often considered a traitor.%0a%0a:Cost: 1 Glamour%0a%0a:Dice Pool: Manipulation + Socialize + Wyrd vs. Resolve + Wyrd%0a%0a:Action: Instant%0a%0a'''Roll Results''' %0a%0a*'''Dramatic Failure:''' The attempt at Subversion lashes back against the courtier and the changeling gains the Swooned Condition to whomever he was attempting to subvert.%0a*'''Failure:''' The mental coercion is thrown off or deflected.%0a*'''Success:''' The courtier manages to impose her will on another with a touch, and applies the Subverted condition to their victim which allows her to control their words for a scene or until the condition is resolved.%0a*'''Exceptional Success:''' It’s not always obvious when someone is pulling the strings of a situation, and on an exceptional success the courtier gains their Mantle as a bonus to social rolls against victims of the Subverted condition.%0a*''Beast:'' Instead of inserting their own words when they subvert someone, a Beast removes their capacity for intelligible speech entirely. Whenever the victim tries to speak they can only make wild and animalistic sounds.%0a*''Darkling:'' Darklings automatically gain the benefits of an exceptional success when using the Contract against someone who trusts them.%0a*''Wizened:'' Wizened replaced pieces of themselves that were lost and when they achieve an exceptional success they can do the same to another. While their victim is Subverted, the Changeling may adjust their perception of events as they happen and the False Memories condition is applied.%0a%0a:Catch: The Courtier is using the contact to force someone to tell the truth.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''New Condition: Subverted''%0a%0aYour will hasn’t been crushed or suppressed, someone else’s has weaseled in and replaced it with their own.

The Contact of the Third Pillar is a ritual which can be used to support and strengthen any supernatural effect performed by another. It is the source of the Court’s strength- where they work together, few can stand against them. If the supernatural power is an instant action, the Contract must be activated before the action is made.%0a%0a:Cost: 1 Glamour%0a%0a:Dice Pool: Intelligence + Occult + Wyrd%0a%0a:Action: Instant or Extended, determined by the primary action’s length.%0a%0a'''Roll Results'''%0a%0a*'''Dramatic Failure:''' The ritual fails spectacularly and the backlash of the Wyrd causes the magic it was supporting to dramatically fail too, which the changeling suffers.%0a*'''Failure:''' The ritual fails but it does not harm the magic it was supporting.%0a*'''Success:''' The Third Pillar ritual is a success, and the counts the changeling as a secondary actor in a teamwork roll for a supernatural power whether it is a contract, merit, or other power or ability. Each success rolled + mantle gives the primary actor a bonus die.%0a*'''Exceptional Success:''' The primary actor is filled with the beauty and Wonder of the Wyrd and the Fortean Court, and receives the Inspired condition.%0a*''Elemental:'' Elementals have shed their ego and without it getting in the way have a natural affinity for the ritual. They gain a +3 bonus to their roll.%0a*''Ogre:'' Ogres are a pillar of strength in a very physical manner. They may choose the higher of Strength or Intelligence when activating the Contract.%0a*''Wizened:'' Wizened who incorporate a mystical tool in their ritual- a hedgespun wand, a Token, or even a Mage’s dedicated tool also imbue the power of the ritual into the tool and gain their successes as a bonus to a single roll when using the tool in another fashion during the scene.%0a%0a:Catch: Another member of the Fortean Court is the primary actor.%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''Goblin Contracts'''%25%25%0a%0a----%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Centipede’s Delight''%0a%0a:Public/Private: Public %0a%0aGoblins are not bound to coventional physiology and often have impossible and illogical numbers of appendages, be it hands, legs, fingers, or arms in order to ensnare, exploit, and escape. With this Contract, Changelings can gain a number of extra arms themselves to aid in overcoming obstacles %0a%0a:Cost: 2 Glamour%0a%0a:Dice Pool: Dexterity+Athletics+Wyrd%0a%0a:Action: Instant %0a%0a'''Roll Results'''%0a%0a*'''Dramatic Failure:'''The hands emerge from the Changeling with a will of their own and they ply all manner of mischief from unbukling pants, to throwing items, to making obscene gestures. The Changeling takes &#8722;3 to all physical rolls actions as the hands cause distractions %0a*'''Failure:''' The Contract Fails %0a*'''Success:'''The Changeling grows one to for arms which they can control instinctively for the duration of one scene. The arms may be dismissed at any time before the end of the scene. They receive +3 to all rolls to grapple or utilize upper body strength in Athletics rolls such climbing, swimming, or pulling. %0a*'''Exceptional Success''':The Changeling’s arms last the rest of the night, and can be activated as an Instant Action.%0a %0a:Catch: The Changeling carries on their person a vial of legs from a creature with more than four legs. %0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Devil’s Own Luck''%0a%0a:Public/Private: Public%0a*What happens when you have a luck obsessed cat bargaining with an eldritch embodiment of the Void? Why, the devil’s own luck, of course.%0a%0a:Cost: 1 Glamour%0a%0a:Dice Pool: Wits + Occult + Wyrd%0a%0a:Action: Instant%0a%0a'''Roll Results'''%0a%0a*'''Dramatic Failure''': The changeling lose 10-again and any beneficial dice tricks (8-again, 9-again, rote, auto-successes) for the rest of the scene. %0a*'''Failure:''' Target finds a penny on the ground.%0a*'''Success:''' Target gains the Charmed Condition, as per Mage. This cannot provide beats.%0a*'''Exceptional Success:''' The target gains the Charmed Condition. In addition to the usual effects, the target may resolve the Charmed Condition for 8-again on a mundane roll.%0a%0a:Loophole: The target trades good luck for bad, and gains the Shaken Condition. The target cannot resolve the Charmed Condition, nor can the changeling use this Contract again, until this Shaken Condition is resolved.%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''Tokens'''%25%25%0a%0a----%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Cat’s Eye Pendant (•)''%0a%0a:Public/Private: Public%0a%0aA rare gemstone that’s actually only recently been discovered in the past century, Alexandrite has nevertheless become the source of much speculation and story telling, believing that carrying a piece of cat’s eyes will bestow a measure of the luck and health of the feline race upon the wearer. The Cat’s Eye is a piece of jewelry, set with a stunning amber alexandrite with chatoyancy, creating a cat’s eye effect. Exposure of the gemstone to the wild magic of the fae brings a measure of the story to the gemstones, bringing a measure of feline to the gem, and to the wearer. %0a%0aThose who wear the adornment can use Animal Ken in place of Athletics, transforming one’s affinity for cats into physical manifestation, moving a bit more like a cat than a human. With ST approval, this can also apply to an Expression roll while dancing. ''This does not apply to magic power invocations, nor for any xp purchase prerequisites''. %0a%0aTo use the cat’s eye, the wearer simply has to openly display the gemstone on their person - if the gem is covered (such as by clothing) or removed from the setting, the token cannot be used or, if active, ceases to function. The gemstone must be worn as part of a jewelry piece, and can be transferred to new settings and trinkets without ruining its magic. %0a%0aThere is a small ritual involved to activate the gemstone, primarily taking a bit of time to put it on, making sure it lays right, and then brushing a hand over the stone itself last (taking at least two Instant Actions, making it nonviable during combat). The token remains active as long as the ornament is worn (for purposes of Clash of Wills, this counts as a year). Once removed, it must be activated again through the accompanying ritual.%0a%0a:Action: Instant%0a%0a:Mein: When active, the Eye actually blinks and looks around, the chatoyancy shifting as it observes the surroundings. The iris gains depth and appears alive, the pupil expands and contracts with lighting, though no sclera is present.%0a%0a:Drawback: Using human tools suffers an untrained penalty to use (-1 if using a physical or social skill, -3 if using a mental skill). In short, the effect of the cat’s eye makes it more difficult to use objects primarily intended for humans; objects or equipment that can apply to animals can be used without penalty. %0a%0a:Catch: The wearer can activate the token without a roll or glamour by simply walking around on all fours. However, the human body is not built to act on all fours, leading to developing pained muscles. Each use inflicts a cumulative -2 penalty to any action after use, as if a wound penalty. This cannot be offset by any merit or ability. The penalty is reduced by 1 per night’s rest.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Elemental Bow (••••)''%0a%0a:Public/Private: Public%0a%0aThe Elemental Bow is a large, ornate looking bow that’s often carried without any apparent ammunition, unless of course one plans to use it among mundane audiences. Upon activation, the bow alights in a chosen element (fire, ice, electricity, or shadow). Upon the string being drawn back, will form an arrow of that element to be fired. For the rest of the scene, it will deal damage appropriate to the bow’s base stats (chosen from mundane options), but will additionally having effects that the chosen element might have. For example, fire arrows may cause flammable materials to catch on fire.%0a%0aIn addition, when active, the user may reflexively reactivate the object to change the element, rather than needing a standard action to do so, allowing for them to swap easily between the chosen elements in the thick of things.%0a%0a:Action: Standard, reflexive if already active.%0a%0a:Mein: This large looking black bow doesn’t appear to be a real bow for combat, it’s long thin black piece has a thin line for the string. It has an opening in the middle where the arrows are presumably shot from. %0a%0a:Drawback:For 24 hours the user opens themselves to the element; they take 1 extra level of damage from any manifestation of the chosen element, and a -1 penalty to hindrances caused by it.%0a%0a:Catch: The bow explodes with power, causing its wielder damage. The user rolls the weapon rating and takes the successes as lethal damage, at a minimum of 1 lethal. In addition, the user takes an environmental tilt for the scene corresponding to the element activated. The damage does not stack with a ‘re-activation’, but the user WILL suffer multiple tilts, in that case.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Blade of All-Banes (•••••)'' %0a%0aTo every power, there is a loophole, an exploit, and a killswitch. This very premise and power permeates all faerie magic, all magic of any sort really, and this is deeply expressed within the makeup of this baneful blade. Long, curved, and made of darkened steel, this horrid artifact is built with that killswitch and exploit, an expression of and promise with Banes to all those willing to pay its dear price for power. The power to end the life of any supernatural creature. %0a%0a:Action: To activate the blades power, in addition to its price the wielder must call upon it with a brief incantation. %0a%0aWhen active, the Blade of All-Banes enchants itself, dealing aggravated damage to supernatural creatures of any sort (but this will not ignore durability/armor, even on something worn by a supernatural being). Wounds it causes dissolve the supernatural utterly, consuming and unmaking in black fire.  Without activation the sword is a generic, though artfully crafted sword (2L). %0a%0a:Mien: To faerie eyes the baneful blade is black as pitch and blacker, absorbing the light around it and making shadows longer in its presence. It is artfully made by whatever cruel hand made it, with a silver guard and ruby at its end, wrapped in a scaley hide in its handle. %0a%0a:Drawback: When activated by the wyrd or glamour this token also draws upon it the vital essence of its fae wielder. Indeed, a portion of their damaged soul is trapped within it for a time, rendering them Reticent for a number of days equal to their wyrd (minimum 1)%0a%0a:Catch: When wielded by someone not of the fae (or activated without Glamour/Wyrd), its power to devour souls is far greater and more terrible, and its wielders spirit is near fully devoured. The user gains the Soulless condition until or unless their soul is transferred back to them through mystical means from the mystical blade.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''The Jurogumo’s Pipe (•••••)''%0a%0aThe Jurogumo’s Pipe takes the form of a finely made Japanese style kiseru, a long and thin tobacco smoking pipe the length of a human forearm. This kiseru belongs to Vrys’s True Fae Keeper, The Jorogumo, Entangling Mistress of Black Waters. The Pipe is one of many others which have been carelessly lost among the Thorns of the Hedge on from the Mistress’ jaunts out of her Realm. This Token has a small bowl for burning finely shredded tobbacco and a long shaft to a mouthpiece for inhalation with bulging tips at either end.%0a%0aWhen their own human hair is fired in the bowl, the person inhaling the smoke shares an indirect kiss with the Mistress and finds themselves transformed temproarily into an imitation of her image for a scene. They gain +2 Size, 2/2 Armor, and +3 Lethal to their Unarmed attacks as their lower bodies morph into a scuttling arachnid nightmare.%0a%0a:Action: Instant%0a%0a:Mien: The Pipe made from the chitin of spiders and the bone of drowned men fired in hot coals under a new moon’s light. When smoked, the soft caress of the Mistress’ fingers can be felt and her breath in%0a%0a:Drawback: The transformation wreaks havok upon the sense of Self and constitutes a Breaking Point whenever used as both beastly mind and human reason clash together. Additionally, the user takes on Condition: Obsession in the same vein of the licentious Jorogumo and shall suffer one aggravated damage at dawn per night that they do not seduce a stranger into an intimate moment. This may range from a stolen kiss to intercourse, but the token user must seduce a number of different individuals equal to their Wyrd to lift the compulsion. %0a%0a:Catch: If the token user opts not to pay the glamour for activating, the Jurogumo sends a few emissaries of her own to extract her price. The user finds themselves accosted by illusory spiders wherever they go from dawn to dusk, hallucinating visions of black water and entangling webs of hair and silk dragging them beneath. These hallucinations can inflict lethal damage upon the user who must evade them without rest or until suffering their Wyrd in lethal damage from asphyxiating in water.%0a%0a[[#to3]]%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25mage%25'''Mage'''%25%25%0a[[#from4]]%0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25mage%25'''Transmitted Knowledge (Any Arcanum ••)'''%0a:Practice: Ruling%0a:Primary Factor: Per base spell%0a:Suggested Rote Skills: Per base spell%0aBy taking command over the knowledge or information revealed by the Arcana, the Mage is capable of granting this information or enhancement of the senses directly to another. This spell is technically many different spells, but they all work the same way. Any Knowing or Unveiling spell that, by default, only transmits its knowledge or sensory information to the caster can be used as the basis for this spell, which allows another subject (or subjects) to instead be the recipient (though with increased Scale the Mage may still receive it too). In the case of spells that normally require Scale for the subjects being studied, Scale must cover both those granted the knowledge/senses and those targeted by them.\\%0aReach may be spent according to the base spell. In the case of the senses, imagery, or information normally being chosen or manipulated in real time by the Mage, the Mage leaves control of it to the Subject, if they know what they're experiencing. %0a%0a'''+2 Reach:''' The Mage may, by concentrating, experience the increased senses or knowledge of any Subject receiving it, though they lose access to their own senses in the process, even if not included in the Scale. They may also fully control any manipulation of the imagery or knowledge sought (such as deciding to fast forward/reverse Postcognition imagery, for instance).%0a%0a'''Example 1:''' ''A Mage casts Transmitted Knowledge (Divination) on an individual who wishes to see the portents of the future. The spell is cast with 3 potency, and no reach is spent, so the subject is able to ask 3 yes/no questions that they choose. If the Mage had spent the reach for more detailed answers, the subject would be the one receiving them. If, however, he spent the +2 reach to control and experience the subject's information gathering, the Mage would ask the questions and the subject merely experiences the answers along with him.'' %0a%0a'''Example 2:''' ''A Mage casts Transmitted Knowledge (Mental Scan) on someone who wants to dig through the thoughts of the person they're talking to. The Mage takes a -2 penalty, as they need to cover both the subject receiving information, and the one who's thoughts are being read. Without spending the reach on control, the initial subject gets to ask Potency (-Withstand) questions about the target. If the Mage had spent the Reach, he'd control what questions were asked, and experience the answers too. ''%0a%0a'''Example 3:''' ''A Mage casts Transmitted Knowledge (Nightvision) on someone so they can see in the dark. With or without the Reach spent, the senses offered are the same, but with Reach spent the Mage could see what the Subject is experiencing with these senses.

This essentially allows the Mage to see in any amount of darkness, though if no light at all is available, he’ll only see in varying shades of textureless blackness. By default this spell only reveals mundane darkness to the user’s senses.%0a%0a*'''+1 Reach''': The sense extends to the supernatural; anything supernaturally concealed that’s covered with shadows or darkness can still be perceived by the Mage if he wins the ensuing Clash of Wills. This will also outline ‘sentient’ creatures of darkness as separate from other shadows, including mages using Shadow Flesh, or creatures from various shadowy realms….%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Spectral Synthesis (Death ••)''%0a %0a:Practice: Ruling%0a%0a:Primary Factor: Duration%0a%0a:Suggested Rote Skills: Crafts, Weaponry, Firearms%0a%0aUsing this spell the mage fills the microscopic spaces between the molecules, in the target, some form of materal non living object with ephermal residue from the deadlands.

It makes the target dead or undead creature act as if its body was still alive. It does not however remove any weaknesses of the body, such as sunlight vulnerability Etc.  The spell will only give the trappings of being alive. The subject will breath, have warm skin, a pulse, and be able to emulate the other basic functions of life, such as eating and drinking food. Corpses will not stink, bloat or otherwise decompose, and appear to be asleep. The subject will register as alive to most mundane senses and objects, and use of supernatural powers to determine the status will cause a Clash of Wills. It will NOT prevent any of the other normal functions, requirements, or weaknesses of the subject. A vampire may eat, but gains no sustenance from the food, and does not heal like a living person. They are still vulnerable to sunlight, and require vitae to function. Conversely, they do not NEED to breath, eat, etc., still being immune to suffocation, starvation (from deprivation from normal food or drink), and still retain their resistance to injury and other factors.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Invite the Grave (Death •••)''%0a%0a:Practice: Perfecting%0a%0a:Primary Factor: Potency%0a%0a:Withstand: Stamina%0a%0a:Suggested Rote Skills: Medicine, Science, Intimidation%0a%0aThis spell enhances the course of Entropy, making those that suffer from it feel the effects that much more intensely.

For the duration, 2 points of pre-existing bashing damage per point of Potency can be ignored by the subject, as if they were undamaged. The underlying wound will heal at about twice the normal speed during this time, as well, since the body needn’t deal with the actual ‘harm’ itself.

Indeed, these are not merely shadows, the shadows used in this spell are forged from death and have a devastating affect of living flesh, and their potent shadow-forged weapons strike not only the flesh of corpses and dead creatures, but affect their very being. The maximum durability, damage rating, and equipment bonus from objects crafted from shadow increases to match the rating in the casters Death Arcana. Additionally, attacks from these weapons deal lethal damage, even to Undead and Ephemeral beings (related to the Death aspect of Twilight) that normally downgrade such damage.%0a%0a*'''+1 Reach:''' The shadows are potent manifestations of the decay of death, and successful attacks inflict the Sick (Grave) tilt while in combat on living targets. %0a*'''+2 Reach and 1 Mana:''' The weapon does Aggravated damage as it not only attacks the body, rotting away flesh and decaying bone, but it damages the very essence of the creature as well.

Each level of potency causes 2 pre-existing lethal damage (i.e that were there upon casting) to be ignored by the subject, as if not present at all, although the superficial wounds remain, and become dangerous again after the duration ends. However, the underlying injury heals at twice the speed for the duration, as there’s no true harm for the body to struggle against. This will also prevent bleeding out and other injuries that worsen over time for the duration.%0a%0a*'''+1 Reach:''' The spell can suppress pre-existing aggravated damage. %0a*'''+1 Reach:''' The subject may dedicate a Potency to ignore a single pre-existing physical tilt for the duration, rendering any injury or impedance entirely superficial, barring actual removal of an appendage or other body part. %0a*'''+2 Reach''': The effect is Lasting (but the superficial wounds still take time to heal). %0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25mage%25'''Fate Spells'''%25%25%0a%0a----%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Between the Lines (Fate •/Prime •)''%0a%0a:Practice: Knowing%0a%0a:Primary Factor: Duration%0a%0a:Suggested Rote Skills: Academics, Occult, Expression%0a%0aThis spell reveals key information about the form and intent of symbols, whether these are cultural (e.g. art, status items), lingual (e.g. hobo-signs, alien glyphs), or magical (wards, curses, etc.) As examples, the subject may interpret a painting as reflective of melancholy over social issues, a ring or scar as denoting accomplishment or status in a public or secret society, a series of hobo-signs marking a dangerous passage, or arcane symbols as denoting intent to warn, curse, harm, disease, seal, or summon.%0a%0aThe spell offers no information about the creator, the symbol’s origins, or the symbol/item’s veracity (e.g. if a piece is fake or truly gilded). Furthermore, the spell offers no information about follow-through: threatening symbols are no guarantee of violence, nor is a sealing symbol proof of supernatural power and/or its success — only its intent to seal.

She feels the gravity of their narrative as it tries to draw the Mage in to their tropes. Most mages specify certain types of characters to detect, such as “Hobs and Goblin Fruit,” or “only Huntsmen.”%0a%0aAfter successfully casting this spell, the mage can detect all the specified types of characters within the spell’s area Scale, or that enter the spell’s area while it remains in effect.

This spell makes aiming a thrown or fired weapon take less time. In lieu of spending a turn aiming, the aim action’s use-time is reduced to an Instant Action. In most cases, this allows a Mage to aim and move. Also, as long as the Mage does not change the target(s) of this accuracy, attacks do not reset the bonus received from aiming. If the target of the aim action moves outside of the Mage’s line of sight, the aim is disrupted normally. Sleeper Witnesses suffer Quiescence normally.%0a%0a*'''+1 Reach:''' The spells affected aim actions are made reflexively, though this does not allow for multiple aim actions to be taken in one turn.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Channel Glamour (Fate ••)''%0a%0a:Practice: Ruling%0a%0a:Primary Factor: Potency%0a%0a:Suggested Rote Skills: Occult, Expression, Empathy%0a%0aSome of the denizens of the Hedge can be easily bought or distracted, oftentimes drawing the line between friend and foe thinly and without consideration beyond the first few seconds of encountering them. This spell allows a mage to draw Glamour into her Pattern whenever she can manage to uncover some of the recondite energy, be it bargaining with one of the Lost (given willingly), one of their own sorts of charms or receptacles, or stranger things yet still. The mage may transfer an amount of Glamour equal to Potency. However, she cannot channel more Glamour per turn than her Gnosis-derived mana per-turn rate. Glamour stored within the mage's Pattern remains even after the spell's duration expires; however, she can only hold a number of mana and Glamour equal to her Gnosis derived maximum mana.%0a%0a*'''+1 Reach:''' The mage may siphon Glamour directly from a fae creature, though the spell gains Withstand equal to the subject's Composure.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Foreshadow (Fate &#9679;&#9679;)''%0a%0a:Practice: Ruling%0a%0a:Primary Factor: Potency%0a%0a:Suggested Rote Skills: Academics, Expression, Subterfuge%0a%0aWhen a mage casts this spell, he chooses a destiny (or Destiny) of which he is aware. The spell causes the strings of fate to manifest one symbol per dot of Potency of that destiny between the time of casting and when the fated event occurs. For instance, if a Sleeper is destined to get into a car crash, the spell might cause her to see a commercial about auto insurance, or she might drive by the site of a car crash the day before. The effects of this spell are normally minor and subtle, but they can be useful for getting someone to believe in the power of fate and symbolism. Alternatively, the mage might wish to cause foreshadowing to manifest for particularly obscure destinies in order to analyze a mystery from a different point of view.%0a%0a'''+1 Reach:''' The mage chooses how the foreshadowing manifests.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Summoning (Fate ••)''%0a%0a:Practice: Ruling%0a%0a:Primary Factor: Duration%0a%0a:Withstand: Resolve%0a%0a:Suggested Rote Skills: Investigation, Expression and Persuasion%0a%0aFated things and people are pulled together as if by gravity and with this spell the mage compels that law of Fate summoning to her side lost things and people. The mage cast this spell on her target then at anytime during it’s duration she may sense how to reach her target. She doesn’t know the whole route to take just what steps to take to find them but she does have a general sense in what direction her target lies. She may invoke this ability a number of times equal to the spells Potency.%0a%0aIf the Object or Person is within the immediate area the target becomes apparent in someway to the caster, perhaps a soft wind blows making it rattle or a streetlight turns on highlighting it. If the optional Reach effect is taken instead the person or object makes it’s way back to the mage. Typically this takes up to 24 hours if the target is in the same city but could take longer for longer distances.%0a%0aPeople that are being summoned have the impression their being called by the caster and have a rough idea how to find the caster but nothing concrete. Events will conspire to lead and harass the target to come to the caster of this spell.

Hands slip free, keys are dropped and bounce just barely into reach, the cuffs failed to lock tight enough, or the chair the mage is tied to finally decides to break after it’s years of service are through, leaving the subject surrounded with a means to cut her loosened bonds. Efforts to grapple the subject of the spell are reduced to a chance die, regardless of how easily achieved the grapple was established, though the subject suffers similar effects regarding her ability to ensnare subjects as well. Mundane binding of any form, on their own, fail automatically, and Supernatural effects that employ physical means of trapping the subject provoke a Clash of Wills (up to Potency times). This spell fails if the subject is unconscious or otherwise unable to take action%0a%0a*'''Add Time 4''': One such escape attempt’s affected dice roll each turn during the spells Duration can be made as a reflexive action, as the mage applies this strain of defiance over time in the blink of an eye. %0a*'''+1 Reach:''' The effect only works one way, the subject(s) of the magic being able to bind and tie their own targets are unrestricted by the magic, but the target’s own rolls are not penalized to resist these attempts (such as when doing any maneuver other than Breaking Free in a grapple).%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Make It Look Easy (Fate •••)''%0a%0a:Practice: Ruling%0a%0a:Primary Factor: Potency%0a%0a:Withstand: Composure%0a%0aThe subjects exceptional success threshold for mundane rolls are expanded or reduced by the spell’s Potency during the spell’s Duration (to a minimum of 1), up to a number of times equal to Potency. This spell has no control over whether or not success is actually achieved, what it does is increase or decrease the forceful effects of success, so that even meager efforts can make for a higher grade of results, or mighty efforts met with modest effects.

By finessing a wider web of sources, the mage massages Fate in such a way that no lasting harm is done. The subject specified by the mage may not be the first available, but the greater control of Fate ensures that it's there just as quickly, and with less negative ripples in the fabric of destiny. Objects and currencies drawn by the spell don't cause the previous owner or the mage any inherent or lasting trouble. Retainers injured in temporary service end up receiving sufficient medical care somewhere down the line. Favours garnered by Mentor, Allies, or Contacts slip under the radar or already fit into existing plans. Acquired Resources are the result of benevolence, chance, or the vicissitudes of global and personal finances. The effects of the spell are cosmically unnoticed, uncared for, or of little to no actual consequence, thus causing no bad karma (if such a thing exists.)%0a%0aTo prevent itself from tangling the tapestry enough to cause harm, the spell automatically fails if the mage successfully uses this spell more times in a month than half their Fate rating (rounded up) to acquire Merits above 3.%0a%0a*'''+1 Reach:''' The mage finds their subject or goal within one hour.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''What If Scenario (Fate ••••/Time •)''%0a%0a:Practice: Patterning%0a%0a:Primary Factor: Duration%0a%0a:Suggested Rote Skills: Occult; Science, Academics%0a%0aThe mage can look into a subject’s possible future and see what could be if certain strings of fate were manipulated. This allows the mage to divine where altering the fabric of fate may affect the future, or potentially seeing what the outcome of a particular destiny may be. Without reach, the mage can only dvine the effects of their own fate and changes they might make. This spell can see far into the future, allowing the mage to see most likely long-term consequences of their current fate. The mage may incorporate as many possible shifts to their fate as potency. Looking too far from the present increases the likelihood of the answer being superseded by the point the future becomes the present. The Storyteller must decide what the future holds, taking into account the nature of the story as well as cues from the mage’s description of the “what if scenario.”%0a%0aWhile viewing the possible future, the mage loses all Defense and may not take any actions or cast further spells. %0a%0a*'''+1 Reach:''' The mage can specify fates external to their own in the What If Scenario. %0a*'''+1 Reach:''' The mage can specify a specific date and time in the future to perceive the results of the What If scenario at that time.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Exalted One (Fate 5)''  %0a%0a:Practice: Making  %0a%0a:Primary Factor: Potency%0a:Withstand: Composure (if resisted)%0a:Suggested Rote Skills: (Expression, Survival, Streetwise)%0a%0aThis spell is not discussed frequently, even amongst Masters of Fate.

The effects of this vary by subject and circumstance. For example, most liquids and vapours condense/freeze, and most solid substances become brittle (ignore 1 Durability while frozen). If used on a living being, the spell causes Bashing damage equal to Potency for those incapable; if the spell is cast with sufficient Duration on a being capable of hibernation, it may be induced with this spell instead of damage.%0a%0aNote that this spell may cause further effects based on the being frozen, or being subjected to local temperature differences when the spell ends: sudden freezing may cause containers to burst, heated ice may crack, and condensed/frozen vapors may evaporate in high concentrations.%0a%0a*'''+1 Reach:''' The sudden chill is enough to cause Bashing damage to all subjects.

Apply the spell’s Potency to the force’s Strength or Dexterity, and default the other to 1. Use these Attributes with the subject's other stats for rolls. Unused objects float and follow within arm's reach of the character as if held at arm's length. Note that this does not allow the character to perform extra actions: using an item with this spell is still its usual action type.

Grasping deep within this network fueled by the genius of Tesla and Edison, born of Babbage and Turing, the mage may grasp and seize the children of Lovelace, forming them into new shapes to suit an immediate need. The Imago takes this need and realigns the 1s and 0s until they form the function that is required in that instant. What is a program: The chat bot, the firewall, the personal assistant.

Each piece of software can only serve a single function, whether it be searching the internet, driving a car, or targeting an orbital strike.%0a%0aTo code the software to the appropriate form, the mage must have an understanding of the code to be created, requiring a successful Intelligence + Computer check, penalized by the complexity of the new software.

This spell acts as a shield against direct damage from fire and electricity, granting effective armour equal to the caster’s Forces Arcanum. It cannot stack with other sources of magical shields or armour. Mage Armour explicitly suppresses this spell when active, even if the protection should be less than the effect it replaces. Magical sources of harm trigger a Clash of Wills, and the spell can Clash as many times as the spell’s Potency. %0a%0a*'''+1 Reach:''' Instead of the energy being harmlessly scattered, any damage prevented by the spell can be redirected to adjacent targets.

The subject knows how to move to dissipate and redirect the energy from physical blows to reduce damage - possibly even avoiding what would otherwise be a solid strike, potentially setting up a counter-attack. This spell grants the subject’s attempt to dodge physical attacks, including attempts to grapple, the rote quality.

The subject gains the quality for a number of appropriate mundane rolls equal to Potency.

Any spell which is intended to affect a target other than the user of the medium is automatically a touch spell, or must be used as an Aimed Spell, the physical medium thrown, squirted or sprayed at the target with a Dex+Athletics roll, who gets their defense and may attempt to Dodge. %0a%0aIf the stored spell has an area effect, it may be targeted at a location and effect anything within its range. The caster must define the method of use of the medium at the time of casting, if it is swallowed, rubbed or sprayed on, thrown at a target,crushed underfoot, etc. Regardless of the method, it requires an instant action, and the medium is destroyed in the process. Anyone who performs the activation, even accidentally, will trigger the stored spell. %0a%0aIf the duration of the Elixir/Charm spell ends before the stored spell is triggered, the stored spell is lost without effect, but the medium is still destroyed.

This becomes the physical form of the Elixer or Charm. This Sacrament must have an availability rating equal to or higher than the level of the spell the mage wishes to store in the item (if he wants to store a Forces 2 spell, the Sacrament must be Availability 2+). The mage may acquire this material at the normal Availability, or make it himself with the Build Mystic Equipment action (Wits+Occult), using the availability as the penalty to the roll. %0a%0aIf that roll is successful, the total cost of components is reduced by 2, to a minimum of 0. (The mage wants a potion capable of storing a Life 3 effect. If he wants to acquire the needed item normally, it will have an Availability of 3. If he wants to make the potion from scratch, it would require a roll of Wits+Occult-3,and if successful, components with Availability 1). In addition, the Potency of the stored spell can’t exceed the the Potency of the Elixer/Charm spell itself (if the Elixer/Charm is cast with Potency 2, the maximum Potency of any spell stored in it is also 2).%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Extraction (Matter •••)''%0a%0a:Practice: Weaving%0a%0a:Primary Factor: Potency%0a%0a:Withstand: Durability%0a%0a:Suggested Rote Skills: Crafts, Medicine, Science%0a%0aThe mage can separate any non-living material from another, causing it to sublimate, evaporate, or film as it separates.%0a%0aThis does not breakdown existing chemical compounds, but may separate free ions in a substrate such as NA from NaCl dissolved within water, but won’t actively break molecules without additional application of other separate factors such as solvent, electricity, electromagnetic energy, enzymes, acids, bases or heat.

Also, without such a body, an astral traveler is invisible to those in the physical world, even to those who can sense spirits or magic (Spirit 1, Prime 1).

Any usage as a tool is considered to be improvised, and each action doing so expends 1 Mana from the tass. In addition, the tass has no explicit energy, nor it is subject to normal laws regarding its form.

The spell cast is held suspended for the duration of the charged item at its moment of casting within the vessel, like a bullet chambered, until triggered by the proper command. If Charged Item expires before the spell is discharged, the stored spell is lost. %0a%0a*'''+1 Reach''': Creates a physical vessel for the spell with a durability of one, this requires 1 additional mana.%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Witchlight (Prime •••)''%0a%0a:Practice: Weaving%0a%0a:Primary Factor: Potency%0a%0a:Suggested Rote Skills: Expression, Occult, Science%0a%0aThe mage manifests a mote of the Aether’s raw revelatory energies, making light that is visible only to Active Mage Sight. It often appears as an orb of fire or electricity, but may look like anything unliving between the size of a walnut and a torch. Witchlights have substance, but are of negligible weight, able to be scooped up by hand. It provides no heat or force, and does not evoke special responses by appearance (e.g. frenzy or bans from fire); however, the appearance may still be shocking, or provoke responses related to light if it can be perceived. It may be held, positioned on a subject, or launched as an aimed spell like a flare. If a target wishes to resist a witchlight’s attachment to their Pattern, use Composure as a Withstand to make it simply slide off and continue with its natural momentum.%0a%0aA witchlight illuminates 10 yards per point of Potency clearly enough to make rolls without penalties for darkness, and twice that range at half the darkness penalty (rounded down). The light may be willfully dimmed, enhanced, or strobed to inflict the Poor Lighting Condition within its range of clear illumination.%0a%0a*'''+1 Reach''': Increase the witchlight to the size of a bonfire, doubling its range of illumination.%0a*'''+1 Reach''': The light may be made visible to all supernatural entities, or even revealed fully into the Fallen world.%0a*'''+2 Reach and 1 Mana''': The witchlight is Lasting, but cannot be fixed to a living target, burst, or change its level of illumination.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Burden of Power (Prime ••••)''%0a%0a:Practice: Patterning%0a%0a:Primary Factor: Duration%0a%0a:Withstand: Resolve%0a%0a:Suggested Rote Skills: Occult, Athletics, Persuasion%0a%0aHeavy is the burden of magic but heavier still, some would say, is the active weight of it upon its caster’s pattern.

It inflicts the Insensate Tilt for the Duration of the spell, or until the Tilt is resolved (for instance, by being attacked beyond this spell’s effects).%0a%0a*'''+1 Reach''': The subject receives a Supernal vision that offers great insight.

By empowering one's Immediate Nimbus, the mage may imbue it with an addictive quality. Those who experience it seek to experience it again, rolling Resolve + Composure when next in the presence of the mage. Failure causes the subject to gain the deprived state. While in this condition, the mage gains a bonus to social maneuvering equal to the potency of the spell against the deprived individual.%0a%0a*'''Reach +1''': The mage places the subjects immediately into the deprived condition.%0a*'''Reach +1''': The effect may be stored in an instance of the mage's signature nimbus, triggering the effect on any that scrutinize it. This causes the individual to form an addiction to the subject upon which the signature nimbus is placed. Should the signature nimbus fade before the spell's duration expires, any who experienced the trap gain the deprived condition until they encounter the nimbus again.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Imbued With Power (Prime ••••)''%0a%0a:Practice: Patterning%0a%0a:Primary Factor: Duration%0a%0a:Withstand: Resolve%0a*if resisted%0a%0a:Cost: 1 Mana%0a%0a:Suggested Rote Skills: Occult, Animal Ken or Subterfuge%0a%0aThe spell allows a mage to imbued a Sleepwalker or another Mage with a small gift of their power. The mage casts the spell and ties it to the target’s pattern. The spell is only half formed allowing for some flexibility to the recipient to use.%0a%0aThe target may cast the spell at anytime the caster could and makes all the decisions for the spell. The target can spend reach and uses the dice pool of the caster. However any mana that the spell needs or might use must be spent when Imbue With Power is cast unless the target has their own Mana to spend (The mage may place Mana with the Imbued With Power spell). It should be noted that the recipient cannot use Yantra’s with this spell or benefit from Ritual casting (although they still can to avoid spending Reach to make the spell Instant.)%0aImbue With Power has a drawback. Paradox is suffered by both the caster and target of the mage of any spell unleashed by Imbued With Power. While Paradox can be dealt with normally if the recipient is a Sleepwalker without Wisdom they cannot internalize it.%0a%0aThe gifted spell can be used a number of times equal to this spell’s potency. The target of this spell cannot gain more potency of their gifted spell than Imbue With Power’s potency.%0a%0a*'''+X Reach and 1 Mana''':  When casting Imbued With Power the mage may also include an Attainment that can be included with the spell. X is equal to the Attainment’s required Arcana level. This may only be an attainment that enhances or alters the spell directly; Temporal Sympathy could be added, for instance, but not Mage Armor.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Lamina (Prime ••••)''%0a%0a:Practice: Patterning%0a%0a:Primary Factor: Potency%0a%0a:Withstand: Stamina%0a%0a:Cost: 1 Mana per subject%0a%0a:Suggested Rote Skills: Expression, Crafts, Occult%0a%0aThe mage exudes and crystallizes a pelt of mana over the subject’s flesh, fusing a protective layer of tass to the mana that constitutes the subject’s pattern. Each level of Potency may be directed to 1 point of general or ballistic armor. Naturally, the subject glows like a lamp to anyone capable of sensing mana, and is unlikely to be able to explain their appearance to Sleepers.%0a%0a*'''+1 Reach''': Mana may be invested into the lamina to make it immune to the Armor Piercing effect for a turn. This may be invested during casting and held until use, or spent directly by the subject. Unused Mana is not destroyed when the spell ends, but sublimates into the world and likely returns to the nearest Hallow.%0a*'''+1 Reach, add Matter &#149;••''': The lamina becomes immune to the Armor Piercing effect.%0a*'''+1 Reach, add Forces or Matter ••(+)''': Features of the lamina (e.g. horns, spikes, fangs, etc.) act like natural weapons, with a lethal damage bonus equal to half the added Forces or Matter rating (choose only one), rounded up.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Manipulate Pattern (Prime ••••)''%0a%0a:Practice: Unravelling%0a%0a:Primary Factor: Potency%0a%0a:Withstand: Stamina%0a%0a:Suggested Rote Skills: Medicine, Larceny, Empathy%0a%0aSacrifice is the most potent of magics. A mage may burn through his own life to replenish his magical reserves. Control of the Aetheric Wind allows them to go beyond the limits of their own pattern, reaching further and using those currents not as a blunt instructment but a precise tool with which they can begin to deconstruct the world into its most raw compontent part: Mana. Scouring or Restoring a pattern is the most basic practice a mage can perform, it is an essential quality to the awakened soul. This spell may restore a target’s pattern with mana or damage a pattern for mana using the normal conversion rates. Mages who possess Life’s Second Attainment: Improved Pattern Restoration may choose whether they wish to apply its effects to another living person when the spell is cast.%0a%0a*'''Reach +1''': An inanimate object (worth at least Availability 2) may be scoured or repaired. Most possess only a single point of mana but rare or priceless objects may contain more. Repairing requires a point of mana per point of structure.

A mixture of Patterning between Prime and Fate apply Supernal perfection to the subject’s High Speech, imbuing succinct words of power with the same symbolic value, intent, and determination as longer and/or repetitive mantras. As long as the subject may speak, High Speech may be used as a secondary reflexive yantra (MtA 119).%0a%0a*'''+1 Reach''': This extension of raw intent applies the subject’s unbridled articulations of magical symbolism to their High Speech. The yantra die bonus of using High Speech mantras (MtA 119) is substituted by the subject’s unaltered Occult rating (to a maximum of +5), even if this causes the character to receive a lower die bonus, or none at all. If used in this manner, High Speech may still be used as a reflexive Yantra, but loses its “secondary” quality (and thus cannot go over turn limits on yantra).%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Sanctuary (Prime ••••)''%0a%0a:Practice: Patterning%0a%0a:Cost: 1 Mana%0a%0a:Primary Factor: Duration%0a%0a:Withstand: Resolve %0a*If Resisted%0a%0a:Suggested Rote Skills: Academics,Occult, Empathy%0a%0aFor its duration, the caster may choose to grant the subject(s) of Sanctuary the effects of any Mage Armor the caster currently has in effect, at the appropriate level of effect. If the caster changes his Mage Armor, this change also effects the subjects of the Sanctuary. %0a%0a:IE: The mage casts Sanctuary, using the Scale Factor to effect two targets. He then raises his Matter 3 Mage Armor for one mana. This would also grant both of the subjects of this spell 3 General Armor which ignores Armor Piercing. If the mage then spent a mana (and a reflexive action) to change to Life 3 Mage Armor, both subjects would lose the 3 General Armor (and the hardening against Armor Piercing), but gain 2 General Armor, and +2 Defense using the higher of (their OWN) wits or dexterity. %0a%0aIf the subject of this spell is unwilling, he may withstand with Resolve, and if the subject is another mage, they may choose, at any time, to use their own Mage Armor instead of that granted by Sanctuary, at the normal cost to change Mage Armor (1 Mana and a Reflexive Action).%0a%0a*'''+1 Reach''': The subjects and the caster of the Sanctuary may share the protection of any Mage Armor raised by any subject. %0a%0a:IE: The mage cast Sanctuary on another Awakened. That mage has Time 4 Mage Armor in effect. The caster, and any other subjects of the Sanctuary spell, add +4 to their Defense, may use their Defense vs firearms, and if they succeed at a Dodge Action, they can reduce the attackers Initiative by 4 for the remainder of the scene by spending a mana (if they have any). If there are multiple mages as the subject of the Sanctuary, with different Mage Armors active, a subject may choose any of the active Mage Armors (or any they themselves possess), to be activated for 1 mana and a reflexive action.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Sanctum Sanctorum (Prime ••••)''%0a%0a:Practice: Perfecting%0a%0a:Primary Factor: Potency%0a%0a:Withstand: Sanctum Rating (if any) Suggested Rote Skills: (Occult, Expression, Academics)\\%0a%0aWith this spell, the caster may sanctify an area, causing it to act as a Sanctum or increasing the rating of an existing Sanctum, or defile an area or existing Sanctum, reducing it’s rating. If the area is currenly not a Sanctum, it becomes one with a rating equal to the spells potency. If it is a existing Sanctum, the rating is either raised or lowered by 1 (to a maximum of 5, or minimum of -5), withstood by the current Sanctum rating (absolute value). If an area has a negative Sanctum rating, it SUBTRACTS its value from Gnosis to determine spell control. %0a%0a*'''+2 Reach''': For 1 Mana, the effect is Lasting%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Squaring the Circle (Prime •••• OR optionally Prime ••• Mind ••••)''%0a%0a:Practice: Patterning%0a%0a:Primary Factor: Duration%0a%0a:Suggested Rote Skills: Brawl, Expression, Occult%0a%0aAn enhanced version of Display of Power, rather than merely providing a visible representation of a spell’s Imago, this rote projects a visible and audible representation of what the results would be if those Imagos were expressed in the Fallen World. This provides a more dynamic display that allows the mages involved to show off their personal styles, as well as makes witnessing the duel more interesting.%0a%0aThe sensory effects provided by this spell are obviously illusory (visuals are translucent and sounds are distant and hollow), and will not fool anyone witnessing them that they are real.%0a%0a*'''+2 Reach''': For one Mana, any attempt to Counterspell (p. 192) a spell cast within the area gains the rote action quality, as the plainly visible Imago makes the spell easy to decipher.

Humans have known this for ages. Fire has power. Iron has power. The instruments of the awakened provide a focus to magic and with the right changes to their supernal resonance, a focus to enchantment. This spell empowers a single yantra per potency to be used during the process of Imbuing an item, providing its bonuses to the Gnosis + Prime pool of the Fourth Prime Attainment: Imbue Item. A mage remains limited in the number of yantras used by their gnosis. %0a%0aTool Instruments must in some way be a part of the item being imbued. A cup, a coin, a staff, or some other Order style object, a material that resonates with the purpose of the spell included is another example. A sympathy included may be used to benefit from that sympathetic connection either as a bonus or as a necessary sympathetic connection in its use. An environmental yantra locks the item to that environment but a church is a church is a church, the symbols are the important part. A shadowname’s persona locks the item to the individual mage and those whose persona share a symbolism. It is common for masters and apprentices to share such symbolism.%0a%0a*'''Reach +1''': Yantras used in the creation of the object are applied as permanent bonuses to its casting total.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Enlightenment (Prime •••••)''%0a%0a:Practice: Making%0a%0a:Primary Factor: Duration%0a%0a:Suggested Rote Skills: Academics, Occult, Expression%0a%0aThe Truth Is in Here.

But these lost souls and some of those who have realized there is more to the world... who are on the cusp of awakening or not yet found the Path... those who still search for it can find that there is a benefit to serving the Awakened.

This is what is known as magic. Calling down this energy as a pure manifestation forces this energy into the mage's immediate nimbus which remains active until a spell is cast or the duration of this effect expires. The spell when cast benefits from the Steadfast condition so long as its remaining dice pool carries a single non-chance die. The potency of the next spell cast may not exceed the potency of this spell. If it does, the spell does not benefit from the automatic success and this effect is consumed with no benefit.

A simulacrum bears a sense of awareness that allows Defense, sensory rolls, and proactive behavior to preserve itself and those under its care. Furthermore, spending Potency on the Retainer Merit offers a single "field," and additional Potency may be spent toward more. Retainer fields and commands may be complex, but can only be physical in nature and rely on deduction and direction, not genuine creativity or social behavior. As examples, a craftsman can build a house according to a plan, but cannot design one; a warrior can shoot a gun and target unarmoured spots, but not devise a battle plan; and a mount or guide can deduce how to travel rough terrain or through passages/structures to reach destinations, but wouldn't know to check for unconventionally hidden passages (e.g. behind waterfalls and bookcases) without command.%0a%0a'''+1 Reach:''' The tass is telepathically linked to the caster, allowing them to reflexively share commands and senses.

Any mundane attempt to link them to their occluded past through physical or circumstantial evidence fails, and supernatural attempts to link the subject to their past provokes a Clash of Wills. This spell has no effect on memories. Without the aid of Temporal Sympathy, only events in the unchanged past may be occluded.%0a%0a*'''+1 Reach''': The subject is can not be tracked as their link to their own footsteps fades.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Five O’Clock Shadow (Time ••)''%0a%0a:Practice: Veiling%0a%0a:Primary Factor: Duration%0a%0a:Suggested Rote Skills: Politics, Survival, Subterfuge%0a%0aThis spell allows a Mage to alter the subject’s apparent age, or to make them rapidly progress or regress through time: someone could be made to appear older or younger; a seed could become a plant, or a plant could become a seed; a plant could be made to bear fruit or wither away as though it were winter; hair and nails could be lengthened and shortened; a kettle could be made to boil or cool. The changes brought on by this spell are illusionary, and some supernatural powers (including Time Mage Sight) may see through them with a successful Clash of Wills.%0a%0a*'''+1 Reach''': This spell may cause the subject to detect as being from another time entirely, or to detect as moving faster or slower through time, or any other number of temporal anomolies with a Clash of Wills.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Fog of Ages (Time ••)''%0a%0a:Practice: Veiling%0a%0a:Primary Factor: Potency%0a%0a:Withstand: Resolve%0a%0a:Suggested Rote Skills: Academics, Larceny, Subterfuge%0a%0aBy means of this spell, an Apprentice of Time can hide the past from the subject. One consecutive Scene per Potency of the spell is obscured, meaning the subject can not remember it or acknowledge the results of it. +1 Reach: The scenes obscured by this spell no longer need to be consecutive.%0a %0a*'''+1 Reach''': Instead of obscuring entire scenes, this spell can obscure specific events within a scene while leaving the rest of the event unchanged.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Procrastination (Time ••)''%0a%0a:Practice: Shielding%0a%0a:Primary Factor: Potency%0a%0a:Suggested Rote Skills: Occult, Socialize, Survival%0a%0aSure the subject might have just been hit by a truck or eaten by a grue, and yes a Disciple of Time has to deal with the fact that actually happened… but… they’ll get around to it later. This spell protects the subject’s pattern from being changed by what is going on in the present. Up to one Condition, Tilt, or instance of Damage may be suspended per point of Potency. When Damage is suspended, you only suspend a number of health levels equal to Potency. Directly supernatural changes require a Clash of Wills to suspend. When this spell’s duration wears off, all suspended events affect the subject instantly.%0a%0a*'''+1 Reach''': Once the spell ends, suspended effects happen at a rate of one per turn.%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Arcadian Hours (Time •••)''%0a%0a:Practice: Fraying%0a%0a:Primary Factor: Potency%0a%0a:Withstand: Target Spell’s Caster’s Arcana Rating%0a%0a:Suggested Rote Skills: Occult, Drive or Persuasion%0a%0aThe mage targets a spell causing it to be expended more quickly. If successful, this spell causes the targeted spell to elapse at a rate of (1 + Potency) times faster until this spell expires. This cannot reduce the duration beyond 1 remaining turn.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Changing the Clock Face (Time •••)''%0a%0a:Practice: Weaving%0a%0a:Primary Factor: Potency%0a%0a:Withstand: Composure%0a%0a:Suggested Rote Skills: Academics, Stealth, Persuasion%0a%0aThis spell allows a mage to cause the subject to rapidly progress or regress through time up to one year per Potency. Unlike Five O’Clock Shadow, these changes are real. However, they produce no mechanical benefit or hindrance, but they may have cosmetic and some narrative impact. For instance, someone made older by this spell would look and feel different, but they would have the same traits and they would live the same length of time after this spell.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Long Day (Time •••)''%0a%0a:Practice: Fraying%0a%0a:Primary Factor: Potency%0a%0a:Withstand: Stamina%0a%0a:Suggested Rote Skills: Academics, Socialize, Survival%0a%0aThis spell makes the subject profoundly feel every moment they’ve been awake, even if they’ve just awoken. They gain the Lethargic Condition as though they have been awake for 1 hour per point of Potency and must make an immediate roll to stay awake. At the ST’s discretion, subjects who don’t feel fatigue may be immune to this spell.%0a%0a*'''+1 Reach''': The subject takes 1 Bashing Damage per point of Potency which can not be healed so long as the subject has the Lethargic condition.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Lost Time (Time •••)''%0a%0a:Practice: Fraying%0a%0a:Primary Factor: Potency%0a%0a:Withstand: Composure%0a%0a:Suggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Academics, Socialize%0a%0aPeople get lost in the moment—they are having fun, or hard at work, and suddenly it’s a few hours later and they are left wondering where the time went? This spell allows the Mage to degrade the subject’s ability to change with the progression of time, inflicting the Insensate Tilt. If they were engaged in a reasonably inane task that requires little important decision making (such as reading, playing a game, watching TV, etc) they will continue to do it.%0a%0a*'''+1 Reach''': The subject becomes unaware of their surroundings for the duration of the spell.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Sequel (Time •••)''%0a%0a:Practice: Weaving%0a%0a:Primary Factor: Potency%0a%0a:Withstand: Resolve%0a%0a:Suggested Rote Skills: Persuasion, Science, Survival%0a%0aWith this spell, a Mage can force someone to relive past trials and victories. The subject gains one mundane, non-persistent Condition or Tilt per dot of the spell’s Potency that they have experienced in the past. The mage can select conditions they know about, or simply seek out conditions that match broad criteria (in which case the subject’s player chooses something appropriate). Without the Temporal Sympathy Attainment, this spell can only cause someone to to be affected by Conditions and Tilts experienced in the Unchanged past.%0a%0a*'''+2 Reach''': You may add a supernatural Condition or Tilt so long as you have another Arcana related to your choice rated at ••• or higher.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Accelerate Metabolism (Time ••••)''%0a%0a:Practice: Perfecting%0a%0a:Primary Factor: Duration%0a%0a:Withstand: Stamina %0a**If Resisted%0a%0a:Suggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Medicine or Science%0a%0aThe spell accelerates the bodies natural healing process. Normally the domain of Shamans this spell still see’s use from desperate mages despite it’s drawbacks. For each potency of the spell the subject’s healing times are halved. The spell however puts enourmous strain on the subject which gains the Drained condition once they’ve been under this spell’s influence for a number of hours greater than the target’s Stamina. The condition is persistent until the spells end. Afterwards it can be cleared by eating enough food and getting some rest.%0a%0a*'''+1 Reach''': The subject’s accelerated metabolism helps them react faster granting +1 Initiative per Potency.%0a*'''+1 Reach''': The mage spends 1 additional Mana and subject(s) does not gain the Drained condition from this spell%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Co-Temperus (Time ••••)''%0a%0a:Mana Cost: 1%0a%0a:Practice: Patterning%0a%0a:Primary Factor: Potency%0a%0a:Suggested Rote Skills: Larceny, Politics, Subterfuge%0a%0aBy making the present as indeterminable as the future, this spell can allow the subject to participate in multiple ‘potential presents’ simultaneously. The subject splits into one additional version of themselves per Potency. This is not a true division of the subject, but instead is the subject existing in multiple timelines. They share a single Willpower and Mana pool, but are otherwise treated as separate. %0a%0aAt the beginning of the subject’s turn, each version of themselves may perform their actions as normal. However, apply the results of only one version of the subject on the world around them, and each version of the subject completely ignores what the others do (sometimes even occupying the same space). For instance, if one version of the subject opens a door and goes through it, all other versions of the subject still have to open the door and walk through it.%0a%0aIf at the end of the turn the subject chooses to apply the changes of another version of themselves who did not open the door on the world, then the door would be closed at the end of the turn (having never been opened). Any supernatural powers that affect one or more versions of the subject affects all of them. When the spell ends or is canceled, only one version of the subject sticks around, and that version suffers all of the damage, conditions and tilts suffered by all other versions of themselves, but also gains all knowledge and experiences from the discarded versions of themselves.%0a%0a*'''Add Mind (••)''': The different versions of the subject may communicate telepathically.%0a*'''+1 Reach''': The different versions of the subject are more insulated from each other. When one or more of them is affected by a supernatural power, then they may roll a Clash of Wills to keep all other versions from themselves from being equally affected.%0a*'''+1 Reach''': The version of the subject that remains after the spell expires gains the worst damage from all versions of themselves, instead of all of it.%0a**'''Note''': A Space •••• equivalent of this spell exists, but relies on a duplication of the character’s spatial presence instead of timelines.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Encore (Time ••••)''%0a%0a:Practice: Patterning%0a%0a:Primary Factor: Potency%0a%0a:Withstand: Composure%0a%0a:Suggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Expression, Science%0a%0aBy means of this spell, the Mage can cause someone to repeat the actions of the past. Without the Temporal Sympathy attainment, the Mage chooses one instant action the subject performed in the unchanged past. The subject performs that same action on their next turn. They perform the same motions and thoughts they did, without regards to their surroundings. This makes interacting with a changing world imprecise (i.e. striking an opponent who has moved would cause them to strike at the same spot).%0a%0a*'''+1 Reach''': Instead of an instant action, the subject will repeat an entire Scene. This reach may be selected multiple times, causing the subject to repeat more than one scene’s worth of actions.%0a*'''+1 Reach''': The subject will adjust their motions to try and produce the same result as their prior actions. Someone who read a book will pick up that same book to read if it is handy. Someone who threw a punch would throw a punch at the same target if they are nearby. If the subject can’t achieve the same result with only minor adjustments, they will mime the action normally.%0a*'''+3 Reach''': As above, but the Mage may select new targets for the subject’s actions. The decision for what replaces the old target is made when the spell is cast, and that decision persists for the duration of the spell.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Hung Action (Time ••••)''%0a%0a:Practice: Patterning%0a%0a:Primary Factor: Duration%0a%0a:Suggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Medicine, Subterfuge%0a%0aOne mundane instant action performed by the subject while this spell is active becomes “hung” in time. Resolve the effects of the action then, but instead of performing that action the subject merely passes their turn. When this spell’s duration ends or it is canceled, the suspended action affects the world. Many mages use the the Fate •• attainment Conditional Duration on Hung Action, so it releases its action under set circumstances.%0a%0a*'''Add Fate (••)''': Instead of suspending an action entirely, the Mage may suspend only their success. The suspended action appears to happen, yet it looks like a failure (or, at the subject’s option, a dramatic failure—this does not grant a beat). When the spell ends, it turns out the action was a success the entire time.%0a*'''+1 Reach''': The subject may hang one additional mundane action while this spell is active. This Reach may be selected multiple times.%0a*'''+2 Reach''': This spell may apply to Extended Actions as well as Instant Actions.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Stopwatch (Time ••••)''%0a%0a:Practice: Unraveling%0a%0a:Primary Potency: Potency%0a%0a:Withstand: Resolve%0a%0a:Cost: 1 Mana%0a%0a:Suggested Rote Skills: Occult, Science, Intimidation%0a%0aThe subject’s journey through time is slowed almost to the point of stopping. They attempt to do something, only to have the actions play out in slow motion as they are witnesses to their own body. To them the world moves with sudden, great speed. The subject’s Speed and Defense are reduced to 0. They declare their action at the beginning of the round, but it only takes place at the end of the round (in the order of the Mage’s choosing in the case of multiple subjects). Everyone else’s action coints as interrupting their action.%0a%0a*'''+1 Reach''': The subject suffers the Immobilized Tilt as the slowing of Time becomes that much more all encompassing.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Weave The Tapestry (Time ••••)''%0a%0a:Practice: Patterning%0a:Primary Factor: Potency%0a:Withstand: Resolve%0a%0aA Mage may use this spell to guide the subject through multiple potential futures, ensuring that they pick what is best (or worst) for them. The Mage may cause the subject to reroll a number of mundane rolls equal to this spell’s potency. The mage chooses which rolls are rerolled, and whether to keep the old roll or use the new one. No dicepool may be rerolled more than once by this effect, even if another effect forces a reroll (in that case, you may perform a Clash of Wills to choose which roll to keep).%0a%0a*'''+2 Reach''': This spell may affect spellcasting rolls and supernatural rolls.%0a%0a[[#to4]]%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Mortal/+'''%25%25%0a%0a[[#from5]]%0a%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Supernatural Merits'''%25%25%0a%0a----%0a%0a!!!%25center%25Second Sight Conversions%0a%0aThe following conversions of Second Sight merits is open for use by characters.

Maybe it’s tiny hairs, or sticky pads, but you have a knack for denying gravity by climbing up seemingly flat walls, and even hanging from ceiling.%0a:Run like a Gazelle: Maybe the length of your arms and legs shift to allow you to run on all fours, or maybe your knees bow backwards like a gazelles, but you have adapted for speed and mighty leaps! When running on all fours, add +4 to her Speed and double all jump distances. Like most Biomimicry additions, these changes are always fairly visible and obvious.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Augmented Dexterity (••-••••)''%0a%0a:Public/Private: Public%0a:Prerequisites: Protocol at equal level%0a%0a:Effect: At 2 dots this grants a +1 Dexterity boost, at 4 dots it grants a +2. This affects all derived traits. This can take your character above her normal Attribute limits.%0a%0a:Deprived: You use your Dexterity for calculating Defense.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Leeching Touch (•-••••)''%0a%0a:Public/Private: Public %0a:Prerequisites: Psychic Vampire, Psychic Vampirism •••%0a%0a:Effect: The hunger of a Psychic Vampire causes many to find non-violent ways to feed, but there come times when a Psy Vamp is forced to act in a more brutish fashion. Some of the older of the Psychic Vampires have come to learn a way to defend themselves more efficiently, turning combat into a feeding frenzy, at the pinnacle of their mastery. This fighting style does not break the limitations of spending or holding ephemera, nor do they allow you to damage creatures that would not originally be effected by the Psychic vampire's abilities. It is strictly effective in hand to hand combat, up to and including combat with a psychic vampire who is under the effects of their own Shapeshifting Skin.%0a%0a*'''Deep (•):''' The Psychic Vampire's knowledge of the flow of Ephemera allows him to coax it out through the skin. Upon successfully striking (whether damage is done or not), Ephemera ruptures from the victim's body, causing a single level of additional damage based upon the Psychic Vampire's mastery (Bashing for levels that do not allow lethal damage to be done, bashing or lethal for those who can pull lethal damage from their feeding)%0a*'''Hungry Aura (••):''' Cost- 1 Ephemera to activate for a number of turns equal to the character's Psychic Vampire rating.%0aEvery inch of skin can be used to feed, and the initiates of the fighting style have learned to capitalize on this, dealing one bashing to anyone who strikes them, adding that single ephemera to their pool (will not increase above their maximum ability to hold ephemera.)%0a*'''Overloaded (•••):''' Upon successfully striking an opponent, the psychic vampire may spend a point of Ephemera to effectively load it into the victim, causing 1 automatic bashing damage per turn that is not affected by armor or defense. This effect lasts a number of turns equal to the character's psychic vampirism level.%0a*'''The Best Offense... (••••):''' The character can opt to use their feeding roll (Intelligence+Occult+Psychic Vampirism) instead of their usual dodge roll. Successes rolled are subtracted from the damage dealt, and half (rounded downed, minimum of 1) are dealt back to the attacker.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Mind Over Body (• or •••) ''%0a%0a:Public/Private: Private%0a%0a:Effect: Sometimes the only way to persevere is sheer willpower.  This merit lets you tap into mental reserves beyond your normal capacity, at a price.  In this case, the price is your very health.  Use a instant action to regain 1 point of will power in exchange for taking one point of resistant lethal damage; no magical abilities can heal or downgrade this damage.  The three dot version allows this to be done as a reflexive action.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Never Tell Me The Odds (•••) ''%0a%0a:Public/Private: Private %0a%0a:Prerequisites: Damned Lucky %0a%0a:Effect: Being lucky doesn't always mean you hit the draw, but you do consistently beat the odds.  This power is how you do it, by essentially doubling the odds in your favor.  That Atariya rolls Wit+Subterfuge, with a success they can reroll a single roll.  Or force/allow another character to reroll a single roll.  If the target is not willing, he can contest the roll with Resolve+Power Stat. The Atariya must live with the results of the reroll, for better or worse. Twisting fate to this degree does not come without a cost.  Activating this power costs 1 Lethal damage that cannot be negated or healed by supernatural means.    %0a%0aThis power can be used Reflexively, but also can be used ahead of time and stored as a "charge".  If unused the "charge" expires at the end of the scene. %0a%0aUpon an exceptional, the Atariya can choose to add or subtract a single success from the result. %0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Ritual Sorcerer (•-•••••)''%0a%0a:Public/Private: Private%0a%0a:Prerequisites: One Mental Attribute at 4, Occult 4%0a%0aFor every dot in this merit, you may choose one non-damage dealing supernatural merit (Omen Sensitivity, Mind of a Mad Man, etc). You may now perform a ritual to utilize the merit without spending Willpower as outlined below. Each roll made = 1 hour. The power goes off when the ritual is completed.  If the number of successes matter for the power - such as determining the number of questions that can be asked - make the correlating activation roll.%0a%0aAdditionally when purchasing the first dot of this merit you may gain a 'mastery' in a particular subject such as making charms or summoning a particular type of spirit. When making rolls related to this subject, gain a +1.

But the beasts of the kindred have an instinctive fondness, a desire to protect you from themselves and maybe sometimes even from others. While you may not serve as a test of their detachment, you do serve as a balance to their frenzy. The beast is less inclined to frenzy in your presence, less willing to risk you, and if they do frenzy more likely to listen to you…….failing any of that you can always count on the fact, that at the very least, the beast will turn on you last…%0a%0aSystem wise, Kindred in your presence gain +2 to resist frenzy and if they fall into frenzy their blood potency is treated as if 2 lower, to a minimum of 1. For the expenditure of a WP a beast in the throes of frenzy, who isn’t already antagonistic you, will instinctively become protective of you.%0a%0a:Drawback: There are few drawbacks as strong as a vampires grief. To wake from the frenzy and find friends, loved ones, torn assunder by the beast, and you still standing. It’s a quick way to draw the punishment of all those delightful stages of grief….in a very cold….dark….and lonely place, for many years or life times. If you have not soothed the beast before their frenzy finds their friends…..it might be best to stop trying and just go with the bloody flow.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Telekinesis, Advanced (•• - •••••)''%0a%0a:Private:%0a%0a:Prerequisite: Telekinesis •••••, Resolve ••••, Occult •••%0a%0a:Effect: Your telekinetic abilities are raising to frightening levels, more and more its own muscle, and destructive. The two-dot version of this merit allows your telekinetic attacks to deal lethal damage. For each additional dot taken, you may also add 1 to your effective merit rating for Telekinesis, allowing it to go above 5. For instance, at 4 dots of this merit your effective Telekinesis (and the strength derived) is 7.%0a%0a:Drawback: Transcending your prior limits like this is changing you. Acquiring this merit is a breaking point.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Unseen Sense, Advanced (•••)''%0a%0a:Prerequisite: Unseen Sense%0a%0a:Effect: Your characters sixth sense for a type of supernatural creature is increased. By spending a point of Willpower she can extend the range of her unseen senses to 100 yards. As with Unseen Sense, the player can accept the Spooked Condition, in exchange for which the character can pinpoint where the feeling is coming from; this reveals all triggers of it within that range. If the target is using a power that specifically cloaks its supernatural nature, however, this does not work (though the Condition remains until resolved as usual), nor does it work against powers that use mental illusions to conceal or otherwise hide the character.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Unseen Sense, Epic (•••)''%0a%0a:Prerequisite: Unseen Sense%0a%0a:Effect: Your characters sixth sense is increased to detect any supernatural creature, and she is able to distinguish between them. As with Unseen Sense, Advanced, the player can accept the Spooked Condition, in exchange for which the character can pinpoint where the feeling is coming from; this reveals all triggers of it within that range. If the target is using a power that specifically cloaks its supernatural nature, however, this does not work (though the Condition remains until resolved as usual), nor does it work against powers that use mental illusions to conceal or otherwise hide the character.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Velocity Drag (••)''%0a%0a:Public/Private: Public%0a%0a:Prerequisites: Telekinetic Evasion%0a%0a:Effect:While using Telekinesis to avoid a fist or a baseball bat is easy, what happens when someone comes at you with a pistol or shotgun? Being mortal means being able to die, but someone with the power of Telekinesis can learn to lessen the impact of ballistics on their body by creating a field of drag around them that bullets must pass through. While this effect has little notice on slow moving objects like melee weapons or brawling fists, high-velocity rounds are restricted in their speed or misdirected to less sensitive areas. Characters with this merit may spend an additional willpower for a scene to treat their dots in Telekinesis as Ballistic Armor, providing the same sort of defense against guns that mundane armor would. This armor protects against Armor Piercing tag as well. This can be applied in any scene where you have telekinesis active. %0a%0a:Drawback: Firearms attacks made from weapons you wield while inside the protective barrier suffer from the same Ballistic armor against your opponents, the drag works both ways.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Wired Reflexes (•• or ••••)''%0a%0a:Public/Private: Private%0a%0a:Prerequisites: Protocol at Matching level%0a%0a:Effect: This augmentation increases the speed at which the Lostboy’s body responds to threats of danger utilizing the users own subconscious reflexes to jerk them out of the way. At two dots, this translates to a +1 Defense, the fourth boosts the Defense by 2 instead.%0a%0a:Deprived: No added bonus to Defense, At 2 dots May add half defense roundup vs Ranged Attacks, at 4 dots Full Defense vs Firearms.%0a%0a[[#to5]]%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25vampire%25'''Vampire and Ghoul'''%25%25%0a%0a----%0a %0a[[#from1]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25vampire%25'''Devotions'''%25%25%0a%0a----%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Arcane Sight (Auspex ••, Coil of Zirnitra •• OR Cruac ••)''%0a%0aBy aligning their Beast’s senses with the workings of magic and mystic energy instead of the secrets and weaknesses of their prey, the Kindred becomes able to study the weave of the supernatural. %0a%0a:Public/Private: Private %0a%0a:Cost: 1 Vitae %0a%0a:Dice Pool: None %0a%0a:Action: Instant %0a%0a:Duration: 1 scene %0a%0aBy spending a point of Vitae, the Kindred activates this power. At a glance, they become able to see any ‘active’ supernatural effect on a person, location, object, or area within range of their perceptions, seeing it as a sort of subtle ‘glow’. By focusing on such an effect, the Kindred may scrutinize the magic itself with Uncanny Perception or Spirit’s Touch (as appropriate), rolling as normal, but becoming able to ask questions directly related to supernatural effects. %0a%0a:Some examples include, but are not limited to:%0a*Is this magic innate or external to the subject/object? %0a*What sort of supernatural power is this? %0a*What does this effect do? %0a*Was this effect created by someone whose effects I’ve studied before, and if so, who?%0a**In answering any questions, the ST should coach the reply in symbolism and visions, not plain language%0a%0aNoticing any effect meant to conceal, trick, or veil something in any way requires a Clash of Wills, though once already noticed, no Clash is required to scrutinize it with Auspex unless it specifically veils the nature of the information being sought out.%0a%0a'''This power costs 2 Experiences to learn.'''%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Cutting Words (Majesty •••, Vigor ••)''%0a%0aA vampire with Majesty can make her target fall in love, fly into a rage, sink into depression, or die of a broken heart. With the right application of power, however, a vampire can make her victim feel as if her tongue is like a whip unto the flesh. To a truly devoted victim, though, these words are like jagged shards of glass as the vampire brings down the full force of her personality. %0a%0a:Public/Private: Private%0a%0a:Cost: 1 Vitae (or more, see below) %0a%0a:Dice Pool: Presence + Intimidation/Subterfuge + Majesty - subject’s Resolve %0a%0a:Action: Instant %0a%0aTo use this Devotion, the target must be under the effects of a vampire’s Awe. The vampire must speak audibly so that the target can hear her. The words she uses determines the Skill to be rolled, Intimidation for insults and Subterfuge for veiled threats. Each success on the activation roll inflicts one bashing damage up to a maximum equal to her Majesty rating as the victim’s flesh mystically rips and tears. If the target has the Charmed Condition inflicted by the vampire, the Vampire may spend an extra Vitae to upgrade the damage to lethal (even to Vampires). Finally, if the target has the Enthralled Condition inflicted by the vampire, she does not subtract her Resolve from Cutting Words, and the Vampire may spend another Vitae to make the victim suffer the Insensate Tilt.

Upon receiving the answers to the questions, he may then ask an additional question regarding those answers per dot of Auspex, but these questions are not limited to those with yes/no answers; anything straightforward that can be answered with a few words or a short sentence can be asked. “Who is plotting to kill me?” is fine, for instance, but “What are the detailed plans of the one trying to kill me?” is not.%0a%0a:Drawback: Opening oneself up to the undercurrents of the multiverse is dangerous to those with a material mind. In addition to Omen Sensitivity’s normal drawback, the Kindred suffers the Tainted condition, representing not a consumed soul but a piece of the otherworld seeping inside them.

Active supernatural senses require a Clash of Wills to notice, study, or otherwise learn about or via any such abilities, and if the Clash of Wills is lost, the same ability can not be used to detect that specific power for the rest of the scene.

Whenever something occurs that would target the character, there is a momentary sense of danger that presents itself through the beast. While the specifics of the ‘what’ or ‘how’ may be lost on the character, the first few moments of danger seem to slow to a crawl, giving him plenty of time to assess the situation and prepare for the worst case scenario and prepare himself for incoming physical threats, or in the case of mental influences, hopefully react quickly enough to shut their opponent down. %0a%0a:Public/Private: Private%0a%0a:Cost: 1 Vitae%0a%0a:Dice Pool: None%0a%0a:Action: Reflexive %0a%0aYou may activate Spider Sense any time your character would suffer an attack or detrimental effect, though this is most often used against attacks that the Kindred is unaware of, it may be used at any time.

The blood is spent reflexively, and may be spent even when the character has failed a roll to notice a surprise attack. %0aWhen activated against a physical threat, the Kindred may either expend one use of this power to treat their failed ambush check as if it had scored one higher than the attackers, or if used against an attack the Kindred knows is coming, may reduce the number of successes rolled against them by their celerity rating. %0a%0aThis devotion can not be applied to mental or social powers, but if this power is activated during any round where an opponent declares a hostile action against them they may use the active power of interrupting an opponents action at no cost, so long as it’s used to attempt to interrupt the activation of the power.%0a%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''The Power of Love (Majesty 4 and Vigor 1, Celerity 1, or Resilience 1''%0a%0aPrivate%0a%0aLove feels good.

To use this Devotion, the target must have the Enthralled Condition inflicted by the vampire, typically through Loyalty. First, the vampire must bestow upon the subject a lover's token soaked in her vitae, such as a handkerchief. The vampire spends one Vitae plus one for every use of a Discipline her subject may use and can grant her target dots of those Disciplines up to her Majesty rating. None of the imparted Disciplines can exceed the vampire’s rating in those Disciplines. For example, if the vampire has Majesty 5, Celerity 3, Vigor 2, and Resilience 1 she could grant the target two dots of Celerity, two dots of Vigor, and one dot of Resilience. \\%0aThe target can only utilize these Disciplines while in active pursuit of a task given by the vampire and can activate them using the vitae imbued into the lover's token.

He no longer needs to actively seek out the secret powers of others; he simply needs to be closeby enough to catch their scent.%0a %0aWhenever a supernatural power is about to be used nearby the Kindred (within range of his Kindred Sense of smell), this Devotion is reflexively activated. On a success, the Beast provides minor sensory cues as to the nature and origin of the capability (whispered reflections of his own thoughts originating from the user, in the case of someone reading his mind, for instance). This happens with enough notice to allow a reflexive power of his own to be activated first (including using Celerity to pre-empt it), or for Willpower or Vitae to be spent to boost his resistance against the ability. %0a%0aIn the case of powers meant to mislead or conceal, a Clash of Wills is made instead of the normal roll; if the Kindred wins, he gets a sense of a power being used nearby, but is not shown the actual origin or nature of it (he can still boost his defenses if paranoid enough, however). This is more taxing, however; after the first such Clash in a scene, additional ones draw a point of Vitae from the Kindred’s reserves as the beast subconsciously tires (and this is not immediately noticed if the Clash fails). The Kindred may reflexively suppress the ability to sense these more subtle powers, however, to preserve Vitae.%0a %0a'''This Devotion costs 2 Experiences to learn.'''%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''False Vision (Obfuscate 4)''%0a%0aPublic/Private: Private%0a%0a:Cost: 2 Vitae%0a%0a:Dice Pool: Wits + Subterfuge + Obfuscate%0a%0a:Action: Instant%0a%0a:Duration: One Scene%0a%0aThe vampire's Beast confounds any who try and pry into it’s soul for answers placing false truths for seekers to find%0a%0aThe vampire shrouds their soul against supernatural attempts to discern information about them through supernatural means.

This often requires agents on the field who can serve a number of functions from destroying evidence, murdering witness, manipulating the media, to making effective threats. Those who act in the agency of the Invictus find their status within the Covenant empowers them in the actions required to perform their duties.This Oath can only be taken once, and not by anyone who suffers an existing blood bond to someone lacking Invictus Status. There can be no chance that the Agent will share their secrets with those outside of the status.\\%0a%0a:Effect: When serving the Invictus and their interests, the character who takes this oath may add their Status as Skill dots on a one for one basis to skills that are represent the task at hand. This can not break the cap allowed by their blood potency, nor can they add more than two dots to any one skill. This bonus may be changed, but only once per chapter. As an added benefit, when the character is dealing with mortals for the purposes of cleaning up a Masquerade breach, she may add her dots in status as an equipment bonus to social rolls. This stacks with other equipment, but may not exceed the 5 dot limit.%0a%0a:Drawback: If the Character who purchases this oath ever betrays the Secrets of the Invictus (Whether it is Masquerade Breaches themselves or Political Ambitions) they suffer an obvious source of Aggravated damage that represents their crime. Speaking secrets may burn away their tongue, turning it to ash in their mouth. Considering the tempting words of an enemy may burn away your ears leaving you deaf, and witnessing a crime against the Invictus but not taking action may cause your eyes to burst into flame. Mark your left most health box with aggravated damage and take an appropriate tilt that will not be resolved until you heal the appropriate damage. If you have other sources of aggravated damage, they must always be healed first. Any time you expect to gain the benefits of this oath, the highest ranking member of the Invictus will always know, and expect the appropriate paperwork to be filed. %0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Protean Modifications''%0a%0a!!!!''Predatory Aspects''%0a%0a:Camouflage: By altering her skin tone and even her clothes to blend into her surroundings, the Kindred becomes more difficult to notice, granting a bonus to rolls to go unnoticed equal to her Protean dots.%0a%0a:Projectile Blood: Spitting blood like a Cobra, the Kindred can temporarily render their opponents blind. Spend 1 additional Vitae beyond the activation cost of this power, the Vitae is expelled from the Kindreds mouth up to a distance of Strength x 3 yards. Roll Dexterity + Athletics - Defense, with the usual targeted attack penalty, but reduce this penalty by the character’s Protean dots. Success inflicts the Blind tilt on the opponent. The tilt is resolved if the victim of this power spends an Instant action wiping away the viscous fluid. Vitae so expelled from the body is considered inert, and does not cause Vitae Addiction or any increase in the steps of a Blood Bond.%0a%0a:Rodent’s Anatomy: Much like a Mouse or Rat caught in a Predators grasp, you know just how to move and wiggle to make an escape. If you have this power activated while in a grapple, you may add your dots in Protean to any roll to Break Free or Escape an Immobilize. Dots granted by this power may not be applied to Take Down, Damage, or the Disarm Maneuver. This power may allow the Kindred to attempt to escape an Immobilize caused by an item such as a Zip Tie or Handcuffs, make a Dexterity + Athletics roll with a penalty depending on how advanced the equipment is. Standard Rope levies a -1 penalty while Police Issue Handcuffs impose a -3. Success frees the character from the restraint.%0a%0a:Unnatural Maw: Though vampires are skilled predators, human physiology means their mouths aren't their greatest weapon. Via Protean, the vampire increases the useful radius of their bite, whether by 'unhinging' their jaw in the manner of snakes, growing circular rows of lamprey-like teeth or some other animalistic method. When feeding 'Violently', they increase their effective 'blood taken per turn' maximum in grappling and other situations by their Protean dots. Used outside combat, this effectively turns any feeding into 'The Assault' instead of The Kiss.%0a%0a:Venom: The Kindred can produce powerful venom glands, like a spider or a snake, that they may excrete when they bite someone or hit them with a natural weapon granted by Protean. This counts as a Poison with a Toxicity equal to the Kindred’s Protean dots. In combat it inflicts the (Moderate) Poison Tilt.%0a%0a:Viper's Gift: Vipers have the ability to track their prey through proteins in their bites. This Protean modification grants a similar ability. For the purposes of tracking a bitten victim by scent (p91, Vampire), the Kindred gains a dice bonus equal to their Protean until the end of the scene. This ability also allows other vampires to be tracked in a similar fashion to mortals. If the Kindred has other natural weapons granted by Protean, they can elect to cause this effect on a successful strike.%0a%0a:Wolf’s Hide: Adapting his flesh to that of a Predatory Animal like a Wolf or Lion, the Kindred becomes unnaturally resilient to damage. He enjoys an armor rating of 2/0 against any bashing attacks and a rating of 1/0 against incoming lethal damage. This armor does not apply to banes that the Kindred suffers from, but stacks with any armor worn.%0a%0a:Wolf's Jaw: The Kindred's jaws, tongue and voice-box shift to match those of a werewolf. This alters their voice, giving it a harsh, gravelly quality when speaking english but allowing them to speak First Tongue normally if they have taken two dots in the Spirit Speech merit. This also allows them to make a bite attack (0L, using Brawl) without first grappling their opponent, but does not allow them to Feed in combat without grappling. %0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Unnatural Aspects''%0a%0a:Long Death: The Kindred produces a powerful hemotoxin as the Beast devours the subject’s blood from within them. This poison is delivered through the Kindred’s bite, or through any natural weapons created by Protean. This poison deals Lethal damage and has a Toxicity of their Blood Potency. The damage happens once per hour up to Protean times, but never during the day. In Combat this prouces the (Grave) Poison Tilt, except that the victim takes a penalty to their Stamina + Resolve roll each turn equal to the Kindred’s Protean. Vampire victims lose Vitae instead of taking damage while Ghouls lose Vitae before health levels.%0a%0a:Monstrous Hide: The Kindred transmutes their bones and flesh, forming layers of tough leathery skin, carapace, or other natural armor. This counts as 3/5 armor with a -2 penalty to defense and a -1 penalty to speed, which does not stack with other armor (but note Resilience is NOT armor).%0a%0a:Noxious Miasma: The Kindred transmutes their body until it is like an open sepulcher from which the death and decay of every feeding spill forth. Those who come within Protean*2 yards of the Kindred gain the (Grave) Sick tilt as the Beast-tainted stench causes their bodies to heave, vomit, and convulse. This aspect affects vampires despite their normal immunity to disease and lack of breathing, though the tilt may be ‘healed’ normally. It may affect other supernaturals normally immune to disease with a Clash of Wills.

A line must be cut in his flesh, then, with a similarly prepared scalpel, with the wound originating at the manacles and drawing down over his forearm (another 1L damage). Finally, the Kindred must spill a number of Vitae up to the Nest's rating into the mouth of a Torpored Vampire that he wishes to awaken.%0a%0a:Outcome: The energy of the Wyrm's Nest flows into the Kindred's blood, enhancing its potency and energizing the Vampire imbibing the arcane substance. The donor's Blood Potency is treated as a number of dots higher equal to the Vitae spent (capped by the Nest rating, as mentioned), solely for the sake of determining if it's potent enough to awaken the Torpored Kindred.%0a%0aFor instance, if a character with Blood Potency 3 uses this at a Nest of 3 dots, and spends all 3 Vitae towards this purpose, they'd count as BP6 and thus could awaken someone of Blood Potency 4 or lower.%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Calm Before The Storm''%0a%0a:Prerequisite Coil: Leash the Beast (Wyrm)%0a%0a:Public/Private: Public%0a%0a:Procedure: The Vampire has found the exact part of him that the beast controls, that part of his brain where rage is contained and released, and he has learned to create a concoction that affects this part of the Kindred mind. %0aThe mixture of blood, which requires at least a small amount of werewolf blood, takes a half hour to mix properly, and when consumed gives the imbiber the ability to remain lucid even while under the effects of frenzy.%0a%0a:Outcome: The concoction both strengthens and controls the Dragon’s beast.

However, when the Kindred is next provoked to frenzy within that same night, he may spend a willpower and attempt to Ride the Wave. If successful, he remains lucid during his frenzy. He still gains all the benefits of the Frenzy, but is not compelled to sate the beasts desires.

The Essence (gained via Fuel The Fire) within him functions as a filter as the process completes its cycle.%0a%0aFinally placing a needle through the cork of the wine bottle and placing the liquid once more into the vessel. As the Essence seeps into the bottle it slightly alters the vintage inside creating not only a flavorful substance that can be consumed by Kindred but giving the vintage the capability to hold onto the Essence and store it.%0a%0a:Outcome: The bottle of wine, once properly prepared by the Dragon, may now become a storage vessel for Essence, being able to store up to a total of the Dragons dots in Zirnitra.%0aThe Essence stored within the Wine imbues it with a “flavor” based upon the Resonance or source of the Essence. %0aThe Essence may be drawn out of the wine in order to fuel abilities or powers that harness such energies, though doing so ruins the vintage and it may not be used again for the purpose of this Scale.%0a%0a:Draw Back: The concoction, once consumed, creates a sense of euphoria in the drinker. This feeling can be so intense that it causes addiction. Just like Blood Addiction the drinker must make the associated roll for addition if failed he/she now suffers from the Addiction Condition as he/she becomes consumed with a need to relive that one brief moment, forever chasing after it.%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Blood of Kings''%0a%0a:Public/Private: Public%0a%0a:Prerequisite Coil: Call to Serve (Voivode 3)%0a%0a:Procedure: Within a Wyrm's Nest, the Kindred uses a specially formed alchemically enhanced set of manacles to tie himself to the ground. Both the manacles themselves and the anchoring end have a large spike in them, which must be driven into ground and flesh, dealing 1L damage to the Kindred. A line must be cut in his flesh, then, with a similarly prepared scalpel, with the wound originating at the manacles and drawing down over his forearm (another 1L damage). Finally, the Kindred must spill a number of Vitae up to the Nest's rating into the mouth of a Torpored Vampire that he wishes to awaken. %0a%0a:Outcome: The energy of the Wyrm's Nest flows into the Kindred's blood, enhancing its potency and energizing the Vampire imbibing the arcane substance. The donor's Blood Potency is treated as a number of dots higher equal to the Vitae spent (capped by the Nest rating, as mentioned), solely for the sake of determining if it's potent enough to awaken the Torpored Kindred.%0a%0aFor instance, if a character with Blood Potency 3 uses this at a Nest of 3 dots, and spends all 3 Vitae towards this purpose, they'd count as BP6 and thus could awaken someone of Blood Potency 4 or lower. %0a!!!%25center%25''Bounty of the Wyre''%0a%0a:Prerequisite Coil: The Dragon’s Breath (Zirnitra ••••)%0a%0a:Additional Prerequisites: Scale-Fuel the Fire%0a%0aAfter having spent much time bonding and attuning to his Nest the Dragon now has a much deeper understanding of its purpose within the world. This understanding comes when the Dragon has a connection with the Resonance of the Nest. Due to the Dragons strong connection to the Nest he may act as a vector of these energies thus allowing him to grant this ability to those closest to him, by sharing this knowledge.%0a%0a:Procedure: The Dragon follows the process of the Scale Fuel the Fire, but must deepen his understanding even further by giving part of himself to the Nest in exchange for such bountiful knowledge of its being. The Dragon takes 1 unavoidable point of aggravated DMG per point of the Nest and must spend a point of Willpower in equal amounts.%0a%0a:Outcome: Rolls pertaining to the Resonance of the Nest now gain a dice trick quality depending on the strength of the Nest, if fueled with the Nest’s energy. This bonus is only applicable to such tasks that fall within the quality of the Resonance of the Nest utilized for this Scale. %0a%0a:Resonance Strength of Nest:%0a*1%0a**9 again%0a*3%0a**8 again%0a*4;5%0a**Rolls become exceptional on 3 successes rather than 5%0a%0aThe use of such knowledge can be straining on the mind and due to the amount of focus it takes to use the ability of the Scale it must be feed with energy from its source; 1 energy gained from the Nest via the Prerequisite Scale or otherwise must be spent per roll by someone ‘attuned’ to it somehow.%0a%0a:Drawback: The use of this Scale is only possible so long as the vector Dragon carries within himself a small portion of the resonance from the Nest.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Chemical Lobotomy''%0a%0aPublic/Private: Private%0a%0a:Prerequisite Coil: The Dragon’s Breath (Zirnitra ••••)%0a%0a:Procedure: While present at a Wyrm’s Nest, the Dragon mixes various neurotoxic substances together with a few drops of Vitae, and a small amount of spinal fluid, and the substance is then brought up to a boil. The mixture must be rapidly combined and continually stirred or otherwise mixed until it cools, and then is immediately either consumed or stored in a specially prepared, sealed glass vial. %0a%0a:Outcome: If not immediately consumed, the substance will last up to a day per dot of the Kindred’s Blood Potency after the fact, before it goes inert. When imbibed, however, the horrible substance immediately goes to work, stimulating and burning away a small portion of the victim’s mind. For those susceptible to neurotoxins, this is a Toxicity 5 substance, and whether susceptible to the toxin or not, the consumer loses a dot of a Mental or Social attribute (player’s choice) which ‘heals’ like aggravated damage, and suffers the Confused Condition until it’s healed, as the substance physically assaults their mind.%0a%0aAt that point, however, all other mundane mental conditions and tilts are immediately removed from the character (whether positive or negative), not counting as resolved, and the Dragon then makes a Clash of Wills against any mental supernatural effect or condition affecting the character as well; he rolls Blood Potency + Coil of Zirnitra. By spending an extra point of Vitae during the substance’s creation, the Zirnitra rating is doubled for the Clash dice pool. Unlike the mundane conditions, only hostile or negative supernatural effects are targeted by the substance, per the judgment of the Dragon. %0a%0aThis will not remove the Blood Bond or similar inherently ‘template’ abilities.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Dragon Bile''%0a%0a:Prerequisite Coil: Wyrm •••••%0a%0a:Public/Private: Private%0a%0a:Procedure: The Kindred mixes an alchemical compound and infuses his own blood into it as a means to house the Beast. Then the procedure of placing the essence of his Beast in the concoction creates a balm of a uniquely Toxic Hemo-caustic nature.Of course the most difficult part of the process is extracting the needed vitae from the Kindred while he is in Frenzy. This is a necessity as it’s only during this point that he is at the peak of being one with the internal monster, thus being able to draw on the essence of the enraged inner self.%0a%0a:Outcome: The Beast infused Hemo-caustic substance burns through the blood of the target devouring it from within causing as a Toxicity 5 poison.%0a%0aOnce absorbed through the skin or mucus membrane, even entry via a wound, the Beast does as it always has and will hunt, devour, and destroy them from the inside out as it destroys their blood in a frenzy.%0a%0aIn Kindred the effect is even more violent as it destroys Vitae as well equal to the Toxicity of the poison.%0aUnlike most Hemo Toxins this one is of a rare nature, rather than a Kindred being able to burn the poison from its system with Vitae he must Lash Out against the Beast that is attempting to destroy him from the inside out in order to drive it from his system, beating a dice pool equal to the Toxicity.%0a%0aIf not stopped, the poison causes the Poisoned Tilt in combat or damage outside of combat with the normal systems, even to Kindred.%0a%0a:Drawback: As stated in the procedure the need of Vitae from a Kindred in Frenzy is in and of itself this is a very dangerous endeavor that could lead to the loss of more than one life.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Eldritch Operation''%0a%0a:'Public/Private: Private%0a%0a:Prerequisite Coil: Sun's Forgotten Kiss (Ascendant 5)%0a%0a:Procedure: The Kindred sets the 'patient' up within a Wyrm's Nest, using specially attuned tools, alchemical reagents, and a sort of 'trance' to draw the energy of the Nest into the patient to more easily manipulate their flesh, allowing them to use more 'occult' means of performing the healing; odd geomantic symbols are carved into flesh, strange substances born of Vitae seal wounds together, and energy ripples and flows into wounds, cauterizing them. It's likely a masquerade breach if witnessed by unknowing mortals, and the process doesn't do anything to dull the sensations, often making the experience painful and unsettling; on most mortals (those with Integrity), it's a breaking point if they're not put under some other way. %0a%0a:Outcome: Within the Nest (and ONLY within a Wyrm's Nest), the character becomes better able to mold the patient's flesh, stabilizing it to the extent of allowing these stranger methodologies to work on the patient's wounds. %0a%0aThis allows the Kindred to perform 'intensive care' on the patient within the Nest, without the normal hospital or similar level of equipment needed to do so; a small kit (which can sit within a size 1 container) of special tools and substances will suffice. This also provides the following benefits to the process:%0a%0a*The time required per roll is halved.%0a*A number of wounds equal to the Nest Rating can be downgraded in a single day, instead of just one. %0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Empower the Lingering Spark''%0a%0a:Public/Private: Private%0a%0a:Prerequisite Coil: The Dragon’s Breath (Zirnitra 4)%0a%0a:Procedure: A piece of tangible supernatural equipment (per GMC or the Free Rules Update pg 241) is prepared with a mixture of the Dragon’s Vitae (at least 3 points), dust and other miscellanea from the Nest it’s performed at (it only works at a Nest), and purified water that’s been kept at at least 3 different Ley Line Nodes for an hour or more, the mixture of which is cooked together and then poured over the object in a pattern that aligns with the energy flow of the Nest itself. %0a%0a:Outcome: The Nest’s energy is used to empower the supernatural object, flooding into it and supercharging its ability to affect the wider world. Its equipment bonus (or any similar numerical bonus it applies) is raised by up to half the Dragon’s rating in the Coil of Zirnitra, rounded up, and this CAN bring it above the maximum equipment bonus. This increase lasts for a number of Nights equal to the Nest’s rating by default, but if purchased as an Enhanced Item (per the merit in Mage the Awakening, but ONLY for raised equipment bonus), either by the Kindred or an intended recipient (they’re effectively ‘written into’ the ritual), it will last permanently.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Essence Rain''%0a%0a:Public/Private: Public%0a%0a:Prerequisite Coils: Call to Serve%0a%0a:Procedure: Find yourself a Wyrms Nest. One with a flat surface is preferable, otherwise a table is fine. Draw your sacrificial table using a line of rock salt, a circle containing a star of 3+2N points where N is the amount of Essence to be created. Place items representing the resonance you wish the essence to have at each point of the star. Place N pinches of grave dirt, werewolf fur, or living cocoons at the centre of the star. Pour N vitae into your preferred vessel. Starting at the centre, pour the vitae in a spiral until all items within the circle have been touched by the vitae. Place the vessel at the centrepoint. Close the circle by touching the outside ring with mortal blood. Walk around the circle in a deosil direction and using your right hand touch each item where the vitae has been dripped in order to transform the vitae into a liquid form of essence. %0a%0a:Outcome: The Dragon gains N points of liquid essence of the desired resonance held within the vessel. This can either be spilled out all at once or at a rate of one per turn. Once spilled, the liquid evaporates and the essence can be used by any entity or fetish within 2 metres. It can otherwise be stored indefinately.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Fuel the Fire''%0a%0a:Prerequisite Coil: Ascendancy (The Coil of Zirnitra)%0a%0a:Additional Perquisite: Nest Guardian and Safe Place at 1+%0a*In order for the Dragon to become as close as he needs to be with the Nest for this Scale to work he must have a functioning bond with the location.%0a%0a:Public/Private: Private%0a%0aBy tapping into the mystic powers of a Wyrms Nest itself the Dragon has learned to utilize those energizes there in and harness them to fuel his own supernal powers. After a successful meditation on the Wyrms Nest itself the Dragon can then tap into its source energy: Essence for a Locus, Mana for a Hallow.%0a%0a:Procedure: In order to tap into the source energy of the Nest the Kindred must meditate at the Nest itself. Sometimes this can take several hours depending on how apt the Dragon is with the art of Meditation. Once the Dragons mind has been cleared of all distractions he then attunes himself to the Wyrms Nest (This procedure has to be done at least once a month in order for the Dragon to maintain his connection to the Wyrms Nest)%0a%0aOnce the Dragon has completed the task of attuning himself to the Wyrms Nest he can feel the flow of the mystic energies as he himself becomes connected to it. This deep connection then allows the Dragon to pull forth a portion of those energies that make up the Nest and fuse them with him. The task of the fusing this supernal fuel into himself is completed by drawing these energies into himself and infusing his being with them.%0a%0aThe Dragon may only pull out energy equal to the rank or rate of the Nest itself to a maximum of five, and no more than one time per nest per chapter. This is a near intimate connection between Dragon and Wyrms Nest and so the resonance of the Nest always manifests itself in some physical way.%0a%0a:Outcome: Once the Dragon has attuned himself to the Nest he may then draw out the supernal power that builds up in the Nest and use it in a variety of ways.%0a*'''1)''' The Dragon may use the source energy to fuel his own abilities as if it where Vitae (and it’s capped the same way)%0a*'''2)''' The Dragon may pass the energy to other Kindred on a 1 for 2 ratio.%0a*'''3)''' Due to the Dragons attunement to the Nest he may now sense its well being. Like a gardener caring for his prized rose bush, anything effecting the Nest directly such as it being damaged, drained of its supernal energies or actions affecting its resonance now react in such a way that the Dragon not only knows but feels what is happening.%0a*'''At the end of the month any supernal fuel not used bleeds away from the Kindred and is wasted.'''%0a%0a:Drawback: Any failure is automatically a dramatic failure. A new meditation roll is made in such a case, and Successes indicate the amount of Vitae that is sapped from the Dragon and pulled into the Nest itself. This amount of blood loss can exceed the normal maximum of five. As well due to the ripping of blood from the Dragon he takes one lethal damage per point of blood lost in this manner. As well this upsetting of the balance with the Nest leaves the Dragon unable to attune to the Wyrms Nest for the following month.%0a%0aIn addition, multiple Dragons may not use this on the same Nest in the same night; the second Dragon to attempt to do so automatically suffers a dramatic failure, as above.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Gift of the Mind''%0a%0a:Prerequisite Coil: Embolden Potential (Zirnitra)%0a%0a:Public/Private: Public%0a%0a:Procedure: Through the study of psychic phenomena the Kindred has learned what areas within his own mind unlock various Psychic abilities, and through use of his research has learned to blend a mixture of his own cerebral fluids with other occult herbs and his own blood.%0a%0aThis serum takes several hours to create due to its nature. The Kindred must first pin point what Psychic ability he wishes to gain accesses to. Then he must extract fluid from that part of his own brain in order to capture the Epigenetic information. The extraction process is extremely painful as it requires the use of medical tools being inserted into the brain by the Kindred using the Process. %0a*(Take 1 unavoidable point of aggravated damage)%0a%0aOnce the extraction has been completed the Kindred then creates the Substrate that the fluid is placed into. His own Vitae (rendered unable to create the Bond or Addiction) in combination with a variety of arcane herbs now function as the substrate material in which the cerebral fluid will carry along the Epigenetic Psychic Data to the imbiber.%0a%0a:Outcome: The serum can now be imbibed by another to temporarily allow them to utilize the selected Psychic ability. Once ingested the ability is only available for one scene as the materials brake down in the imbibers system. The substance degrades after a month; if not used by that point, it becomes useless.%0a%0a:Drawback: Since the serum temporarily rewires and rewrites the imbibers own brain chemistry in order to give them the Psychic ability it causes a bit of disorientation and one hell of a headache. As a means to lessen these effects a Point of Willpower must be spent and a reflexive Stamina + Resolve roll is made. If failed the imbiber suffers from the Drugged Condition for the remainder of the scene regardless of the spent Willpower. (The Willpower does not add the standard bonus to a roll)%0a%0a:Note: all costs such as Willpower and or use of Vitae to activate the psychic power still have to be utilized during the Extraction process or the serum does not work%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Harmonize''%0a%0a:Public/Private: Private%0a%0a:Prerequisite Coil: Zirnitra 5  %0a%0a:Procedure: The Dragon lets set the crystal/gem/precious stone in a highly caustic alchemical mixture over a period of 24 hours giving it time to be absorbed into the crystal/gem/precious stone making the substance inert.%0a%0aHe then lets the crystal/gem/precious stone once again soak over a 24 hour period; this time in his own Vitae or the Vitae of the Dragon whom the harmonizing is being performed for.%0a%0aAfter the crystal/gem/precious stone has yet again soaked it must be placed within the confines of the Nest itself where it will rest its final 24 hours gathering the resonance of the Nest to complete the process of harmonizing.%0a%0aOnce the Harmonizing process has been completed the Dragon is ready to awaken the powers within by making a Wits + Occult activation roll. %0a%0a:Outcome: Once the Harmonizing process has been completed the Dragon awakens the powers within by making a Wits + Occult activation roll. The Pseudo Nest will then be active for use for a period of day’s equal to success on the roll. The Dragon creates a crystal/gem/precious stone that resonates on the same level as the Nest. This gives the Dragon the ability to use the crystal/gem/precious stone in place of the Nest for instances of Scale usage giving the Dragon more mobility for use of Scales that require a Nest. Harmonize ONLY functions for the use of Scales that DO NOT affect a Nest directly.%0a%0a:Drawback: The crystal/gem/precious stone only has a usage span equal to the days in successes before going inert and having to be redone. %0a%0aAs with other Scales, vectoring supernatural energies has a physical toll on the Dragon. For each level of Nest rating he takes one unavoidable point of LEATHAL DMG during the creation and Harmonizing process.%0a%0a:Imprinting: the Nest Crystal will only function for the Dragon whose Vitae was used in the harmonizing.%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Mark of the Voivode''%0a%0a:Public/Private: Private%0a%0a:Prerequisite Coil: Voivode Undisputed (Voivode 4)%0a%0a:Procedure: A special, mildly unstable concoction is put together, formed of the Kindred's Vitae, various semi-stable chemical compounds, and a small sample of the subject's bile, and put into a syringe. It's then immediately injected into the subject's neck, wrist, or thigh, a painful process that inflicts the Insensate tilt on them for a turn and leaves them dealing with a Toxicity 5 poison running through their veins, and the Scarred condition.%0a%0a:Outcome:  Once the poison has either run its course or been resisted (with the usual roll), a small bit of scarring (often in a shape meaningful to the Dragon) forms along the veins nearest the injection, which cools noticeably to the subject whenever the Vampire is close-by, due to the connection they retain with their blood. Because of that connection, said subject also effectively gains the benefits of the Protected merit regarding the Dragon for a week per dot of Blood Potency of the Kindred, even if the normal prerequisites aren't met (so long as the subject's living). This does not cause the blood bond or Vitae Addiction, despite the use of the Kindred's Vitae in the substance.%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Preserve the Crimson Vial''%0a%0a:Prerequisite Coil: Into the Fold (Voivode)%0a%0a:Public/Private: Private%0a%0a:Procedure: With a mix of imparting part of the Kindreds will and a concoction of Alchemical Agents, the Kindred is able to preserve the nutritional qualities of blood. The blood may be kept in an object that is hermetically sealed and at least large enough to hold one pint of liquid. While this lengthens the time in which Blood or Vitae may be used for consumption, it is not indefinite. All blood goes bad, but the reagents used to preserve the potency of the blood do at the very least extend this life, using the power of the Kindreds beast as a medium%0a%0a:Outcome: The object can hold up to (Blood Potency+Coil of Voivode) traits of Blood or Vitae, though the power of the Potency of the Kindreds Vitae condenses the sheer amount of blood down to the size of about a pint. The amount of blood that is used in the ritual must be equal to the blood taken from however many subjects take part in the process. Each willpower spent can either extend the life of the Blood or Vitae by an additional week, or it can add to the storage capacity of the container (minimum of 1, spent on duration). Mortals with the Producer Merit grant double the benefit of the stored blood, as per the merit. Also, Kindred Vitae so stored causes Bonding as per normal, but does not cause Vitae addiction.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Sanguine Empowerment''%0a%0a:Prerequisite Coil: Embolden Potential (Zirnitra)%0a%0a:Public/Private: Private%0a%0a:Procedure: The procedure requires the bone of a creature that had some sort of supernatural power to it in life, whether a ghouled animal, mortal with a supernatural merit, werewolf, or otherwise. The bone is ground into a fine powder (or sludge, depending on its age), and then mixed with a pint or so of human blood. The Subject, who must be a Kindred (and can be the Dragon), then consumes the paste that results, using the Blush of Life to be sure he can hold it down for at least an hour. Within that time period, the paste is ‘digested’ and absorbed, rather than being vomited up at the end.%0a%0a:Outcome: The unnatural remnant of power is absorbed by the Kindred, providing a bonus to his own supernatural potency. For the sake of any dice pools involving Blood Potency, the Kindred adds half their dots in the Coil of Zirnitra (round up, minimum of 1), though this doesn’t affect anything relying on the rating instead of a direct roll (such as Sunlight damage, derived frenzy bonuses, or maximum Attributes); for instance, contesting a Discipline, a Clash of Wills, or Lashing out are all affected.%0a%0aThe effects of the Scale last for the following week. The Kindred may only have a number of ‘active’ uses of the Scale at any one time equal to his Blood Potency; any additional uses of the Procedure before another fades simply fails.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Taste of Power''%0a%0a:Prerequisite Coil: Ascendancy (The Coil of Zirnitra)%0a%0a:Public/Private: Public%0a%0aThe Dragon may concoct a solution (potion) from the blood of an individual, thus granting a temporary usage of one of the Vampire’s Disciplines.%0a%0aTo do this, the Dragon mixes a drought created in equal parts of the donator’s blood, the Dragons blood and several other enhancing and binding arcane substances, including the sap of a rather rare breed of Mandrake. The creator of the drought must have and understand not only Occult knowledge pertaining to the herbs and substances but must have medical understanding as to properly mix the blood without it spoiling the concoction. Intelligence + Occult is rolled first, representing the proper knowledge of the components involved, followed by Wits + Medicine to combine them without spoiling it (or accidentally creating something toxic). Exceptional success on the latter adds to the duration of the Discipline by one day or one use per exceptional.%0a%0a:Outcome: The imbiber may use the donator’s Discipline as if it were one of his own. The potion lasts one day per point of blood potency of the Dragon that creates the potion once imbibed, or until the Discipline has been used a single time (unless an additional use has been added as per above).%0a%0a:Drawback: As the substance burns through its unnatural course, it ends with a painful crash. The imbiber takes one point of unavoidable bashing per level of the Discipline being used upon its use.%0a*(Note: Activation rolls, Willpower and or Vitae coast are still paid for by the imbiber of the drought.)%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Trapping the Beast’s Hunger''%0a%0a:Prerequisite Coil: Beast’s Hunger (Wyrm ••)%0a%0a:Public/Private: Private%0a%0a:Procedure: The Dragon takes a natural Adder Stone (availability 3), paints an adjuration for the Beast in blood and lets it simmer in an alchemical concoction that includes human bile. Over the next six hours the Dragon must Lash Out with the Monstrous Beast. Then the subject must devour the stone whole, dealing 1 Aggravated damage that can not be reduced.%0a%0a:Outcome: The stone sits in the subject’s stomach for one week before they vomit it back up. While there, the stone soaks up Vitae like it once did poison. The subject ignores the first point of Vitae ingested in a scene, the first Vitae from each mortal from a feeding roll, and the first Vitae gotten from any instance of using the Herd merit no matter how many dots are used at once. Further Vitae goes to feed the stone until it is full (5 plus the creator’s dots in the Coil of the Wyrm). A point of willpower allows the subject to spend the blood in the stone as though it was in their pool for one turn, or to transfer any amount of blood from the stone to their pool. The stone may be fed even if the consumer’s heart has been removed, but transferring Vitae to the consumer’s pool requires them to spill the Vitae onto their heart. Mortals may only feed the stone with Vitae from Kindred, and unless the stone is full they suffer an unquenchable hunger and the Deprived Condition.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Unity of Faction''%0a%0a:Public/Private: Private%0a%0a:Prerequisite Coil: The Vast Dynasty (Voidvode •••••)%0a%0a:Additional Prerequisites: Unity of Purpose, Unity of Spirit%0a%0a:Procedure: During a renewal or performance of Unity of Purpose, the Kindred must, at the completion of the ritual, consume the substance, taking the Humbled Condition as the substance racks his mind with his place as a single part of the whole. The smoke then billows forth not from the bowl, but from his eyes, nose, and mouth, the disorienting process draining 3 points of Willpower away from him.%0a%0a:Outcome: Those that inhale the smoke are brought even closer together than Unity of Purpose normally allows for. In addition to its typical advantages, those involved in it count as being part of the same Pack/Coterie/Motley/similar grouping for the sake of benefits gained via Merits and Powers. This does not inherently allow anyone to buy merits they normally couldn’t, however, nor to use such Powers themselves, simply to count as a member (for instance, this would allow safe access into a “Motley” Hollow, or allow Pack Rites to affect members of Unity).%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Unity of Purpose''%0a%0a:Prerequisite Coil: The Vast Dynasty (Voivode •••••)%0a%0a:Public/Private: Private%0a%0a:Procedure: The Dragon, while within a Wyrm’s Nest, mixes at least 2 (or more, see below) points of Vitae, a drop of blood from every potential participant, and a cup of expensive wine (at least Availability 3) together in a gold-lined container. The substance must then be stirred for at least an hour without any pause, which requires a successful Resolve + Stamina roll.%0a%0a:Outcome: The Dragon is able to use the substance to form a unique bond among a close circle, represented by those with dots in Mystery Cult Initiation (or a similar merit) in the same group as the Dragon. Once completed and left in open air for at least a minute, the substance boils into an unnaturally black, shadowy smoke, which can be inhaled by, at most, a number of cultists equal to the Dragon’s Blood Potency +1 for each additional Vitae used. Both they and the Dragon gain a sort of unity of purpose towards the group’s ideals and members, focusing on it to an unnatural extent, akin to the effects of a Blood Bond. %0a%0aThis has the following effects:%0a%0a*All characters lose a point of Willpower immediately, to help ‘empower’ the bond, and lose another each month.%0aThe characters are protected from new Blood Bonds from outside the group (but not each other), akin to a third stage bond.%0a%0a*Beneficial Powers improve duration akin to a third stage bond’s effect when used on another cultist. This has no effect on Awakened magic’s duration, though.%0a%0a*Members are considered to have at least a Strong sympathetic bond for the sake of Sympathetic magic (via Mage).%0a%0a*Being forced to work against other cultists OR the cult’s ideals causes a form of intense spiritual duress, which helps members shake off supernatural influence. %0a%0a*When affected by a power that would force or influence a cultist to cause any sort of harm/problem to other cultists, the cult as a whole, or the group’s goals, or reveal cult information, the character may roll a Clash of Wills (Supernatural Tolerance + Mystery Cult Initiation, +4 for duration) to ignore the effect. %0a**However, the character suffers a condition/other drawback as if he’d failed a Breaking Point roll, as appropriate to the character type (but doesn’t lose Integrity/etc).%0a%0a*Willingly betraying the cult/cultists causes a Breaking point for ANY Integrity equivalent, as if a Humanity/etc 1 sin/act, or with a -5 penalty if dependent on an attribute roll (for a Werewolf, it’s towards the closest of Spirit/Flesh to their current Harmony). %0a**In addition, the character loses all dots of Mystery Cult Initiation in the group (Sanctity applies), and takes an unavoidable resistant aggravated damage per dot lost.%0a%0a*Cultists never have a Hostile impression between each other, no matter what, so long as they still have their [[City.MysteryCult|MCI]].%0aThe benefits fade when a Blood Bond normally would (typically a year), but it can be renewed with a re-use of the Scale at any point. %0a%0a*The Scale can also be repeated to add new members into the affected populace.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Unity of Power''%0a%0a:Public/Private: Private%0a%0a:Prerequisite: Ascendancy (Zirnitra •••••)%0a%0a:Procedure: The Dragon, who must be under the effects of Unity of Purpose and Unity of Spirit, must work with at least 3 others (who must have a pool of supernatural energy of some kind) under the same effect within a Wyrm’s Nest that’s claimed by 1 or more members of that group. All four individuals donate a point of energy to a metallic object that’s prepared with geomantic carvings. The Dragon’s Vitae should be applied last, the blood physically traced over the designs, and the object is then buried or otherwise stored ‘within’ the nest overnight. %0a%0a:Outcome: The shared resonance of the group is then ‘recognized’ by the Nest itself, and a feedback of energy flows forth into all those under the effects of Unity of Purpose that step foot in the Nest’s area within the next Chapter. Any such characters affected may spend a point of Willpower and suffer 1 point of unavoidable/resistant lethal damage (it cannot be prevented with any form of armor, and magical healing does not work on it), as they allow the energy to burn through their patterns. However, the next time they use a supernatural power of any kind, the nest’s energy reinforces it, and they gain a bonus equal to the Nest’s rating. If used within the Nest itself, it also provides the 9-Again benefit. %0a%0aAny given individual may only be under the effect of 1 ‘charge’ of this ability at a time (which may only occur once per use of the Scale), and using the Scale more often than once per Chapter will damage the Nest, suppressing it for the next full month.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Unity of Spirit''%0a%0a:Public/Private: Private%0a%0a:Prerequisite Coil: Ascendancy (Zirnitra •••••)%0a%0a:Additional Prerequisite: Unity of Purpose%0a%0a:Procedure: The Sorcerer, who must be under the effects of Unity of Purpose, must feed on at least 3 different types of supernatural creatures (Mortal characters with supernatural merits count) under the effect of that Scale with him, or more if desired, and keep that Vitae within his system while within a Wyrm’s Nest of at least level 3 for an hour or more. At the end of that period, while still within the Nest, he slits his wrist and empties the retrieved blood (now in the form of his Vitae) into a large enough container. It’s then mixed with an equal amount of a potent acid and several odd occult ingredients, which must be allowed to dissolve within it. Without healing the wounds, he must then dip his arms into the resulting, bubbling mixture, and focus his will on the combined resonance (Which costs 1 point of Willpower). %0a%0a:Outcome: The substance both boils into the air and flows into the Kindred’s veins, burning him deeply in the process (he takes 2 unavoidable aggravated damage), but allowing him to absorb a bit of the nature of the blood donated, and spread that to others that share the Bond of Unity of Purpose with him. All those sharing the bond of Unity of Purpose with the Dragon find themselves better able to benefit from the powers used by each other. For the purposes of the effects of supernatural powers used by members only, each member counts as the most beneficial of the ‘donor’ templates when deciding if they’re a valid target or what the final effects are. This won’t let someone do something they normally can’t that’s required to gain the benefit (Like for something that provides a bonus to a Uratha’s shapeshifting), nor will it provide them non-template prerequisites they don’t meet. For the sake of abilities granted that rely on supernatural energy, however, 1 Willpower and 1 of the character’s own energy form (mortals can spend an extra willpower) can replace 1 point of cost of another energy type, but only for something directly granted by a power (such as an Influence by a Rite). This will similarly not grant any other template-based abilities, such as a Vampire’s or Werewolf’s regenerative abilities, and so powers relying on that might be dangerous or impossible to use on those lacking it. %0a%0aThis lasts for as long as Unity of Purpose does, including any renewal of it.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Ward the Wyre''%0a%0a:Prerequisite Coil: The Dragon’s Breath (Zirnitra ••••)%0a%0a:Additional Prerequisites: Fuel the Fire%0a%0a:Public/Private: Private%0a%0aThe Dragon has developed a fundamental understanding of how Dragons Nests energies function, and by exerting himself over those energies he has learned to shape them into a protective ward surrounding its area of influence.%0aProcess: The Dragon makes an extended Wits + Occult roll minus the rating of the Nest, needing a total of successes equal to the rating of the Nest. %0a%0a:Outcome: The Dragon creates a resonance based Ward to surround the Nest and protect it. The Wards generated by this Scale are meant as a protective measure only affecting outside sources that would cause harm or disruption (including information-gathering); such actions, whether mundane or supernatural take a penalty equal to the Nest’s rating (&#8722;1 further on an exceptional success in the Procedure). The Dragon/s that utilize this Scale my designate rather or not a person is allowed to bypass these Wards much in the same way as those designated by the Perilous Nest Merit.%0a%0aDue to the Ward being generated by the Nest itself it cannot produce such effects indefinitely, thus the life span of the Ward is based upon the strength of the Nest. It can be held in place for one week per point of the Nests rating.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Wyrms Bastion''%0a%0a:Public/Private: Private%0a%0a:Prerequisite Coil: Ascendancy %0a%0a:Procedure: The Dragon creates an Alchemic concoction of Herbs that connects him ever more to the Wyrms Nest and allows him to call on its supernal energies to generate and wrap himself in a form of supernal armor dependant on the Strength of the Nest. Outcome: The Nest wraps the Dragon in an unseen shroud of metaphysical armor offing him a degree of protection. So long as the Dragon remains connected to the Nest the armor is ever present but it must be activated by spending a point of Supernatural Fuel for the scene. This armor is equal to half the level of the Nest rounded up that he is connected to. The supernal armor granted may stack with that of mundane armor and/or natural armors. %0a%0a:Drawback: The Scale requires that a DOT of Willpower be used to connect Nest and Dragon.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Fiends Blessing''%0a%0a:Prerequisite Coil: Ascendancy%0a%0a:Public/Private: Private%0a%0a:Procedure: With a little bit of effort the Dragon taps into the Nest and then alters the flow of energies from it into his own hands as a means to manipulate the physical form of another creature altering their flesh as if it were clay resting on an artist’s wheel.%0a%0aThe Dragon first makes a Roll to Resist Frenzy since he is tapping so deeply into the Energies that flow through the Nest, as they might drive him mad, he then may redirect those energies into his own hands imbuing them with the capability to manipulate flesh as he wills it.%0a%0aOnce this is accomplished the Dragon may roll Intelligence + Medicine to create the changes he wishes. The use of Intelligence + Medicine replaces the normal crafting roll for equipment.%0a%0a:Outcome: The subject’s body is forever changed. The Dragon may elect to manipulate the physical form of the patient reshaping bone, moving fat and flesh to create calluses over vital organs and so forth creating organic equipment. It should be noted that this Scale is only capable of creating equipment that could be sensibly crafted/created/altered from flesh and bone or organic material taken from the patient him/herself.%0a%0aLike normal equipment, each +1 bonus may be traded for an equipment tag or special feature and an Exceptional Success adds an additional +1 or an extra tag. Unlike normal equipment, it may not normally be stolen, removed or disarmed as it is a part of the person. By default, these changes are obvious and monstrous, but that can be mitigated by adding Retractable tags. As well, no more than the Nest’s rating in bonuses/tags/rating may be given to the equipment in total. %0a%0aThe Retractable tag renders the augmentation completely undetectable to anything short of supernatural analyses and relevant medical tests analyzing someone’s insides, such as an x-ray detecting altered bones. However, the augment provides no benefit without first being deployed as an Instant action. Deployment lasts until retracted as an Instant Action, but while deployed it is obvious to casual observation.%0a%0aAlthough normally permanent, intensive surgery or supernatural healing can remove the effects of this scale as though it were a number of Aggravated Health Levels equal to the Rating of the Nest the Scale was performed at. %0aDrawback: Using or being subjected to this scale calls into question the person’s relationship to their body and identity as it related to physical form. This calls for a Humanity 4 Breaking Point for both the Dragon and their subject. Non-Kindred subjects suffer an Integrity or Clarity breaking point with a &#8722;3 penalty.%0aThe Dragon must spend a point of Vitae/Essence/ or what supernal energy source he has the ability to tap into. per point of average availability the non-organic equipment would cost.%0a%0aThe Dragon takes a point of LETHAL DMG per point of Equipment meant to be created as the strain of manipulating such energies has a toll on the Dragon as well. Someone may only benefit from one use of this scale per point of Stamina at a time, not counting the removal of Conditions or Tilts.%0a%0aWhenever someone undergoes the use of this Scale an Equipment Request should be sent in to note the equipment on the PCs sheet.%0a%0a[[#to1]]%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25werewolf%25'''Werewolf and Wolf-Blooded'''%25%25%0a%0a----%0a%0a[[#from2]]%0a%0aThe Gift of Cities/Gift of Essence listed here can be taken: [[http://theonyxpath.com/the-giver-of-gifts-2-werewolf-the-forsaken/]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25werewolf%25'''Fetishes/Talens'''%25%25%0a%0a----%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Outsider Fetish (+• Level)''%0a%0a:Effect: Not a Fetish of its own so much as an additional alteration made to an existing Fetish, the Uratha makes it so a Fetish can be activated by those lacking the spiritual attunement that they themselves are inherently gifted with. By raising another Fetish or Talen’s rating by 1, the spirit within is left in a ‘half awake’ state, and can be activated with a special trigger related to its ban, thus allowing non-Uratha (most often, Wolf-Blooded) to make use of it with the normal activation pool. %0a%0aThis power is not needed to activate a Fetish by channeling essence into it, for those capable of doing so another way.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Golden Pill (• Talen)''%0a%0aA medicinal ball, typically about the size of a quarter, which heals all bashing or one Lethal, whichever is more severe.

The ritemaster begins the meal with an anectdote about one or another of the pack, a witty recollection meant to brighten the mood and share the memory with the whole. Each in turn recalls a story of their own, building up the good mood and bringing them together as strong siblings with unbreakable bonds. (Wits+Socialize)%0a%0a:Action: Extended (10 successes; each roll represents half an hour)%0a%0a:Duration: 1 Season, with the option to renew before the duration has elapsed.%0a%0a:Success: The pack may initiate remote communication with one another, on an individual basis, with Resolve + Composure. This communication is limited, granting a general feeling of the packmate’s state of being and direction in which they can be found. Exceptional successes on the initiation provide greater input, a clearer idea of thoughts, as well as an approximate distance to their current location. In moments of extreme emotion, or when in the midst of real combat, this roll can be made reflexively to alert the whole pack, though the individuals would need to succeed on their own roll to have a clear indication of what triggered such an event.%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Gift of Flesh (•••, Pack)''%0a%0a:Private: %0a%0aA pack is one unit, the greater then the sum of it's parts.

But the weakest of the pack sometimes must give their all if the pack is to survive %0a%0a:Symbols: Unity, Sacrifice, Self Harm, Blood, Poison %0a%0a:Sample Rite: The Rite Master decorates themself in symbols of their pack.  The members of the pack gather round the rite master in silent respect as he howls a dirge in first tongue of his willingness to give of himself to strengthen the others.  He takes a specially prepared drink of hemlock and drinks deep from it as the pack howl their respect of the sacrafice and the bond of pack (Persuasion+Expression) %0a%0a:Action: Extended Roll, each Roll Represents 1 minute.

Any additional harm that the individual performing the rite takes onto themselves makes the pack stronger.

During the rite during the rite-mater  moon phase adds a +1 to the roll. To perform this rite the Rite Master must pierce the skin of the subject ( Usually by biting, through other methods may be used). The ritemaster must then draw symbols of protection and the uratha on the subject using a combination of  the subjects and her own blood, doing this creates a supernatural connection between the two (Resolve + Occult).%0a%0a:Success: This rite places a spiritual mark on the subject of the rite marking them being under the protection of a werewolf or pack. Thereafter for the length on one Lunar month any time the recipient of this rite is in danger the ritemaster may spend a willpower to conveniently be in a position to save them. Anyone looking at the subject with a supernatural sense can see/smell/detect the brand, and the combination of scents of the Packs totem and the ritemaster herself.%0a%0aA supernatural connection  to the subject is formed and will warm the werewolf if the subject is in danger, being attacked, or is in danger, allowing the werewolf to try and arrive as quickly as possible (or via the above method).%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Elixir of Life (•••, Pack Rite)''%0a%0a:Symbols: The moon, herbs, blood, healing%0a%0a:Public/Private: Private%0a%0a:Sample Rite: In the light of the moon, the ritualist and participants wound themselves, collecting some blood into a mixture of herbs and ground together. The resulting mixture is daubed onto the chest of each participant with symbols of the moon, health and longevity, while speaking of the virtues of the blood and herbs to reinforce their effectiveness. (Intelligence+Medicine)%0a%0a:Action: Extended (10 successes; each roll represents ten minutes)%0a%0a:Duration: 1 month%0a%0a:Success: Pack members’ blood is strengthened, blessing them with exceptional health and healing, which decreases their healing rate by half. Uratha and others with the means to use Essence, Vitae or other Energy (or even goblin fruit) for regeneration find their healing likewise improved, doubling the effectiveness of using such for healing themselves (one Essence heals two Lethal in a turn, one Blood heals two health, a fruit doubles the healing effect), though this only works outside of combat. To ensure this, the ritemaster must sacrifice enough blood to take one Lethal to empower the rite.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Rite of Healing (•••, Wolf Rite)''%0a%0a:Symbols: Water, The Moon, Breath, and Fire%0a%0a:Public/Private: Public%0a%0a:Sample Rite: Niamh uses water and the mercurial nature of the moon,the warmth of the hearth and the calmness of breath to steady herself and begin to focus on the rite of healing working her knowledge with the beneficial natures of the spirits and the forsaken’s love of luna to help knit together the flesh of those that are wounded.

This spell is technically many different spells, but they all work the same way. Any Knowing or Unveiling spell that, by default, only transmits its knowledge or sensory information to the caster can be used as the basis for this spell, which allows another subject (or subjects) to instead be the recipient (though with increased Scale the Mage may still receive it too).

This ability also allows other vampires to be tracked in a similar fashion to mortals.

Glamour stored within the mage's Pattern remains even after the spell's duration expires; however, she can only hold a number of mana and Glamour equal to her Gnosis derived maximum mana.\\%0a> %0a450,456c447,452%0a%3c !!!%25center%25''Summoning (Fate ••)''%0a%3c %0a%3c :Practice: Ruling%0a%3c :Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c :Withstand: Resolve%0a%3c :Suggested Rote Skills: Investigation, Expression and Persuasion%0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!!Summoning (Fate ••)%0a> '''Practice:''' Ruling\\%0a> '''Primary Factor:''' Duration\\%0a> '''Withstand:''' Resolve\\%0a> '''Suggested Rote Skills:''' Investigation, Expression and Persuasion\\%0a> %0a466,471c462,467%0a%3c !!!%25center%25''Freedom (Fate •••)''%0a%3c %0a%3c :Practice: Perfecting%0a%3c :Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c :Suggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Larceny, Survival%0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!!Freedom (Fate •••)\\%0a> %0a> '''Practice:''' Perfecting\\%0a> '''Primary Factor:''' Duration\\%0a> '''Suggested Rote Skills:''' Athletics, Larceny, Survival\\%0a> %0a474c470%0a%3c '''Add Time 4''': One such escape attempt’s affected dice roll each turn during the spells Duration can be made as a reflexive action, as the mage applies this strain of defiance over time in the blink of an eye. \\%0a---%0a> '''Add Time 4''': One such escape attempt’s affected dice roll each turn during the spells Duration can be made as a reflexive action, as the mage applies this strain of defiance over time in the blink of an eye.\\%0a478,483c474,479%0a%3c !!!%25center%25''Make It Look Easy (Fate •••)''%0a%3c %0a%3c :Practice: Ruling%0a%3c :Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c :Withstand: Composure%0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!!Make It Look Easy (Fate •••)\\%0a> %0a> '''Practice:''' Ruling\\%0a> '''Primary Factor:''' Potency\\%0a> '''Withstand:''' Composure\\%0a> %0a488,493c484,489%0a%3c !!!%25center%25''Unlocking the Secret Garden (Fate •••)''%0a%3c %0a%3c :Practice: Weaving%0a%3c :Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c :Suggested Rote Skills: Crafts, Larceny, Survival%0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!!Unlocking the Secret Garden (Fate •••)\\%0a> %0a> '''Practice:''' Weaving\\%0a> '''Primary Factor:''' Duration\\%0a> '''Suggested Rote Skills:''' Crafts, Larceny, Survival\\%0a> %0a499,504c495,500%0a%3c !!!%25center%25''Baleful Blade (Fate ••••)''%0a%3c %0a%3c :Practice: Patterning%0a%3c :Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c :Suggested Rote Skills: Weaponry, Firearms, Athletics%0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!!Baleful Blade (Fate ••••)\\%0a> %0a> '''Practice:''' Patterning\\%0a> '''Primary Factor:''' Potency\\%0a> '''Suggested Rote Skills:''' Weaponry, Firearms, Athletics\\%0a> %0a509,515c505,511%0a%3c !!!%25center%25''Charmed Life (Fate ••••)''%0a%3c %0a%3c :Practice: Patterning%0a%3c :Primary Factor: Duration %0a%3c :Withstand: Composure (If resisted)%0a%3c :Suggested Rote Skills: Occult, Socialize or Persuasion%0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!!Charmed Life (Fate ••••)\\%0a> %0a> '''Practice''': Patterning\\%0a> '''Primary Factor:''' Duration \\%0a> '''Withstand:''' Composure (If resisted)\\%0a> '''Suggested Rote Skills''': Occult, Socialize or Persuasion\\%0a> %0a521,523c517,518%0a%3c *Downgrade the level of damage by one category against one attack%0a%3c **(Can’t downgrade Aggravated damage unless Reach was spent for this effect)%0a%3c %0a---%0a> *Downgrade the level of damage by one category against one attack (Can’t downgrade Aggravated damage unless Reach was spent for this effect)%0a> %0a528,529c523%0a%3c *Damage from an attack is upgraded one level%0a%3c **(Can’t be upgraded to Aggravated damage unless Reach was spent for this effect)%0a---%0a> *Damage from an attack is upgraded one level (Can’t be upgraded to Aggravated damage unless Reach was spent for this effect)%0a534,543c528,533%0a%3c !!!%25center%25''Skimming the Cream (Fate ••••)''%0a%3c %0a%3c :Practice: Patterning%0a%3c :Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c :Suggested Rote Skills: Academics, Investigation, Subterfuge%0a%3c %0a%3c This spell's effects are as Shifting the Odds (Fate ••, MtA 136), but with less disruption.

It makes the target dead or undead creature act as if its body was still alive. It does not however remove any weaknesses of the body, such as sunlight vulnerability Etc.  The spell will only give the trappings of being alive. The subject will breath, have warm skin, a pulse, and be able to emulate the other basic functions of life, such as eating and drinking food. Corpses will not stink, bloat or otherwise decompose, and appear to be asleep. The subject will register as alive to most mundane senses and objects, and use of supernatural powers to determine the status will cause a Clash of Wills. It will NOT prevent any of the other normal functions, requirements, or weaknesses of the subject. A vampire may eat, but gains no sustenance from the food, and does not heal like a living person. They are still vulnerable to sunlight, and require vitae to function. Conversely, they do not NEED to breath, eat, etc., still being immune to suffocation, starvation (from deprivation from normal food or drink), and still retain their resistance to injury and other factors.%0a

The form serves as armor, as well as a physical form for travel within the Middle and Lower Realms of the Umbra. Astral travelers who wish to perform shapeshifting or other feats in places where they do not have a spiritual body — like Dream Realms — must use a body of light. Also, without such a body, an astral traveler is invisible to those in the physical world, even to those who can sense spirits or magic (Spirit 1, Prime 1).

By finessing a wider web of sources, the mage massages Fate in such a way that no lasting harm is done. The subject specified by the mage may not be the first available, but the greater control of Fate ensures that it's there just as quickly, and with less negative ripples in the fabric of destiny. Objects and currencies drawn by the spell don't cause the previous owner or the mage any inherent or lasting trouble. Retainers injured in temporary service end up receiving sufficient medical care somewhere down the line. Favours garnered by Mentor, Allies, or Contacts slip under the radar or already fit into existing plans.

It's likely a masquerade breach if witnessed by unknowing mortals, and the process doesn't do anything to dull the sensations, often making the experience painful and unsettling; on most mortals (those with Integrity), it's a breaking point if they're not put under some other way. \\%0a%3c '''Outcome:''' Within the Nest (and ONLY within a Wyrm's Nest), the character becomes better able to mold the patient's flesh, stabilizing it to the extent of allowing these stranger methodologies to work on the patient's wounds. \\%0a%3c This allows the Kindred to perform 'intensive care' on the patient within the Nest, without the normal hospital or similar level of equipment needed to do so; a small kit (which can sit within a size 1 container) of special tools and substances will suffice.

Upon activation, however, the bow alights in a chosen element (the options being fire, ice, electricity, and shadow), and upon the string being drawn back, will form an arrow of that element to be fired, for the rest of the scene, doing damage appropriate to the bow’s base stats (chosen from mundane options), but in addition having any additional effect that element might have; fire arrows may cause flammable materials to catch on fire, for instance. %0a> In addition, when already active, the user may reflexively reactive the object to change the element, rather than needing a standard action to do so, allowing for themn to swap easily between the chosen elements in the thick of things. %0a> Action: Standard, reflexive if already active.%0a> Mein: This large looking black bow doesn’t appear to be a real bow for combat, it’s long thin black piece has a thin line for the string. It has an opening in the middle where the arrows are presumably shot from. %0a> Drawback:For 24 hours the user opens themselves to the element; they take 1 extra level of damage from any manifestation of the chosen element, and a &#8722;1 penalty to hindrances caused by it.%0a> Catch:The bow explodes with power, causing it’s wielder damage, the user rolls the weapon rating, (4, in this case), and takes the successes as lethal damage, minimum of 1 lethal. As well, the user takes an environmental tilt for the scene corresponding to the element activated. The damage does not stack with a ‘re-activation’, but the user WILL suffer multiple tilts, in that case.%0a> %0a> The Jurogumo’s Pipe (•••••)%0a245,261c161,170%0a%3c %0a%3c When their own human hair is fired in the bowl, the person inhaling the smoke shares an indirect kiss with the Mistress and finds themselves transformed temproarily into an imitation of her image for a scene.

Some use it with a delicate, barely perceptible touch to nudge people into action while others use a heavy handed approach to puppet someone into whipping a crowd up into a frenzy.

The Contact of the Third Pillar is a ritual which can be used to support and strengthen any supernatural effect performed by another. It is the source of the Court’s strength- where they work together, few can stand against them. If the supernatural power is an instant action, the Contract must be activated before the action is made.%0a%3c %0a%3c Cost%0a%3c 1 Glamour%0a%3c Dice Pool%0a%3c Intelligence + Occult + Wyrd%0a%3c Action%0a%3c Instant or Extended, determined by the primary action’s length.%0a%3c Roll Results%0a%3c Dramatic Failure: The ritual fails spectacularly and the backlash of the Wyrd causes the magic it was supporting to dramatically fail too, which the changeling suffers.%0a%3c Failure: The ritual fails but it does not harm the magic it was supporting.%0a%3c Success: The Third Pillar ritual is a success, and the counts the changeling as a secondary actor in a teamwork roll for a supernatural power whether it is a contract, merit, or other power or ability. Each success rolled + mantle gives the primary actor a bonus die.%0a%3c Exceptional Success: The primary actor is filled with the beauty and Wonder of the Wyrd and the Fortean Court, and receives the Inspired condition.%0a%3c Elemental: Elementals have shed their ego and without it getting in the way have a natural affinity for the ritual. They gain a +3 bonus to their roll.%0a%3c Ogre: Ogres are a pillar of strength in a very physical manner. They may choose the higher of Strength or Intelligence when activating the Contract.%0a%3c Wizened: Wizened who incorporate a mystical tool in their ritual- a hedgespun wand, a Token, or even a Mage’s dedicated tool also imbue the power of the ritual into the tool and gain their successes as a bonus to a single roll when using the tool in another fashion during the scene.%0a%3c Catch%0a%3c Another member of the Fortean Court is the primary actor.%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c Goblin Contracts%0a%3c Centipede’s Delight%0a%3c Public/Private: Public %0a%3c Goblins are not bound to coventional physiology and often have impossible and illogical numbers of appendages, be it hands, legs, fingers, or arms in order to ensnare, exploit, and escape.

The arms may be dismissed at any time before the end of the scene. They receive +3 to all rolls to grapple or utilize upper body strength in Athletics rolls such climbing, swimming, or pulling. %0a%3c Exceptional Success:The Changeling’s arms last the rest of the night, and can be activated as an Instant Action. %0a%3c Catch: The Changeling carries on their person a vial of legs from a creature with more than four legs. %0a%3c Devil’s Own Luck%0a%3c Public/Private: Public%0a%3c What happens when you have a luck obsessed cat bargaining with an eldritch embodiment of the Void?

This cannot provide beats.%0a%3c Exceptional Success: The target gains the Charmed Condition. In addition to the usual effects, the target may resolve the Charmed Condition for 8-again on a mundane roll.%0a%3c Loophole: The target trades good luck for bad, and gains the Shaken Condition. The target cannot resolve the Charmed Condition, nor can the changeling use this Contract again, until this Shaken Condition is resolved.%0a%3c %0a%3c Tokens%0a%3c Cat’s Eye Pendant (•)%0a%3c Public/Private: Public%0a%3c Abilities: A rare gemstone that’s actually only recently been discovered in the past century, Alexandrite has nevertheless become the source of much speculation and story telling, believing that carrying a piece of cat’s eyes will bestow a measure of the luck and health of the feline race upon the wearer. The Cat’s Eye is a piece of jewelry, set with a stunning amber alexandrite with chatoyancy, creating a cat’s eye effect. Exposure of the gemstone to the wild magic of the fae brings a measure of the story to the gemstones, bringing a measure of feline to the gem, and to the wearer. %0a%3c Those who wear the adornment can use Animal Ken in place of Athletics, transforming one’s affinity for cats into physical manifestation, moving a bit more like a cat than a human. With ST approval, this can also apply to an Expression roll while dancing. This does not apply to magic power invocations, nor for any xp purchase prerequisites. To use the cat’s eye, the wearer simply has to openly display the gemstone on their person - if covered (such as by clothing) or the gem removed from the setting, the token cannot be used or, if active, ceases to function. The gemstone must be worn as part of a jewelry piece, and can be transferred to new settings and trinkets without ruining its magic. %0a%3c There is a small ritual involved to activate the gemstone, primarily taking a bit of time to put it on, making sure it lays right, and then brushing a hand over the stone itself last (taking at least two Instant Actions, making it nonviable during combat). The token remains active as long as the ornament is worn (for purposes of Clash of Wills, this counts as a year). Once removed, it must be activated again through the accompanying ritual.%0a%3c Action: Instant%0a%3c Mein: When active, the Eye actually blinks and looks around, the chatoyancy shifting as it observes the surroundings. The iris gains depth and appears alive, the pupil expands and contracts with lighting, though no sclera is present. Drawback: Using human tools suffers an untrained penalty to use (&#8722;1 if using a physical or social skill, &#8722;3 if using a mental skill). In short, the effect of the cat’s eye makes it more difficult to use objects primarily intended for humans; objects or equipment that can apply to animals can be used without penalty. %0a%3c Catch: The wearer can activate the token without a roll or glamour by simply walking around on all fours. However, the human body is not built to act on all fours, leading to developing pained muscles. Each use inflicts a cumulative &#8722;2 penalty to any action after use, as if a wound penalty. This cannot be offset by any merit or ability. The penalty is reduced by 1 per night’s rest.%0a%3c Elemental Bow (••••)%0a%3c Public/Private: Public%0a%3c Abilities:The Elemental Bow is a large, ornate looking bow that’s often carried without any apparent ammunition, unless of course one plans to use it among mundane audiences. Upon activation, however, the bow alights in a chosen element (the options being fire, ice, electricity, and shadow), and upon the string being drawn back, will form an arrow of that element to be fired, for the rest of the scene, doing damage appropriate to the bow’s base stats (chosen from mundane options), but in addition having any additional effect that element might have; fire arrows may cause flammable materials to catch on fire, for instance. %0a%3c In addition, when already active, the user may reflexively reactive the object to change the element, rather than needing a standard action to do so, allowing for themn to swap easily between the chosen elements in the thick of things. %0a%3c Action: Standard, reflexive if already active.%0a%3c Mein: This large looking black bow doesn’t appear to be a real bow for combat, it’s long thin black piece has a thin line for the string. It has an opening in the middle where the arrows are presumably shot from. %0a%3c Drawback:For 24 hours the user opens themselves to the element; they take 1 extra level of damage from any manifestation of the chosen element, and a &#8722;1 penalty to hindrances caused by it.%0a%3c Catch:The bow explodes with power, causing it’s wielder damage, the user rolls the weapon rating, (4, in this case), and takes the successes as lethal damage, minimum of 1 lethal. As well, the user takes an environmental tilt for the scene corresponding to the element activated. The damage does not stack with a ‘re-activation’, but the user WILL suffer multiple tilts, in that case.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Jurogumo’s Pipe (•••••)%0a%3c The Jurogumo’s Pipe takes the form of a finely made Japanese style kiseru, a long and thin tobacco smoking pipe the length of a human forearm. This kiseru belongs to Vrys’s True Fae Keeper, The Jorogumo, Entangling Mistress of Black Waters. The Pipe is one of many others which have been carelessly lost among the Thorns of the Hedge on from the Mistress’ jaunts out of her Realm. This Token has a small bowl for burning finely shredded tobbacco and a long shaft to a mouthpiece for inhalation with bulging tips at either end.%0a%3c When their own human hair is fired in the bowl, the person inhaling the smoke shares an indirect kiss with the Mistress and finds themselves transformed temproarily into an imitation of her image for a scene: they gain +2 Size, 2/2 Armor, and +3 Lethal to their Unarmed attacks as their lower bodies morph into a scuttling arachnid nightmare.%0a%3c Action: Instant%0a%3c Mien: The Pipe made from the chitin of spiders and the bone of drowned men fired in hot coals under a new moon’s light. When smoked, the soft caress of the Mistress’ fingers can be felt and her breath in%0a%3c Drawback: The transformation wreaks havok upon the sense of Self and constitutes a Breaking Point whenever used as both beastly mind and human reason clash together. Additionally, the user takes on Condition: Obsession in the same vein of the licentious Jorogumo and shall suffer one aggravated damage at dawn per night that they do not seduce a stranger into an intimate moment. This may range from a stolen kiss to intercourse, but the token user must seduce a number of different individuals equal to their Wyrd to lift the compulsion. %0a%3c Catch: If the token user opts not to pay the glamour for activating then the Jurogumo sends a few emissaries of her own to extract her price. The user finds themselves accosted by illusory spiders wherever they go from dawn to dusk, hallucinating visions of black water and entangling webs of hair and silk dragging them beneath. These hallucinations can inflict lethal damage upon the user who must evade them without rest or until suffering their Wyrd in lethal damage from asphyxiating in water.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Mage%0a%3c Death Spells%0a%3c Life Conversions%0a%3c The following Life spells can be assumed to have Death-based equivalents at the same level that affect Vampires (and other non-ephemeral, physical undead):%0a%3c %0a%3c Mutable Mask (Life 2)%0a%3c Degrading the Form (Life 3) (Note: This specific mirror works even on living targets)%0a%3c Honing the Form (Life 3)%0a%3c Knit (Life 3)%0a%3c Many Faces (Life 3)%0a%3c Transform Life (Life 3) requires both Death 3 and Life 3%0a%3c Animal Minion (Life 4)%0a%3c Mend (Life 4)%0a%3c Regeneration (Life 4)%0a%3c Shapechanging (Life 4) requires both Death 4 and Life 4%0a%3c Spirit Conversions%0a%3c The following Spirit spells can be assumed to have Death-based equivalents at the same level that affect Ghosts and similar Death-related ephemeral entities instead of Spirits:%0a%3c %0a%3c Invoke Bane (Spirit 1)%0a%3c Know Spirit (Spirit 1)%0a%3c Command Spirit (Spirit 2)%0a%3c Shadow Walk (Spirit 2)%0a%3c Craft Fetish (Spirit 4)%0a%3c Shape Spirit (Spirit 4)%0a%3c Annihilate Spirit (Spirit 5)%0a%3c Shadow Sight (Death •)%0a%3c Practice: Unveiling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Investigation, Occult, Survival%0a%3c For the duration of the spell, the Mage is capable of seeing the true form of shadows, seeing their boundaries, size, shape, and everything else about them. This essentially allows the Mage to see in any amount of darkness, though if no light at all is available, he’ll only see in varying shades of textureless blackness. By default this spell only reveals mundane darkness to the user’s senses.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The sense extends to the supernatural; anything supernaturally concealed that’s covered with shadows or darkness can still be perceived by the Mage if he wins the ensuing Clash of Wills. This will also outline ‘sentient’ creatures of darkness as separate from other shadows, including mages using Shadow Flesh, or creatures from various shadowy realms….%0a%3c %0a%3c Invite the Grave (Death •••)%0a%3c Practice: Perfecting%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Stamina%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Medicine, Science, Intimidation%0a%3c This spell enhances the course of Entropy, making those that suffer from it feel the effects that much more intensely. The next time the subject suffers at least a point of damage over the Duration, increase the damage suffered by this spell’s Potency; the damage is the same type as that originally suffered. This can affect a maximum number of damaging effects equal to the spell’s Potency.%0a%3c %0a%3c Nights Grasp (Death •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Cost: 1 Mana%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Occult, Academics, Science%0a%3c Night’s Grasp enables the caster to form starry black tendrils from the very shadows themselves. These tendrils can strike, grapple, hinder, and restrict under the command of their creator acting as the mages inpromtu defender until the spell is dropped. %0a%3c One tendril is created per target factor; these tendrils have a brawl dice pool equal to the spell’s Potency, no defense, and health equal to the caster’s Death rating. The tendrils act on the Mage’s initiative, but being mindless, do not perform acts on their own; one tendril per turn may be given a simple command (attack X, defend Y) reflexively by the caster, or an instant action may be used to give them all the same command. They will continue to attempt the action until it can’t be done anymore or a new command is given (or the spell ends, of course).%0a%3c +1 Reach: The caster’s Brawl rating is added to the tendrils’ dice pool.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The tendrils can affect Death-aspected Twilight.%0a%3c %0a%3c Open Avernian Gateway (Death •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Intimidation, Occult %0a%3c This spell targets an Avernian Gateway, opening it for the duration and allowing anyone (from either side) to travel through it until it closes again; this applies the Underworld Gate condition to the area. Any attempt to close the gateway before the spell ends provokes a Clash of Wills.%0a%3c +2 Reach: The Gateway only opens in one direction, allowing the Mage to travel through it into the Underworld without allowing ghosts out, for instance.%0a%3c %0a%3c Suppress Decay (Death •••)%0a%3c Practice: Fraying%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Medicine, Athletics, Survival%0a%3c The mage is capable of stifling entropic energy, causing wounds and other injuries to be rendered superficial and harmless. For the duration, 2 points of pre-existing bashing damage per point of Potency can be ignored by the subject, as if they were undamaged. The underlying wound will heal at about twice the normal speed during this time, as well, since the body needn’t deal with the actual ‘harm’ itself. If the duration ends before the wound heals, the damage for any unhealed wounds reappears (accounting for the increased healing speed).%0a%3c This will also prevent bleeding out and other injuries that worsen over time for the duration.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The spell can suppress one pre-existing lethal damage per Potency instead of 2 bashing.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The mage may suppress a pre-existing Personal Tilt caused by Damage, such as Arm Wrack, causing the damage to become entirely superficial (if disturbing).%0a%3c +2 Reach: The effect is Lasting (but the superficial wounds still take time to heal)%0a%3c Advanced Shadow Crafting (Death ••••)%0a%3c Practice: Unraveling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Academics, Intimidation, Occult%0a%3c While a weaker version of this spell exists that crafts items from shadows and solidifies them for use by the mage, this more potent spell creates weapons and items that inflict weakness on opponents using the disabling nature of the Underworld towards the living. Indeed, these are not merely shadows, the shadows used in this spell are forged from death and have a devastating affect of living flesh, and their potent shadow-forged weapons strike not only the flesh of corpses and dead creatures, but affect their very being. The maximum durability, damage rating, and equipment bonus from objects crafted from shadow increases to match the rating in the casters Death Arcana. Additionally, attacks from these weapons deal lethal damage, even to Undead and Ephemeral beings (related to the Death aspect of Twilight) that normally downgrade such damage.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The shadows are potent manifestations of the decay of death, and successful attacks inflict the Sick (Grave) tilt while in combat on living targets.%0a%3c +2 Reach and 1 Mana: The weapon does Aggravated damage as it not only attacks the body, rotting away flesh and decaying bone, but it damages the very essence of the creature as well. This deals aggravated damage against creatures that normally downgrade most forms of damage, including Vampires and ephemeral beings. While this reach is in effect, any weapon forged by the shadows is considered a 0A weapon.%0a%3c %0a%3c Forbid Injury (Death ••••)%0a%3c Practice: Unraveling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Medicine, Athletics, Survival%0a%3c An Adept of Death is capable of not only stifling injury, but making even the most egregious wounds incapable of actually harming one’s life force, stripping away the actual danger present in any form of injury. Each level of potency causes 2 pre-existing lethal damage (i.e that were there upon casting) to be ignored by the subject, as if not present at all, although the superficial wounds remain, and become dangerous again after the duration ends. However, the underlying injury heals at twice the speed for the duration, as there’s no true harm for the body to struggle against. %0a%3c This will also prevent bleeding out and other injuries that worsen over time for the duration.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The spell can suppress pre-existing aggravated damage. Cost: 1 mana%0a%3c +1 Reach: The subject may dedicate a Potency to ignore a single pre-existing physical tilt for the duration, rendering any injury or impedance entirely superficial, barring actual removal of an appendage or other body part.%0a%3c +2 Reach: The effect is Lasting (but the superficial wounds still take time to heal).%0a%3c Fate Spells%0a%3c Between the Lines (Fate •/Prime •)%0a%3c Practice: Knowing%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Academics, Occult, Expression%0a%3c This spell reveals key information about the form and intent of symbols, whether these are cultural (e.g. art, status items), lingual (e.g. hobo-signs, alien glyphs), or magical (wards, curses, etc.) As examples, the subject may interpret a painting as reflective of melancholy over social issues, a ring or scar as denoting accomplishment or status in a public or secret society, a series of hobo-signs marking a dangerous passage, or arcane symbols as denoting intent to warn, curse, harm, disease, seal, or summon.%0a%3c The spell offers no information about the creator, the symbol’s origins, or the symbol/item’s veracity (e.g. if a piece is fake or truly gilded). Furthermore, the spell offers no information about follow-through: threatening symbols are no guarantee of violence, nor is a sealing symbol proof of supernatural power and/or its success — only its intent to seal. The spell reveals, exclusively, information about the intent of the symbol itself.%0a%3c +1 Reach: Short visions inform the Mage about the symbol’s origins, adding Potency to rolls involving the interpretation or study of symbols.%0a%3c +2 Reach: Spend a point of Mana. The Mage can cast this spell as a Reflexive action.%0a%3c %0a%3c Counting the Magic Beans (Fate •)%0a%3c Practice: Knowing%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Withstand: None%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Empathy, Streetwise, Survival%0a%3c By tapping into the web of narrative-as-Destiny told by the Hedge, the mage becomes keenly aware of the characters and plants native to the Hedge nearby. She feels the gravity of their narrative as it tries to draw the Mage in to their tropes. Most mages specify certain types of characters to detect, such as “Hobs and Goblin Fruit,” or “only Huntsmen.”%0a%3c After successfully casting this spell, the mage can detect all the specified types of characters within the spell’s area Scale, or that enter the spell’s area while it remains in effect. The Mage also knows what the characters are under the Mask, if applicable. The Hedge’s thorns are uniquely immune to being processed by this spell.%0a%3c Add Mind 1: The mage can detect the presence of Oneiroi, Baubles, Cobblethought, and Dreamspun items.%0a%3c Reach +1: The Mage can detect things transformed by the Hedge, such as Hedgebeasts and Changelings.%0a%3c Reach +1: The Mage can specify characters by their role or function so long as it has been made an intrinsic part of their nature, allowing the Mage to specifically look for “Goblin Merchants” or “Poisonous Goblin Fruit.” When combined with the above Reach, the Mage can look for Changelings with specific Kiths (but not Seemings, as the Hedge is not responsible for that transformation).%0a%3c Find the Path (Fate •)%0a%3c Practice: Knowing%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Withstand: None%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Academics, Occult, Survival%0a%3c This spell can detects the presence and location of Irises leading to or from the Hedge in the area of effect of the spell’s Scale. Add this spell’s Potency to rolls made by the subject to navigate to it.%0a%3c Reach +1: The subject becomes aware of one type of topographical feature within the Hedge in addition to any Iris’s, such as (but not limited to) Trods and Hollows. By adding Mind 1, this may include Dream Bastions. This Reach may be selected multiple times.%0a%3c Supernal Targeting (Fate •, Time •, Space •)%0a%3c Practice: Knowing%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Firearms, Athletics, Investigation%0a%3c A mixture of knowing how the next fleeting moments will affect a subjects target’s position, intimacy with the correlation between objects spacially, and a preternatural sense of timing are molded together to allow a mage to begin preparing his actions for efficiency, well before conventional precepts with eerie fluidity. This spell makes aiming a thrown or fired weapon take less time. In lieu of spending a turn aiming, the aim action’s use-time is reduced to an Instant Action. In most cases, this allows a Mage to aim and move. Also, as long as the Mage does not change the target(s) of this accuracy, attacks do not reset the bonus received from aiming. If the target of the aim action moves outside of the Mage’s line of sight, the aim is disrupted normally. Sleeper Witnesses suffer Quiescence normally.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The spells affected aim actions are made reflexively, though this does not allow for multiple aim actions to be taken in one turn.%0a%3c %0a%3c Summoning (Fate ••)%0a%3c Practice: Ruling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Withstand: Resolve%0a%3c Cost: None%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Investigation, Expression and Persuasion%0a%3c Fated things and people are pulled together as if by gravity and with this spell the mage compells that law of Fate summoning to her side lost things and people.%0a%3c The mage cast this spell on her target then at anytime during it’s duration she may sense how to reach her target. She doesn’t know the whole route to take just what steps to take to find them but she does have a general sense in what direction her target lies. She may invoke this ability a number of times equal to the spells Potency.%0a%3c If the Object or Person is within the immediate area the target becomes apparent in someway to the caster, perhaps a soft wind blows making it rattle or a streetlight turns on highlighting it. If the optional Reach effect is taken instead the person or object makes it’s way back to the mage. Typically this takes up to 24 hours if the target is in the same city but could take longer for longer distances.%0a%3c People that are being summoned have the impression their being called by the caster and have a rough idea how to find the caster but nothing concrete. Events will conspire to lead and harass the target to come to the caster of this spell. If they actively resist this spell’s call they suffer a Hex equal to this spell’s potency so long as they continue to ignore the calling (in such a case, they find it difficult to stay away, but not impossible).%0a%3c +2 Reach: The target makes its way back to the caster, as described.%0a%3c +3 Reach: As above but the target hurries back in half the normal time (if not resisting the call).%0a%3c %0a%3c Freedom (Fate •••)%0a%3c Practice: Perfecting%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Larceny, Survival%0a%3c Using this spell, the mage’s potential is safeguarded against the mundane meddling of those seeking to control her using a more mundane methodology. Hands slip free, keys are dropped and bounce just barely into reach, the cuffs failed to lock tight enough, or the chair the mage is tied to finally decides to break after it’s years of service are through, leaving the subject surrounded with a means to cut her loosened bonds. Efforts to grapple the subject of the spell are reduced to a chance die, regardless of how easily achieved the grapple was established, though the subject suffers similar effects regarding her ability to ensnare subjects as well. Mundane binding of any form, on their own, fail automatically, and Supernatural effects that employ physical means of trapping the subject provoke a Clash of Wills (up to Potency times). This spell fails if the subject is unconscious or otherwise unable to take action%0a%3c +1 Reach: The effect only works one way, the subject(s) of the magic being able to bind and tie their own targets are unrestricted by the magic, but the target’s own rolls are not penalized to resist these attempts (such as when doing any maneuver other than Breaking Free in a grapple).%0a%3c Add Time 4: One such escape attempt’s affected dice roll each turn during the spells Duration can be made as a reflexive action, as the mage applies this strain of defiance over time in the blink of an eye.%0a%3c %0a%3c Make It Look Easy (Fate •••)%0a%3c Practice: Ruling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Composure%0a%3c The subjects exceptional success threshold for mundane rolls are expanded or reduced by the spell’s Potency during the spell’s Duration (to a minimum of 1), up to a number of times equal to Potency. This spell has no control over whether or not success is actually achieved, what it does is increase or decrease the forceful effects of success, so that even meager efforts can make for a higher grade of results, or mighty efforts met with modest effects. This spell can make capable experts appear to be talented charlatans, or make up amateur taxi drivers to seem like trained Hollywood stunt devils.%0a%3c +2 Reach: The spell affects spell-casting rolls and supernatural powers, but may not reduce the threshold below 3, no matter the potency.%0a%3c %0a%3c Unlocking the Secret Garden (Fate •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Withstand: None%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Crafts, Larceny, Survival%0a%3c This spell allows the Mage to force an Iris leading into or out of the Hedge open or closed, regardless of its associated keys. This may require a Clash of Wills in the case of Gateways being kept open or closed by another being.%0a%3c Reach +1: The Mage may instead change one detail of the Gate’s Key or means of access per Potency. A gate that opens to red headed stepchildren that spin around backwards three times might be changed to opening for anyone, that claps their hands three times for two Potency.%0a%3c Baleful Blade (Fate 4)%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Weaponry, Firearms, Athletics%0a%3c Sometimes the knife needs a little push to find its mark, to hit those soft points and nerves, to punch between the ribs. A bat needs the oh-so slightest perfection in the swing to knock a collar bone in half, and a bullet needs that extra centimeter to the left to pierce the heart. With this spell an acanthus can urge the strings of fate to tug it in the right direction, making even the smallest pen knife an instrument of doom for its victim. The target of this spell has its weapon rating increased by +1 per potency.%0a%3c +1 reach: The weapon also gains Armor Piercing equal to the spell’s potency.%0a%3c %0a%3c Charmed Life (Fate ••••)%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration %0a%3c ‘Withstand: Composure if resisted%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Occult, Socialize or Persuasion%0a%3c The subject of the spells enjoys or endures a life of extremes. A blessed life does away with minor inconvienances such as too many red lights or stubbed toes. They can also be blessed in the following ways to a maximum number of times equal to the spell’s potency. Each use is reflexive and can only be used once per turn, and not th esame turn as the same condition was expended or resolved.%0a%3c %0a%3c Gain the Charmed Condition%0a%3c Gain the Steadfast Condition%0a%3c Gain the Resolute Condition%0a%3c Downgrade the level of damage by one category against one attack (Can’t downgrade Aggravated damage unless Reach was spent for this effect)%0a%3c Meanwhile a cursed subject suffers indignities at every turn, spilled coffee to running late to work. For each potency of the spell the subject suffers one of the following effects whenever it’s dramatically appropriate as determined by the Storyteller. As a charmed individual above an effect from this spell can only occur once per turn and is reflexive.%0a%3c %0a%3c An exceptional success becomes a normal success%0a%3c A failure becomes a dramatic failure%0a%3c Damage from an attack is upgraded one level (Can’t be upgraded to Aggravated damage unless Reach was spent for this effect)%0a%3c Apply a negative condition or Tilt appropriate to the situation%0a%3c +1 Reach: The spell can downgrade or upgrade damage from/to Aggravated%0a%3c %0a%3c What If Scenario (Fate ••••/Time •)%0a%3c Practice: Patterning %0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: (Occult; Science, academics)%0a%3c The mage can look into a subject’s possible future and see what could be if certain strings of fate were manipulated. This allows the mage to divine where altering the fabric of fate may affect the future, or potentially seeing what the outcome of a particular destiny may be. Without reach, the mage can only dvine the effects of their own fate and changes they might make. This spell can see far into the future, allowing the mage to see most likely long-term consequences of their current fate. The mage may incorporate as many possible shifts to their fate as potency. Looking too far from the present increases the likelihood of the answer being superseded by the point the future becomes the present. The Storyteller must decide what the future holds, taking into account the nature of the story as well as cues from the mage’s description of the “what if scenario.”%0a%3c While viewing the possible future, the mage loses all Defense and may not take any actions or cast further spells. %0a%3c +1 Reach: The mage can specify fates external to their own in the What If Scenario.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The mage can specify a specific date and time in the future to perceive the results of the What If scenario at that time.%0a%3c Forces Spells%0a%3c Matter Conversions%0a%3c The following spells from Matter can be used with equivalent Forces on/relating to electronic/computerized devices.%0a%3c %0a%3c Machine Invisibility%0a%3c Discovery Protocol (Forces •)%0a%3c Practice: Knowing%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Computer, Intimidate, Larceny%0a%3c Modern technology still requires a known piece of information to ask a question of a machine. The awakened Discovery Protocol circumvents this necessity of known information to extract information that is available for request by the nature of the system. This spell extracts a hybrid DHCP-ARP cache from an active system. A table of this type acts as a symbolic sympathetic yantra to each device on it, and Representational to the device from which it was extracted.%0a%3c +1 Reach: Rather than a copy of existing data, the device produces a brand new, specialized table, increasing the primary device’s sympathetic strength from the table to material (though this fades to representational after a month, as normal).%0a%3c +1 Reach: By providing the faintest spark of power, an unpowered device becomes a valid target.%0a%3c Add Spirit 1: A spiritual resident or representation of a system becomes a valid target, providing its sympathetic name as well. A spirit may withstand with its Rank.%0a%3c %0a%3c Magnetometer (Forces •)%0a%3c Practice: Unveiling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Science, Academics, Subterfuge%0a%3c The subject is able to sense metal and magnetic materials, including the size and location of the object; similar to a magnetometer at security checkpoints, but with more precision.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The target knows the shape of the object or objects detected.%0a%3c %0a%3c Programmer’s eye (Forces •)%0a%3c Practice: Knowing%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Computer, Investigation, Science%0a%3c Under the programmer’s eye, all code remains mysterious until it unfolds, sloppy notations, personal quirks run rampant through the system. However, by undergoing a moment of epiphany under this effect, the subject gains a complete understanding of the software or the data. It’s intended purpose is obvious and available; as is its absence. Corruption, Encryption, and Mistakes that interferes with normal operations are also revealed, but not immediately understood and must be corrected through other means.%0a%3c +1 Reach: Understanding the function of the examined code grants the subject 8-again on all actions using the studied code. Only the most recently studied object gains this benefit as the supernal clarity fades from the mind’s eye to replace it with another.%0a%3c +2 Reach: As above, plus the spell reveals all potential uses of an object, fanned out in a vast array of Supernal symbols around the object. Focusing on a particular use might require a reflexive Wits + Composure roll for especially complex items.%0a%3c Add Fate •: The mage names a particular task when casting the spell (e.g. “get leverage on Carruthers,” “translate the Codex Afire”). Any data that might help with that task seem to loom larger, to be more digitally present, and are immediately obvious to the subject as soon as she lays eyes on them.%0a%3c %0a%3c Run Software (Forces •)%0a%3c Practice: Compelling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Computer, Drive, Expression%0a%3c Computers have only begun to scratch the surface of their potential and as man reaches their imagination extends towards a new step that could not have been considered before that moment. Running a program within a computer system is among the simplest of digital magics available to those who delve into this type of magic. The affected program simply responds as the mage wishes. Any action requiring a skill roll treats the spell’s Potency as its successes.%0a%3c +1 Reach: Scripts can be set for automation, performing their task when some value is met, however it must be within the confines of what a computer understands. This is most often its time clock.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The caster can perform more complex tasks while controlling the object, including extended actions or maintaining continuous control of the object as long as the spell’s Duration lasts.%0a%3c %0a%3c Aethernet (Forces ••, Space ••)%0a%3c Practice: Ruling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Computer, Larceny, Persuasion%0a%3c Free WiFi is never truly free. It comes with its own risks and rewards and it is still, even today, not quite ubiquitous. Opening an ‘Aethernet’ connection allows a device which generates a signal (cellphone antenna, wifi adapter, RJ-45) to broadcast to a device which generates a similar signal (cell tower, wifi enabled router, ethernet cable) and receive those signals remotely using the natural sympathy of their wavelengths which is hardcoded to reality and the natural propensity for devices of these types to communicate.%0a%3c Add Death ••, Sprit ••, etc: By adding •• in an Arcanum whose purview includes another realm of existence (e.g. the Underworld or the Shadow), the mage may transmit data from that realm into the physical world, or vice versa.%0a%3c Add Time ••: By asserting that today is still yesterday, the character may access information that existed prior to entering an other worldly realm. This is most useful for accessing (deleted) digital libraries and not so much for email or news feeds.%0a%3c %0a%3c Inhibit Ignition (Forces ••)%0a%3c Practice: Ruling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Crafts, Science, Occult%0a%3c With this effect, the mage inhibits fire’s ability to spread to or to ignite new substances within it’s area of effect. While it will not extinguish existing flames, such a fire will die out naturally when its existing fuel is expended and it is unable to spread. %0a%3c More importantly, however, no new sources of ignition will work within the area. Matches or lighters will not light, nor will fuses. Explosives or their primers will not ignite, preventing bombs or grenades from exploding, and even bullets will not fire (note though, that projectiles NOT propelled by explosives will still work, for example Airsoft or CO2 guns). Vehicles operated by internal combustion engines will not run (but electric vehicles will!). %0a%3c If the source of fire or combustion is magical or supernatural in nature, this will provoke a Clash of Wills. %0a%3c %0a%3c Merciful Blow (Forces ••)%0a%3c Practice: Ruling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Brawl, Science%0a%3c Useful for both training purposes and for those who wish to subdue an opponent without causing permanent damage, the mage diffuses the force of his armed or hand to hand strikes, changing any lethal damage caused, into bashing. As usual, excessive bashing damage may roll over into lethal. This spell has no effect on INCOMING blows, only ones made by the mage himself.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The spell applies the Knocked Down Tilt%0a%3c +1 Reach: The spell applies the Stunned Tilt%0a%3c +2 Reach: The spell may be applied to thrown weapons. Alternately, it may be applied to Firearms, however they also automatically lose any Armor Piercing rating.%0a%3c Overclock (Forces ••)%0a%3c Practice: Ruling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Computer, Persuasion, Science%0a%3c Amplify the power, refine the language, complete the circuit; through subtle changes in the system, the target electronic device becomes increasingly receptive to the user’s input. The grants its user the 9-Again quality for the duration of the spell, so long as it’s a tool that can benefit from an increase in processing power.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The tool grants the 8-Again quality instead.%0a%3c %0a%3c Reroute (Forces ••)%0a%3c Practice: Ruling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Computer, Larceny, Subterfuge%0a%3c Data flows constantly, and with the correct nudge it can be made to flow to places other than its originally intended destination, as the case may be, packets will universally be resent to fill the void that was left when the receiving end fails to find the correct piece. A bank account number, the latest torrent streams, it all becomes accessible while in motion. Texts and emails are especially of great value as the cases may be. Only a single type of data may be affected.%0a%3c Alternatively, the mage can repel certain forms of data from a subject in a similar fashion; not getting that call, that text, that email can greatly disrupt normal business operations.%0a%3c +1 Reach: Additional types of data may be compelled to or from a subject, per level of reach.%0a%3c %0a%3c Flash Freeze (Forces •••)%0a%3c Practice: Fraying%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Intimidation, Occult, Survival%0a%3c The mage frays the heat of a subject, suddenly and dramatically dropping its temperature as though exposed to a snowy winter night. The effects of this vary by subject and circumstance. For example, most liquids and vapours condense/freeze, and most solid substances become brittle (ignore 1 Durability while frozen). If used on a living being, the spell causes Bashing damage equal to Potency for those incapable; if the spell is cast with sufficient Duration on a being capable of hibernation, it may be induced with this spell instead of damage.%0a%3c Note that this spell may cause further effects based on the being frozen, or being subjected to local temperature differences when the spell ends: sudden freezing may cause containers to burst, heated ice may crack, and condensed/frozen vapors may evaporate in high concentrations.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The sudden chill is enough to cause Bashing damage to all subjects. Those already susceptible to Bashing damage from the spell suffer a penalty to their Athletics equal to the spell’s Potency.%0a%3c %0a%3c In for a Shock (Forces 3, Life 3)%0a%3c Practice: Fraying%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Medicine, Science, Brawl%0a%3c With a touch, the Mage can harness and amplify the natural electrical impulses to create an electric shock within the subject. The subject takes the spell’s Potency in bashing damage as nerves misfire and electrical impulses are interrupted.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The sudden jolt causes the Stunned tilt due to its intensity.%0a%3c +1 Reach: Electrical devices in the target (Such as pacemakers) or touching the target’s skin also take the damage, bypassing Durability.%0a%3c %0a%3c Recompile Software (Forces •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Computer, Drive, Streetwise%0a%3c From 01000001 to 01011010, the digital sea ebbs and flows with software as it runs and performs its operations. Grasping deep within this network fueled by the genius of Tesla and Edison, born of Babbage and Turing, the mage may grasp and seize the children of Lovelace, forming them into new shapes to suit an immediate need. The Imago takes this need and realigns the 1s and 0s until they form the function that is required in that instant. What is a program: The chatbot, the firewall, the personal assistant. The MMO, the conversation, the Dialogue, the circle spins endless and takes limitless shapes. Humanity has yet to find the limit of what its software is capable of becoming. %0a%3c The potency of this effect reshapes the software, acting as successes to skill rolls performed by the software, if applicable. Each piece of software can only serve a single function, whether it be searching the internet, driving a car, or targetting an orbital strike.%0a%3c To code the software to the appropriate form, the mage must have an understanding of the code to be created, requiring a successful Intelligence + Computer check, penalized by the complexity of the new software. The ‘new’ software must still be operated by the user, which can be intensely frustrating when it no longer serves its original purpose.%0a%3c +1 Reach: Scripts can be set for automation, performing their task when some value is met, however it must be within the confines of what a computer understands. This is most often its time clock.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The caster can perform more complex tasks while controlling the object, including extended actions or maintaining continuous control of the object as long as the spell’s Duration lasts.%0a%3c %0a%3c Heat Shield (Forces •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested rote skills: Athletics, Occult, Science%0a%3c The mage redirects electrons, letting heat and electricity pass harmlessly around her. This spell acts as a shield against direct damage from fire and electricity, granting effective armour equal to the caster’s Forces Arcanum. It cannot stack with other sources of magical shields or armour. Mage Armour explicitly suppresses this spell when active, even if the protection should be less than the effect it replaces. Magical sources of harm trigger a Clash of Wills, and the spell can Clash as many times as the spell’s Potency. %0a%3c +1 Reach: Instead of the energy being harmlessly scattered, any damage prevented by the spell can be redirected to adjacent targets. Any targets within two meters not protected by this spell, including any attackers and the mage’s surroundings, suffer half the absorbed damage as bashing damage.%0a%3c %0a%3c Roll With It (Forces •••)%0a%3c Practice: Perfecting%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Cost: 1 Mana%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Science, Brawl%0a%3c The subject gains a superlative understanding of the application of kinetic force and leverage. The subject knows how to move to dissipate and redirect the energy from physical blows to reduce damage - possibly even avoiding what would otherwise be a solid strike, potentially setting up a counter-attack. This spell grants the subject’s attempt to dodge physical attacks, including attempts to grapple, the rote quality. The subject’s player can choose which of his rolls are affected (declared before the dice are rolled). This is used a number of rolls equal to potency while the spell duration is active. The subject of the spell is still subject to other dodge restrictions. %0a%3c +1 Reach: This spell applies to attempts to escape a grapple.%0a%3c +1 Reach, Add Time 1: The character may attempt to dodge bullets and similar attacks.%0a%3c %0a%3c Sound of Creation (Forces •••)%0a%3c Practices: Perfecting%0a%3c Primary factor: Potency%0a%3c Cost: 1 mana%0a%3c Suggested rote skills: Expression, Occult, Science%0a%3c Any action that has sound quality as a key component (i.e. musical performances) is heightened to magical perfection and acquires the rote quality. The subject gains the quality for a number of appropriate mundane rolls equal to Potency. While Forces are not commonly thought of as the source of inspiration, sonic energy holds mystical sway over living beings, and a master of this spell can use it to draw the perfected power of the Aether and use it to fuel and enhance her own gifts to exploit its many secrets.%0a%3c %0a%3c Compile Sprite (Forces ••••)%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Composure or Rank%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Computer, Expression, Occult%0a%3c Singularity. The Ghost in the Machine. SkyNet. Titan and Promethean. Replicants. Artificial Intelligence. We are software operating in the medium of a machine sculpted from a billion years of evolution and we now seek to create that which is ourselves within the digital medium, cause and effect, a summation of experiences, the methods go on for shaping these nascent disembodied beings though we inevitably seek to embody them that they might live among us in our world. Each level of Potency effectively grants a dot of the Retainer merit. The Sprite’s “Field” is defined at the time of its compilation, and must make sense for an AI in the system it’s implanted.%0a%3c Add Death ••••, Mind ••••, or Spirit ••••: Binds a ghost, goetia, or spirit into the Sprite, which allows it to act as a vessel for that entity. The sprite still uses the Retainer dots to determine dice pools, but it can use any of the possessing entity’s powers, and the sprite’s “field” is whatever the entity is capable of.%0a%3c Add Mind ••••: Binding a mind into the Sprite allows it to act a vessel for that consciousness. The sprite uses the dice pools of the mind’s owner in performing its tasks. While its mind is absent, the body remains unconscious and must be sustained through other means. If the body expires, the mind remains within the sprite until the end of its duration as normal and then passes to whatever fate it would normally achieve.%0a%3c %0a%3c Magnetic Freak (Forces 4)%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Science, Firearms By rewriting how magnetic objects react to the electromagnetic fields around them, the Mage becomes able to warp and control magnetic materials. This works with normal Scale factors , which define the number and size of the ferrous objects that can be manipulated. These targeted objects can be warped, moved through the air, mechanically reshaped, or otherwise manipulated in any manner appropriate to the strength of the electrical field; for the purposes of any related dice pools (such as attacks, jury-rigging, tearing apart an object, etc), use the spell’s Potency.%0a%3c %0a%3c Piercing Cold (Forces ••••)%0a%3c Practice: Unraveling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Intimidation, Occult, Survival%0a%3c This unraveling of the subject’s heat is an attack spell, inflicting lethal damage equal to its Potency. Against objects, ignore 2 points of Durability unless specifically built for such rapid temperature change. Appropriate liquids and vapours up to the affected Size/Scale are immediately frozen, often with catastrophic effects when subjected to the immediate heat around them. If cast with sufficient Scale, affected subjects already within appropriate liquids (e.g. arm in a full sink, swimming in a pool) may suffer appropriate Tilts, such as Pinned or Immobilized.%0a%3c +1 Reach: Ice thickens over one of the subject’s appendages, freezing it to a nearby surface and causing the Pinned Tilt (HL 143).%0a%3c +2 Reach: The cold creates an entrapping layer of ice over the subject, causing the Immobilized Tilt with Durability equal to half the caster’s Forces rating (rounded up).%0a%3c +1 Reach: For one point of Mana, the spell inflicts aggravated damage.%0a%3c %0a%3c Life Spells%0a%3c The Body Never Lies (Life •)%0a%3c Practice: Knowing/Unveiling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Animal Ken, Empathy, Subterfuge%0a%3c The human body communicates much more than words say. Gestures, natural expressions, unconscious verbal cues, muscle ticks, heartbeat, perspiration, pheromones.%0a%3c Potency is applied as bonus toward Empathy primarily Animal ken and Subterfuge to understand emotional states, lies, and basic intents, though physiological cues and anticipate active primal social instincts, as well as to detect mixed hidden truths.%0a%3c +1 Reach:’ Apply 9-again toward applicable understanding dice pools rolls only.%0a%3c Lesser Life Support (Life ••)%0a%3c Practice: Shielding%0a%3c Cost: 1 Mana%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c This spell is used to keep bodily fluids, individual organs, and substances made up of ‘living’ cells alive beyond normal expectancy outside of a body. For the duration the subject (which must be simple organisms, individual organs, bodily fluids of a more complex organism, or similar substances) are kept alive instead of degrading, from lack of nutrition, needed oxygen, carbon dioxide levels, and other storage factors, allowing cells to reconstitute themselves for the duration of the spell. This does not prevent the cells from ‘aging’ and dying, nor from being killed by more blatantly hostile conditions or violent injury (i.e it prevents no actual damage).%0a%3c This does not extend to complex organisms of any kind as a whole.%0a%3c Add Time ••: The subject substance does not ‘age’, ‘heal’, or grow for the duration of the spell.%0a%3c %0a%3c Carnal Perfection (Life •••)%0a%3c Practice: Perfecting%0a%3c Primeary factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Occult Athletics , Persuasion \\ By changing and rearranging hormones, pheromones, fat and muscle mass, the mage sculpts the subject’s body into the perfect representation of their sex. Add potency to all social rolls in which the body can play a part (similar to striking looks), up to a +5.%0a%3c +1 reach: For 1 mana, allow the bonus to go above +5. Note that this tends to be very obviously supernatural.%0a%3c +1 reach: Apply 8-again to a # of rolls equal to Potency.%0a%3c %0a%3c Living Defense (Life •••)%0a%3c Practice: Perfecting %0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration %0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Medicine, Weaponry%0a%3c By increasing the speed at which the brain transfers signals to the to the muscles that control quick reaction times, the subject is able to use their Dexterity for Defense calculation even if their Wits is lower.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Body Betrays (Life •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Resolve%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Science, Persuasion, Survival%0a%3c For all the vaunted supremacy of the human mind, there are some times that will is a slave to the meat. The Life practitioner exploits this fact, activataing glandular responses and neural impulses to force a subject to take a particular action; what Control Instincts suggests, this spell demands.%0a%3c The action must be able to be encapsulated in a single word, though actually speaking it is not necessary - flee, attack, sleep, sneeze. The action must also be driven by instinct and biology; the Mage could force a subject to scream but not to speak.%0a%3c The subject is compelled to carry out the action for the duration of the spell - in the case of sleep, the subject wakes naturally (i.e. if he is disturbed or their sleep otherwise disrupted). If the action becomes impossible to continue, though, the spell ends early (For instance, making someone vomit ends once their stomach contents are expelled). %0a%3c By default, this spell works only on mundane, living creatures. ‘Psychics’ and minor/half templates count as sufficiently mundane for this.%0a%3c +1 Reach: This spells affects living supernatural creatures normally. This cannot directly provoke a state like Death Rage, however.%0a%3c %0a%3c Matter Spells%0a%3c X-Ray Vision (Matter ••)%0a%3c Practice: Veiling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Crafts, Investigation, Science%0a%3c The subject of this spell is able to look through non-living objects as if they were not there. This does not extend the subject’s senses further than normal or give the subject the ability to see in darkness (without other magial means) but instead see as if non-living objects were not in there.%0a%3c For example the subject could look through a wall and see people in the next room, but could not see said people if there was no lights in the next room or if there were several living trees in the way.%0a%3c This allows the subject to cast sensory-range spells on targets the subject might not ordinary be able to perceive.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The subject can look partway through an object.For example: to see the face of a playing card by looking through the back of the card, or to look part way through a safe to see the tumblers, or to see that someone baked a file/bomb into a cake.%0a%3c Add Life 2: The subject can also see through living things.%0a%3c Add Forces 1: The subject can also see through forces which may block sight.%0a%3c %0a%3c Elixer/Charm (Matter •••/Prime ••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Cost: 1 Mana%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Science, Occult, Crafts%0a%3c Use of this spell allows the caster to temporarily place another spell that he can cast into a physical medium he crafts for later use. This medium can be a potion, unguent, powder, or any small object of size 1 or less, like a small stone or piece of jewelry. The caster must cast this spell to prepare the form, immediately followed by whatever spell he wishes to store, defining all spell factors and Reaches, paying any additional costs of the stored spell, and rolling for the spell, and Paradox if necessary, as normal. Attainments can not be stored this way. If the casting of the stored spell fails, the physical form of the Elixer/Charm is destroyed and the caster must start again. If successful, the spell does not take place at this time though, being stored in the physical medium. Any spell which is intended to affect a target other than the user of the medium is automatically a touch spell, or must be used as an Aimed Spell, the physical medium thrown, squirted or sprayed at the target with a Dex+Athletics roll, who gets their defense and may attempt to Dodge. If the stored spell has an area effect, it may be targetted at a location and effect anything within its range. The caster must define the method of use of the medium at the time of casting, if it is swallowed, rubbed or sprayed on, thrown at a target,crushed underfoot, etc. Regardless of the method, it requires an instant action, and the medium is destroyed in the process. Anyone who performs the activation, even accidentally, will trigger the stored spell. If the duration of the Elixer/Charm spell ends before the stored spell is triggered, the stored spell is lost without effect, but the medium is still destroyed. Both the Elixir spell and any stored spells count towards spell control normally, but may be Combined using the normal systems. %0a%3c In order to use this spell, the mage must incorporate a Sacrament Yantra into the casting, which counts against the normal Yantra limit. This becomes the physical form of the Elixer or Charm. This Sacrament must have an availability rating equal to or higher than the level of the spell the mage wishes to store in the item (if he wants to store a Forces 2 spell, the Sacrament must be Availability 2+). The mage may acquire this material at the normal Availability, or make it himself with the Build Mystic Equipment action (Wits+Occult), using the availability as the penalty to the roll. If that roll is successful, the total cost of components is reduced by 2, to a minimum of 0. (The mage wants a potion capable of storing a Life 3 effect. If he wants to acquire the needed item normally, it will have an Availability of 3. If he wants to make the potion from scratch, it would require a roll of Wits+Occult-3,and if successful, components with Availability 1). In addition, the Potency of the stored spell can’t exceed the the Potency of the Elixer/Charm spell itself (if the Elixer/Charm is cast with Potency 2, the maximum Potency of any spell stored in it is also 2).%0a%3c %0a%3c Extraction (Matter •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Durability%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Crafts, Medicine, Science%0a%3c The mage can separate any non-living material from another, causing it to sublimate, evaporate, or film as it separates.%0a%3c This does not breakdown existing chemical compounds, but may separate free ions in a substrate such as NA from NaCl dissolved within water, but won’t actively break molecules without additional application of other separate factors such as solvent, electricity, electromagnetic energy, enzymes, acids, bases or heat. This spell alone does not cause a physical barrier, and in liquids or gasses, will recombine as a normal reaction at end of duration. Removal of liquids from solids will pool on the surface and is easier to clean off until duration expires.%0a%3c With some substances, recombination may be more dangerous than direct spell use itself if not safely handled.%0a%3c +1 Reach: This spell may be able to cause speed reductions or possibly immobility upon complex devices if chemical power storage or lubricants are compromised.%0a%3c Add Life •••: The spell can affect living subjects to extract non supernatural poisons from a living bloodstream, so that it can be collected cohesively rather than just randomly purged from the system, or have to pass specifically though the kidneys. This could be popular with awakened smokers with tar lung, or removing poisoning that continues to harm after regular healing. This is withstood with Stamina if unwilling.%0a%3c %0a%3c Mind Spells%0a%3c Spirit Conversions%0a%3c The following Spirit spells can be assumed to have Mind-based equivalents at the same level that affect Goetia and similar Mind-related ephemeral entities instead of Spirits:%0a%3c %0a%3c Invoke Bane (Spirit 1)%0a%3c Know Spirit (Spirit 1)%0a%3c Command Spirit (Spirit 2)%0a%3c Shadow Walk (Spirit 2)%0a%3c Bolster Spirit (Spirit 3)%0a%3c Annihilate Spirit (Spirit 5)%0a%3c State of Mind (Mind ••)%0a%3c Practice: Ruling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Composure (only if resisted)%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Persuasion, Expression, Subterfuge%0a%3c The mage alters the subject’s basic mental flow, changing his subconscious and conscious thoughts and emotions to reflect any mental or emotional state the mage wishes.%0a%3c For each level of potency target receives one non-Persistent, mundane Condition. Said Conditions must be one created from the emotional/mental/perceptional state of the target(s), so Conditions such as Notoriety or Connected are not applicable, but conditions such as Deprived, Swooning, Spooked, Steadfast, Guilty, Leveraged, etc. are possible (these are just examples, not a complete list of possible Conditions). These Conditions can be positive or negative (or both).%0a%3c If the target resolves all the Condition before the Duration expires, the spell ends early.%0a%3c +2 Reach: The Conditions created can affect spell casting rolls.%0a%3c Higher Angels, Darker Demons (Mind •••)%0a%3c Practice: Perfecting%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Persuasion, Expression, Occult%0a%3c This spell grants the spell-caster EITHER the merit “Virtuous” OR the merit “Vice-Ridden” (see CoD corebook) which allows for either an extra Virtue or Vice (as applicable) to be applied for the duration of the spell. The extra slot is filled by one personality trait of the caster’s choosing, but the caster’s core personality (their original Virtue/Vice) cannot change. Willpower still may only be gained normally (Vice - once per scene, Virtue - twice per month), but their influence in Social Maneuvering count individually. This means it is possible for a tempting offer that satisfies both Vices makes it easier to manipulate a Mage under the Vice-Ridden merit’s effect, moving them two steps up the Social Maneuvering Impression chart OR an offer that acts in opposition to both Virtues adds two Doors to Social Maneuvering for a mage under the effects of the Virtuous merit.%0a%3c +2 Reach: The caster may benefit from BOTH the Virtuous and the Vice-Ridden merits. The second merit gains an additional trait that is defined at casting. (Default one extra in each)%0a%3c +1 Reach: For every level of Potency, the caster can add one Virtue/Vice (as appropriate) to a pool of traits to choose from. Each of these traits must be defined at spell-casting (and specified as a Virtue or a Vice if using the +2 Reach above). To switch from one trait to another requires a simple meditation roll (COMP+RES) taking several minutes of focused concentration. Again, core personality traits cannot be affected.%0a%3c +2 Reach: As above, however it takes one turn of focused concentration, rather than a meditation roll to switch personality traits.%0a%3c I’m Rubber, You’re Glue (Mind •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Empathy, Intimidation, Politics%0a%3c Based on a principle similar to the old children’s rhyme “I’m Rubber, You’re Glue, Whatever you say bounces off me and sticks to you”, this spell allows the subject to “bounce” back any attempts to Socially Maneuver him, with the result “sticking” to the person making the attempt. During the duration of the spell, the subject may reverse the effects of any Social Maneuvers or merits which would open Doors, up to a number of Doors equal to the potency of the spell, with the same “Goal” effects. %0a%3c The character attempting to open the subject’s doors declares their goal, methods, and makes any rolls as normal, but any doors that would be opened affect the character making the attempt rather than subject. The attacker’s Doors are determined as normal based on the Goal, their own Virtues, Vices, Aspirations, etc. The big bully trying to intimidate the subject suddenly realizes that the skinny guy actually is scary as hell, or the Femme Fatale attempting to seduce him discovers that she really IS “that into him”. %0a%3c If the Social Maneuver or merit is either supernatural in nature, or being bolstered supernaturally, this will provoke a Clash of Wills. %0a%3c +2 Reach: By spending 1 mana, the spell may be cast reflexively in response to a Social Maneuver or merit. %0a%3c +1 Reach: One ADDITIONAL Door is automatically opened. This Reach can be applied up to two times.%0a%3c %0a%3c Recollect (Mind •••)%0a%3c Practice: Perfecting%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Empathy, Medicine, Persuasion%0a%3c The mage reminds the subject’s dream body of what it was like when it was first formed. The mage can heal her subject’s dream body of injuries by collecting and reforming bits of the subject’s dream essence and reassembling the dream body as when the subject’s dream body was first formed.%0a%3c Each level of Potency heals two boxes of bashing damage of Dream Health.%0a%3c +1 Reach: Potency can be spent to recover 1 Lethal instead of 2 Bashing.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The mage may heal Personal Tilts on the subject’s dream body such as Arm Wrack, forcing broken bones back into shape on his dream form.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The spell reproduces the effects of a full night’s rest in the subject, including regaining a point of Willpower if applicable.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Quick and the Dead (Mind •••)%0a%3c Practice: Perfecting %0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration %0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Empathy, Expression%0a%3c By increasing the speed at which the neural pathways transfer signals to the rest of the body, the subject is able to use their Wits for Defense calculation even if their Dexterity is lower.%0a%3c %0a%3c Transfer Will (Mind •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Empathy, Persuasion, Medicine%0a%3c The mage effects a transaction between two individuals, the recipient and the donor, shifting a Willpower dot from the latter to the former.%0a%3c The recipient must have sacrificed a dot of Willpower to relinquish control of a spell or to contribute to some other magical working. The recipient regains the lost Willpower dot, and the donor loses a dot. The spell only works in the case of an entirely willing donor, who may not be in any way tricked or supernaturally influenced.%0a%3c +2 Reach: For 1 mana, the effect is Lasting%0a%3c %0a%3c Prime Spells%0a%3c Shield of Truth (Prime ••)%0a%3c Practice: Shielding%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Occult, Expression, Empathy%0a%3c By bolstering the truth of this spell’s subject, it defends against the falsehood of the Abyss. This spell protects the subject against the Numina, Influences, and Manifestations of Acamoths, Gulcamoths, and similar ephemeral Abyssal enttities. Any attempts to pierce the shield provokes a Clash of Wills.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The protection afforded by this spell extends to Abyssals’ physical attacks.%0a%3c Nimbus Inversion (Prime ••)%0a%3c Practice: Ruling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Withstand: Resolve%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Politics, Brawl, Socialize%0a%3c The Supernal burns out from every mage, leaking out into the world, marking the use of their power. By twisting the flow, the power flows not outwards but inwards, empowering or debilitating the mage as they themselves empower or debilitate the world and those around them; mechanically, the subject, who must be a mage, becomes affected by their own Nimbus Tilt. %0a%3c The seal placed upon the mage remains in place for the duration but the effects of the nimbus remains only for the duration it would normally last, thus a spell causing the nimbus to flare will cause the effect to impact the caster for a number of rounds equal to the potency of the effect.%0a%3c +2 Reach: The Nimbus remains in effect for the full remaining duration of the spell after it is triggered.%0a%3c %0a%3c Blaze of Glory (Prime •••)%0a%3c Practice: Perfecting%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Composure%0a%3c Cost: 1 Mana%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Politics, Persuasion, Intimidation%0a%3c This spell allows a mage to channel mana in order to enhance a supernal nimbus. For the Duration of the effect, the subjects’s Immediate Nimbus is treated as if his Gnosis has increased by the Potency of the spell. This only intensifies existing tilts (positives become more positive, negatives become more negative). If the subjects’s Immediate Nimbus normally causes multiple tilts (for example &#8722;1 Resolve, +1 Presence) the caster may choose how the additional effects are applied within the current tilts. In addition, the subject’s Immediate Nimbus is considered to be flaring for the duration of the spell, as if done purposely, and so is visible even to mundane perception. All normal effects and drawbacks of this still apply. This effect only affects subjects with a naturally occurring supernal nimbus.%0a%3c +2 Reach: The mage may apply a new tilt, or multiple new tilts, up to the total of that granted by the increased effective Gnosis. However, the subjects normal tilts still are in effect, and may conflict with or counteract applied ones. (IE, if the subject has a &#8722;1 Resolve tilt normally, and a +2 Resolve tilt is applies with this effect, it would have the total effect of having a +1 Resolve tilt.)%0a%3c %0a%3c Communion (Prime •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Withstand: Resolve%0a%3c Cost: 1+ Mana%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Computer, Occult, Socialize%0a%3c The greatest works of the Wise require every possible advantage in their creation and so with this magic an apprentice may assist their master with greater works rather than being a hindrance to the process. Those mages under the effects of the Communion, up to the spell’s potency, roll their Gnosis as a pool with each success reducing the penalties to the primary caster’s spell roll. This dice pool may not be modified by Willpower, magic, or other means. This burns a single mana from each participant. %0a%3c +2 Reach: The assisting mages may add their own Arcana to their Gnosis pool.%0a%3c %0a%3c Consume Passion (Prime •••/Fate ••)%0a%3c Practice: Perfecting%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Empathy, Expression, Occult%0a%3c This spell taps into the idyllic properties of a sufficiently ecstatic experience, absorbing a single point of Mana into the subject.%0a%3c %0a%3c These ecstatic expressions must be intense, emotionally charged, and mind-altering. Even raucous parties are not enough: only an expression iconic and powerful enough to shake the Fallen world, even for a moment, may be tapped into. Deep religious rituals, strong drug/insanity trips, live sacrifice, glossalalia, suspension, mutilation, witnessing a failed Breaking Point, and other experiences that produce an altered or disassociative mental state might apply. On the supernatural side, states of uncontrolled passion (Kuruth, frenzy, etc) can be used if the caster is daring enough to risk their time and presence. Emotionally intense supernatural acts (not casual/quick exchanges) ending with supernatural energies may also apply. For example, watching a hunt for fresh prey’s blood, glamour, or other energies that culminates in a dramatic feeding. Formal Oblations and other acts that already generate Mana may not apply, nor do states directly caused (not merely catalyzed) by magic: the energies and connections those actions tap into are already being used.%0a%3c %0a%3c A subject may not gain more total Mana from this spell in a day than the latest caster’s dots in Prime, and any Mana infused into a subject that cannot contain it naturally dissipates at the end of the spell’s Duration.%0a%3c %0a%3c Create Tass (Prime •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Cost: 1+ Mana%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Crafts, Occult, Expression%0a%3c The mage may channel Mana into a physical form, creating a piece of tass that represents an idealized Supernal form. The object created must be a simple object or tool no greater than Size 5 (food, swords, and gemstones are allowable, while guns and cars are not), and is obviously magical. The tass may appear menacing or intricate, but cannot perform tasks significantly; even high Durability item are too brittle to really cut or drive screws, for example. Any usage as a tool is considered to be improvised, and each action doing so expends 1 Mana from the tass. In addition, the tass has no explicit energy, nor it is subject to normal laws regarding its form. For example, tass food does not spoil, but neither does it nourish the eater, and the mage is advised not to increase the Durability of food beyond 1 if they expect it to be eaten.%0a%3c The tass has a default Durability of 1 and consists of one point of Mana (which the mage must pay as part of the casting). Potency may be allocated to increasing the Durability or Mana capacity on a one-for-one basis. When all Mana is withdrawn from the tass, it crumbles to nothing. A mage may “refill” the tass with the Channel Mana spell or similar effects. When the spell’s Duration runs out, any unused Mana sublimates back into the world and is lost.%0a%3c Add Forces 3: The object is not obviously magical.%0a%3c Add Life 2: Tass created as food/water is nourishing at the cost of expending 1 Mana.%0a%3c +2 Reach: The effect is Lasting (though the tass still crumbles if all its Mana is expended or absorbed.)%0a%3c %0a%3c Focused Aetheric Winds (Prime •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Expression, Occult%0a%3c The Mage calls forth a bare fraction of the howling fury of the Aether, blasting their subject with supernal winds. This is an attack spell, inflicting bashing damage equal to Potency.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The winds of the spell are focused on a particular point, inflicting the Arm Wrack or Leg Wrack tilt.%0a%3c +1 Reach: In lieu of damage, the mage may assign Potency to instead destroy the target’s Mana. One level of Potency so designed destroys one point of Mana, and Potency mzu be freely split between Mana destruction and damage.%0a%3c %0a%3c Forge Glamour (Prime •••)%0a%3c Practice: Perfecting%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Cost: 1+ Mana%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Larceny, Persuasion, Socialize%0a%3c As the Realm of Platonic Exemplars, the Supernal Realm of the Aether provides the essential nature of the worlds, this is seen most obviously in the constructs sculpted from raw mana which is the Thaumaturges right. More complicated are the esoteric ideas, the roles assumed by the Thespians, but these truths are no less than the Perfect Sword or the Perfect Hammer. Weaving a pattern of mana about their person, the Thespian draws down a piece of this perfected concept, assuming the role as it exists in its perfected state. This glamour suffuses them with props which serve their role and only their role, but these things remain insubstantial mere concepts to satisfy a need to present the correct postures. Potency may be allocated tot he following effects:%0a%3c %0a%3c A dice bonus akin to striking looks while engaging in the role portrayed.%0a%3c Increase Mana capacity by +1 (the mage may fill this Mana capacity by spending Mana as part of the casting or%0a%3c leave the object partially empty)%0a%3c %0a%3c +1 Reach: The Illusion of the Glamour may improve a Persona Yantra, splitting its potency towards perfecting it to a maximum of +4.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The Truth of the Illusion may be flared, burning a point of mana from its pattern to grant an 8-again to the dice roll.%0a%3c Add Forces 3: The illusion is not obviously magical.%0a%3c %0a%3c Not on My Watch (Prime •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Cost: 1 Mana%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Occult, Athletics, Persuasion%0a%3c For the duration of this spell, the Mage becomes better able to Counter certain spells, not just causing them to fizzle but launching them back at their caster. When targeted by a single-target, hostile spell, the Mage may use the Counterspell attainment with the requisite Arcana (NOT Universal Counterspell) to cause the spell to be reflected upon the caster instead of simply fizzling. The spell takes effect as if the original caster were the target, with other spell effects working normally. The spell may be dismissed normally still, but any lasting effects remain.%0a%3c +2 Reach: The caster may invoke this as a Reflexive Action for an additional Mana, allowing them to cast it while Counterspelling.%0a%3c %0a%3c Raising the Pillars (Prime •••)%0a%3c Practice: Perfecting%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Crafts, Persuasion, Science%0a%3c ”And the Druids turned to stone…” Libertines have a great affinity for the magic of humanity allowing them to use its practices to exemplify their own supernal magic through the presence of even sleepers. This spell allows a mage to reinforce the Supernal Truth of an Environmental Yantra composed of Sleepwalkers or a Techne Instrument composed of Sleepers increasing their collective bonus to the Potency of the spell, this remains limited by the normal rule that no Yantra may exceed a +5 bonus. A group can provide a bonus no higher than the number of its members.%0a%3c %0a%3c Supernal Eidolon (Prime •••)%0a%3c Practice: Perfecting%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Cost: 1+ Mana%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Occult, Expression or Academics%0a%3c The mage calls on her vision of a perfect magical tool for a spell she plans to work. She creates from Tass (see Platonic Form) the perfect tool for a specific spell. For each potency she achieves on Eidolon the tool provides a +1 Yantra bonus (remember a single Yantra can’t grant more than a +5 bonus) for a specific spell (which can be a Rote, Praxis or a regular spell) or increase it’s Mana capacity by 1. The spell must be from one of the mages ruling Arcana. As Platonic Form spell the Tass holds by default 1 Mana and 1 mana is drained from the Yantra each time it is used. The tool created by this spell is a simple representation of size 1 or 2 max and has 1 Durability.%0a%3c A Yantra can be made for another mage to use but it still follows all the same rules (ie: the yantra can only effect spells from the creator’s Ruling Arcana.)%0a%3c Note: Spell stacking rules apply; only the highest Potency Supernal Eidolon can be used for a given spell as a Yantra. +1 Reach: The tool is the perfect Yantra for all spells of a specific ruling Arcana the mage possesses%0a%3c +1 Reach: The tool encompasses an additional Ruling Arcana the mage possesses%0a%3c %0a%3c Witchlight (Prime •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Expression, Occult, Science%0a%3c The mage manifests a mote of the Aether’s raw revelatory energies, making light that is visible only to Active Mage Sight. It often appears as an orb of fire or electricity, but may look like anything unliving between the size of a walnut and a torch. Witchlights have substance, but are of negligible weight, able to be scooped up by hand. It provides no heat or force, and does not evoke special responses by appearance (e.g. frenzy or bans from fire); however, the appearance may still be shocking, or provoke responses related to light if it can be perceived. It may be held, positioned on a subject, or launched as an aimed spell like a flare. If a target wishes to resist a witchlight’s attachment to their Pattern, use Composure as a Withstand to make it simply slide off and continue with its natural momentum.%0a%3c A witchlight illuminates 10 yards per point of Potency clearly enough to make rolls without penalties for darkness, and twice that range at half the darkness penalty (rounded down). The light may be willfully dimmed, enhanced, or strobed to inflict the Poor Lighting Condition within its range of clear illumination.%0a%3c +1 Reach: Increase the witchlight to the size of a bonfire, doubling its range of illumination.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The light may be made visible to all supernatural entities, or even revealed fully into the Fallen world.%0a%3c +2 Reach and 1 Mana: The witchlight is Lasting, but cannot be fixed to a living target, burst, or change its level of illumination.%0a%3c %0a%3c Burden of Power (Prime 4)%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Withstand: Resolve%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Occult, Athletics, Persuasion%0a%3c Heavy is the burden of magic but heavier still, some would say, is the active weight of it upon its caster’s pattern. This spell transfers the burden of a spell from its caster’s pattern to a suitable pattern, whether it be another mage or a sympathetic sleepwalker.%0a%3c Reach +1: The spell may be transferred to an imbued item capable of casting the spell.%0a%3c Reach +2: Control of the spell is also relinquished to the recipient of the spell for its duration. This causes the Burden to be Lasting, but not the transferred spell’s duration which remains unchanged.%0a%3c %0a%3c Ecstasy (Prime ••••)%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Composure%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Empathy, Expression, Occult%0a%3c The spell inspires an overwhelmingly revelatory state of euphoria and/or terror in the subject, inspiring convulsions and other autonomic functions. It inflicts the Insensate Tilt for the Duration of the spell, or until the Tilt is resolved (for instance, by being attacked beyond this spell’s effects).%0a%3c +1 Reach: The subject receives a Supernal vision that offers great insight. The subject takes on the Humbled Tilt toward the caster (MtA 316), and likely has justification for life changes and Bluebooks.%0a%3c %0a%3c Imbued With Power (Prime 4)%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Withstand: Resolve (if resisted)%0a%3c Cost: 1 Mana%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Occult, Animal Ken or Subterfuge%0a%3c The spell allows a mage to imbued a Sleepwalker or another Mage with a small gift of their power. The mage casts the spell and ties it to the target’s pattern. The spell is only half formed allowing for some flexibility to the recipient to use.%0a%3c The target may cast the spell at anytime the caster could and makes all the decisions for the spell. The target can spend reach and uses the dice pool of the caster. However any mana that the spell needs or might use must be spent when Imbue With Power is cast unless the target has their own Mana to spend (The mage may place Mana with the Imbued With Power spell). It should be noted that the recipient cannot use Yantra’s with this spell or benefit from Ritual casting (although they still can to avoid spending Reach to make the spell Instant.)%0a%3c Imbue With Power has a drawback. Paradox is suffered by both the caster and target of the mage of any spell unleashed by Imbued With Power. While Paradox can be dealt with normally if the recipient is a Sleepwalker without Wisdom they cannot internalize it.%0a%3c The gifted spell can be used a number of times equal to this spell’s potency. The target of this spell cannot gain more potency of their gifted spell than Imbue With Power’s potency.%0a%3c +X Reach and 1 Mana - When casting Imbued With Power the mage may also include an Attainment that can be included with the spell. X is equal to the Attainment’s required Arcana level. This may only be an attainment that enhances or alters the spell directly; Temporal Sympathy could be added, for instance, but not Mage Armor.%0a%3c %0a%3c Lamina (Prime ••••)%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Stamina%0a%3c Cost: 1 Mana per subject%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Expression, Crafts, Occult%0a%3c The mage exudes and crystallizes a pelt of mana over the subject’s flesh, fusing a protective layer of tass to the mana that constitutes the subject’s pattern. Each level of Potency may be directed to 1 point of general or ballistic armor. Naturally, the subject glows like a lamp to anyone capable of sensing mana, and is unlikely to be able to explain their appearance to Sleepers.%0a%3c +1 Reach: Mana may be invested into the lamina to make it immune to the Armor Piercing effect for a turn. This may be invested during casting and held until use, or spent directly by the subject. Unused Mana is not destroyed when the spell ends, but sublimates into the world and likely returns to the nearest Hallow.%0a%3c +1 Reach, add Matter •••: The lamina becomes immune to the Armor Piercing effect.%0a%3c +1 Reach, add Forces or Matter ••(+): Features of the lamina (e.g. horns, spikes, fangs, etc.) act like natural weapons, with a lethal damage bonus equal to half the added Forces or Matter rating (choose only one), rounded up.%0a%3c %0a%3c Manipulate Pattern (Prime 4)%0a%3c Practice: Unravelling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Stamina%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Medicine, Larceny, Empathy%0a%3c Sacrifice is the most potent of magics. A mage may burn through his own life to replenish his magical reserves. Control of the Aetheric Wind allows them to go beyond the limits of their own pattern, reaching further and using those currents not as a blunt instructment but a precise tool with which they can begin to deconstruct the world into its most raw compontent part: Mana. Scouring or Restoring a pattern is the most basic practice a mage can perform, it is an essential quality to the awakened soul. This spell may restore a target’s pattern with mana or damage a pattern for mana using the normal conversion rates. Mages who possess Life’s Second Attainment: Improved Pattern Restoration may choose whether they wish to apply its effects to another living person when the spell is cast.%0a%3c Reach +1: An inanimate object (worth at least Availability 2) may be scoured or repaired. Most possess only a single point of mana but rare or priceless objects may contain more. Repairing requires a point of mana per point of structure. Scouring the last point of mana from an inanimate object causes it to crumble and dissipate into nothing.%0a%3c %0a%3c Power Words (Prime ••••/Fate ••••)%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Withstand: Resolve%0a%3c Cost: 1 Mana%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Academics, Occult, Expression%0a%3c High Speech is a conduit to the Realms Above, uniquely formed by the symbols the words entwine and their contextual intent for the Imago. A mixture of Patterning between Prime and Fate apply Supernal perfection to the subject’s High Speech, imbuing succinct words of power with the same symbolic value, intent, and determination as longer and/or repetitive mantras. As long as the subject may speak, High Speech may be used as a secondary reflexive yantra (MtA 119).%0a%3c +1 Reach: This extension of raw intent applies the subject’s unbridled articulations of magical symbolism to their High Speech. The yantra die bonus of using High Speech mantras (MtA 119) is substituted by the subject’s unaltered Occult rating (to a maximum of +5), even if this causes the character to receive a lower die bonus, or none at all. If used in this manner, High Speech may still be used as a reflexive Yantra, but loses its “secondary” quality (and thus cannot go over turn limits on yantra).%0a%3c %0a%3c Sanctuary (Prime 4)%0a%3c Practice: (Patterning)%0a%3c Cost: (1 Mana)%0a%3c Primary Factor: (Duration)%0a%3c Withstand: (Resolve) Optional%0a%3c %0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: (Academics,Occult, Empathy)%0a%3c For its duration, the caster may choose to grant the subject(s) of Sanctuary the effects of any Mage Armor the caster currently has in effect, at the appropriate level of effect. If the caster changes his Mage Armor, this change also effects the subjects of the Sanctuary. %0a%3c IE, the mage casts Sanctuary, using the Scale Factor to effect two targets. He then raises his Matter 3 Mage Armor for one mana. This would also grant both of the subjects of this spell 3 General Armor which ignores Armor Piercing. If the mage then spent a mana (and a reflexive action) to change to Life 3 Mage Armor, both subjects would lose the 3 General Armor (and the hardening against Armor Piercing), but gain 2 General Armor, and +2 Defense using the higher of (their OWN) wits or dexterity. %0a%3c If the subject of this spell is unwilling, he may withstand with Resolve, and if the subject is another mage, they may choose, at any time, to use their own Mage Armor instead of that granted by Sanctuary, at the normal cost to change Mage Armor (1 Mana and a Reflexive Action).\\ +1 Reach: The subjects and the caster of the Sanctuary may share the protection of any Mage Armor raised by any subject. IE, the mage cast Sanctuary on another Awakened. That mage has Time 4 Mage Armor in effect. The caster, and any other subjects of the Sanctuary spell, add +4 to their Defense, may use their Defense vs firearms, and if they succeed at a Dodge Action, they can reduce the attackers Initiative by 4 for the remainder of the scene by spending a mana (if they have any). If there are multiple mages as the subject of the Sanctuary, with different Mage Armors active, a subject may choose any of the active Mage Armors (or any they themselves possess), to be activated for 1 mana and a reflexive action.%0a%3c %0a%3c Sanctum Sanctorum (Prime ••••)%0a%3c Practice: (Perfecting)%0a%3c Primary Factor: (Potency)%0a%3c Withstand: Sanctum Rating (if any) Suggested Rote Skills: (Occult, Expression, Academics)%0a%3c With this spell, the caster may sanctify an area, causing it to act as a Sanctum or increasing the rating of an existing Sanctum, or defile an area or existing Sanctum, reducing it’s rating. If the area is currenly not a Sanctum, it becomes one with a rating equal to the spells potency. If it is a existing Sanctum, the rating is either raised or lowered by 1 (to a maximum of 5, or minimum of &#8722;5), withstood by the current Sanctum rating (absolute value). If an area has a negative Sanctum rating, it SUBTRACTS its value from Gnosis to determine spell control. %0a%3c +2 Reach: For 1 Mana, the effect is Lasting%0a%3c %0a%3c Squaring the Circle (Prime •••• OR optionally Prime ••• Mind ••••)%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Brawl, Expression, Occult%0a%3c An enhanced version of Display of Power, rather than merely providing a visible representation of a spell’s Imago, this rote projects a visible and audible representation of what the results would be if those Imagos were expressed in the Fallen World. This provides a more dynamic display that allows the mages involved to show off their personal styles, as well as makes witnessing the duel more interesting.%0a%3c The sensory effects provided by this spell are obviously illusory (visuals are translucent and sounds are distant and hollow), and will not fool anyone witnessing them that they are real.%0a%3c +2 Reach: For one Mana, any attempt to Counterspell (p. 192) a spell cast within the area gains the rote action quality, as the plainly visible Imago makes the spell easy to decipher. (In many duels, seconds are appointed to stand ready to Counterspell attempts at cheating.)%0a%3c %0a%3c Thaumaturgical Forge (Prime 4)%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Craft, Occult, Science%0a%3c Form follows function and when it comes to the processes of enchantment, patterns and symbols sympathetic to the nature of the enchantment provides clearer focus. Humans have known this for ages. Fire has power. Iron has power. The instruments of the awakened provide a focus to magic and with the right changes to their supernal resonance, a focus to enchantment. This spell empowers a single yantra per potency to be used during the process of Imbuing an item, providing its bonuses to the Gnosis + Prime pool of the Fourth Prime Attainment: Imbue Item. A mage remains limited in the number of yantras used by their gnosis. %0a%3c Tool Instruments must in some way be a part of the item being imbued. A cup, a coin, a staff, or some other Order style object, a material that resonates with the purpose of the spell included is another example. A sympathy included may be used to benefit from that sympathetic connection either as a bonus or as a necessary sympathetic connection in its use. An environmental yantra locks the item to that environment but a church is a church is a church, the symbols are the important part. A shadowname’s persona locks the item to the individual mage and those whose persona share a symbolism. It is common for masters and apprentices to share such symbolism.%0a%3c Reach +1: Yantras used in the creation of the object are applied as permanent bonuses to its casting total.%0a%3c %0a%3c Space Spells%0a%3c Nothing Between (Space •)%0a%3c Practice: Unveiling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Investigation, Science, Empathy%0a%3c If space is a lie, it must follow that distance is a lie. By means of this spell, the subject may see across vast distances as though she were immediately next to everything she sees. She could reading small print on the other side of the room or counting hairs on someone’s head as though they were right next to it.%0a%3c Multiply the distance at which the subject can see before suffering penalties by this spell’s Potency. Atmospheric conditions may impact this vision, as it effectively creates a telescope.%0a%3c +1 Reach: This spell allows the subject to see out to a number of miles equal the Mage’s dots in the Space Arcanum.%0a%3c +1 Reach: This spell applies to hearing as well as sight.%0a%3c +1 Reach: This spell can ignore intervening atmospheric conditions.%0a%3c Crossroads (Space ••)%0a%3c Practice: Ruling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Computers, Politics, Athletics%0a%3c How many roads must a man walk down, before you call him a man… Roads are but the connections between two points, moving along one is as simple as taking that first step. This spell allows the mage to step upon the beginning of an unobstructed conduit, corridor, path, road, track, trail, or tunnel and reach its terminus immediately or instead to step from one crossroads, junction, or node to the next. This requires that the ‘road’ is navigable. If it is not, the spell ends immediately at an physical obstruction that would prevent further travel, whether it be a door in a hallway, thick underbrush grown over a trail, a tree fallen over a path, or rush hour traffic if one is traveling via automobile.%0a%3c +1 Reach (Add Forces 2): The subject of the spell may use a virtual circuit, electrical conduit, or signal to define the path. This can be exceedingly difficult as many such paths travel unnavigable terrain in one form or another.%0a%3c +1 Reach (Add Prime 2): The subject of the spell may step from one node to the next along a leyline. This can be exceedingly difficult has many such paths traverse over the globe through physical objects.%0a%3c %0a%3c Spirit Spells%0a%3c Essence Conversion (Spirit/4)%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: None%0a%3c Cost: 1 Essence or 1 mana+Converted Essence or mana%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Occult, Science, Survival%0a%3c Bountiful but twisted super power storage of the Fallen world, Essence empowers abilities of spirits and ghosts drawn though nature and humanity in many forms. Patturning it’s energy, can be transfered to other forms of supernatural energy, but with some little efficiency loss.%0a%3c Often best applied in combined cast with Channel Essence, Works with essence held by caster or with freely available energy within area of effect. Choose one conversion function at a time.%0a%3c Essence can be altered and distilled to chosen singular form of Essence Resonance “flavor” or other following options that the mage has encountered previously.\\ Add Prime ••••: As a bonded familiar may do, A mage may Convert potency number of Essence to Mana, or Mana to Essence.%0a%3c Add Mind ••••: Essence Conversion Includes ability to Convert potency number of Essence to and From Ephemera utilized by Psychic Vampires\\ Add Fate ••••: As some Essence and Glamour share a common sources of Empatho-trophic energy. A mage may Convert potency number of Essence into Glamour, or Glamour into Essence.%0a%3c With Life ••••: a living fluid substance may be infused to produce a nutritionally viable substance for potent Kindred Vitae at a 1 essence to 1 vitae value. With Life •••• Matter ••••: a non living substance may be used.%0a%3c +2 Reach: The mage may “flavor” the Essence with multiple Resonances she has previously encountered.%0a%3c Time Spells%0a%3c Timekeeper (Time •)%0a%3c Practice: Unveiling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Withstand: None%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Drive, Empathy, Politics%0a%3c By use of this spell, the subject becomes aware of their absolute time, as well as the relative time between events. For instance, they could measure exactly how many seconds it takes for someone to run a lap without the use of a stopwatch. The subject not only detects when time has been sped up or slowed down, but they become aware of how much time “should” have passed.%0a%3c +1 Reach: By measuring the passage of moments, the subject may look upon a project that has been undertaken and know exactly when it’ll be complete. They could tell you exactly how long until a Kettle boils, the exact second a pregnant woman will give birth, or when a cathedral would be completed under present circumstances. Large scale projects that will be completed far in advance will return a likely range. When an Extended Action is evaluated, it returns how long it’ll take to complete on average and how long each interval is.%0a%3c Dusty Trails (Time ••)%0a%3c Practice: Veiling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Composure%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Investigation, Stealth, Subterfuge%0a%3c The subject appears completely distinct from one event in their past per Potency. Any mundane attempt to link them to their occluded past through physical or circumstantial evidence fails, and supernatural attempts to link the subject to their past provokes a Clash of Wills. This spell has no effect on memories. Without the aid of Temporal Sympathy, only events in the unchanged past may be occluded.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The subject is can not be tracked as their link to their own footsteps fades.%0a%3c Five O’Clock Shadow (Time ••)%0a%3c Practice: Veiling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: None%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Politics, Survival, Subterfuge%0a%3c This spell allows a Mage to alter the subject’s apparent age, or to make them rapidly progress or regress through time: someone could be made to appear older or younger; a seed could become a plant, or a plant could become a seed; a plant could be made to bear fruit or wither away as though it were winter; hair and nails could be lengthened and shortened; a kettle could be made to boil or cool. The changes brought on by this spell are illusionary, and some supernatural powers (including Time Mage Sight) may see through them with a successful Clash of Wills%0a%3c +1 Reach: This spell may cause the subject to detect as being from another time entirely, or to detect as moving faster or slower through time, or any other number of temporal anomolies with a Clash of Wills.%0a%3c Fog of Ages (Time ••)%0a%3c Practice: Veiling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Resolve%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Academics, Larceny, Subterfuge%0a%3c By means of this spell, an Apprentice of Time can hide the past from the subject. One consecutive Scene per Potency of the spell is obscured, meaning the subject can not remember it or acknowledge the results of it. +1 Reach: The scenes obscured by this spell no longer need to be consecutive. %0a%3c +1 Reach: Instead of obscuring entire scenes, this spell can obscure specific events within a scene while leaving the rest of the event unchanged.%0a%3c Procrastination (Time ••)%0a%3c Practice: Shielding%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: None%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Occult, Socialize, Survival%0a%3c Sure the subject might have just been hit by a truck or eaten by a grue, and yes a Disciple of Time has to deal with the fact that actually happened… but… they’ll get around to it later. This spell protects the subject’s pattern from being changed by what is going on in the present. Up to one Condition, Tilt, or instance of Damage may be suspended per point of Potency. When Damage is suspended, you only suspend a number of health levels equal to Potency. Directly supernatural changes require a Clash of Wills to suspend. When this spell’s duration wears off, all suspended events affect the subject instantly.%0a%3c +1 Reach: Once the spell ends, suspended effects happen at a rate of one per turn.%0a%3c Witnessed Postcognition (Time ••)%0a%3c Practice: Ruling%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Academics, Empathy, Investigation%0a%3c Like the spell it is based on, Shared Postcongition allows a mage to propel a willing target’s senses back in time, though this acts as a breaking point for Sleepers. %0a%3c +1 Reach: The subject can “scrub” the vision like a video, speeding it up, slowing it down, rewinding it, pausing it, etc.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The subject remains aware of her surroundings, and does not lose Defense.%0a%3c %0a%3c Arcadian Hours (Time •••)%0a%3c Practice: Fraying%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Target Spell’s Caster’s Arcana Rating%0a%3c ‘Suggested Rote Skills: Occult, Drive or Persuasion%0a%3c The mage targets a spell causing it to be expended more quickly. If successful, this spell causes the targeted spell to elapse at a rate of (1 + Potency) times faster until this spell expires. This cannot reduce the duration beyond 1 remaining turn.%0a%3c %0a%3c Changing the Clock Face (Time •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Composure%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Academics, Stealth, Persuasion%0a%3c This spell allows a mage to cause the subject to rapidly progress or regress through time up to one year per Potency. Unlike Five O’Clock Shadow, these changes are real. However, they produce no mechanical benefit or hinderance, but they may have cosmetic and some narrative impact. For instance, someone made older by this spell would look and feel different, but they would have the same traits and they would live the same length of time after this spell.%0a%3c Long Day (Time •••)%0a%3c Practice: Fraying%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Stamina%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Academics, Socialize, Survival%0a%3c This spell makes the subject profoundly feel every moment they’ve been awake, even if they’ve just awoken. They gain the Lethargic Condition as though they have been awake for 1 hour per point of Potency and must make an immediate roll to stay awake. At the ST’s discretion, subjects who don’t feel fatigue may be immune to this spell.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The subject takes 1 Bashing Damage per point of Potency which can not be healed so long as the subject has the Lethargic condition.%0a%3c Lost Time (Time •••)%0a%3c Practice: Fraying%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Composure%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Academics, Socialize%0a%3c People get lost in the moment—they are having fun, or hard at work, and suddenly it’s a few hours later and they are left wondering where the time went? This spell allows the Mage to degrade the subject’s ability to change with the progression of time, inflicting the Insensate Tilt. If they were engaged in a reasonably inane task that requires little important decision making (such as reading, playing a game, watching TV, etc) they will continue to do it.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The subject becomes unaware of their surroundings for the duration of the spell.%0a%3c Sequel (Time •••)%0a%3c Practice: Weaving%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Resolve%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Persuasion, Science, Survival%0a%3c With this spell, a Mage can force someone to relive past trials and victories. The subject gains one mundane, non-persistent Condition or Tilt per dot of the spell’s Potency that they have experienced in the past. The mage can select conditions they know about, or simply seek out conditions that match broad criteria (in which case the subject’s player chooses something appropriate). Without the Temporal Sympathy Attainment, this spell can only cause someone to to be affected by Conditions and Tilts experienced in the Unchanged past.%0a%3c +2 Reach: You may add a supernatural Condition or Tilt so long as you have another Arcana related to your choice rated at ••• or higher.%0a%3c Accelerate Metabolism (Time ••••)%0a%3c Practice: Perfecting%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Withstand: Stamina (If Resisted)%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Medicine or Science%0a%3c The spell accelerates the bodies natural healing process. Normally the domain of Shamans this spell still see’s use from desperate mages despite it’s drawbacks. For each potency of the spell the subject’s healing times are halved. The spell however puts enourmous strain on the subject which gains the Drained condition once they’ve been under this spell’s influence for a number of hours greater than the target’s Stamina. The condition is persistent until the spells end. Afterwards it can be cleared by eating enough food and getting some rest.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The subject’s accelerated metabolism helps them react faster granting +1 Initiative per Potency.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The mage spends 1 addtional Mana and subject(s) does not gain the Drained condition from this spell%0a%3c %0a%3c Co-Temperus (Time ••••)%0a%3c Mana Cost: 1%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Larceny, Politics, Subterfuge%0a%3c By making the present as indeterminable as the future, this spell can allow the subject to participate in multiple ‘potential presents’ simultaneously. The subject splits into one additional version of themselves per Potency. This is not a true division of the subject, but instead is the subject existing in multiple timelines. They share a single Willpower and Mana pool, but are otherwise treated as separate. At the beginning of the subject’s turn, each version of themselves may perform their actions as normal. However, apply the results of only one version of the subject on the world around them, and each version of the subject completely ignores what the others do (sometimes even occupying the same space). For instance, if one version of the subject opens a door and goes through it, all other versions of the subject still have to open the door and walk through it. If at the end of the turn the subject chooses to apply the changes of another version of themselves who did not open the door on the world, then the door would be closed at the end of the turn (having never been opened). Any supernatural powers that affect one or more versions of the subject affects all of them. When the spell ends or is canceled, only one version of the subject sticks around, and that version suffers all of the damage, conditions and tilts suffered by all other versions of themselves, but also gains all knowledge and experiences from the discarded versions of themselves.%0a%3c Add Mind (••): The different versions of the subject may communicate telepathically.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The different versions of the subject are more insulated from each other. When one or more of them is affected by a supernatural power, then they may roll a Clash of Wills to keep all other versions from themselves from being equally affected.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The version of the subject that remains after the spell expires gains the worst damage from all versions of themselves, instead of all of it.%0a%3c Note: A Space •••• equivalent of this spell exists, but relies on a duplication of the character’s spatial presence instead of timelines.%0a%3c %0a%3c Encore (Time ••••)%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Composure%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Expression, Science%0a%3c By means of this spell, the Mage can cause someone to repeat the actions of the past. Without the Temporal Sympathy attainment, the Mage chooses one instant action the subject performed in the unchanged past. The subject performs that same action on their next turn. They perform the same motions and thoughts they did, without regards to their surroundings. This makes interacting with a changing world imprecise (i.e. striking an opponent who has moved would cause them to strike at the same spot).%0a%3c +1 Reach: Instead of an instant action, the subject will repeat an entire Scene. This reach may be selected multiple times, causing the subject to repeat more than one scene’s worth of actions.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The subject will adjust their motions to try and produce the same result as their prior actions. Someone who read a book will pick up that same book to read if it is handy. Someone who threw a punch would throw a punch at the same target if they are nearby. If the subject can’t achieve the same result with only minor adjustments, they will mime the action normally.%0a%3c +3 Reach: As above, but the Mage may select new targets for the subject’s actions. The decision for what replaces the old target is made when the spell is cast, and that decision persists for the duration of the spell.%0a%3c Hung Action (Time ••••)%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Duration%0a%3c Withstand: None%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Athletics, Medicine, Subterfuge%0a%3c One mundane instant action performed by the subject while this spell is active becomes “hung” in time. Resolve the effects of the action then, but instead of performing that action the subject merely passes their turn. When this spell’s duration ends or it is canceled, the suspended action affects the world. Many mages use the the Fate •• attainment Conditional Duration on Hung Action, so it releases its action under set circumstances.%0a%3c Add Fate (••): Instead of suspending an action entirely, the Mage may suspend only their success. The suspended action appears to happen, yet it looks like a failure (or, at the subject’s option, a dramatic failure—this does not grant a beat). When the spell ends, it turns out the action was a success the entire time.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The subject may hang one additional mundane action while this spell is active. This Reach may be selected multiple times.%0a%3c +2 Reach: This spell may apply to Extended Actions as well as Instant Actions.%0a%3c Stopwatch (Time ••••)%0a%3c Practice: Unraveling%0a%3c Primary Potency: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Resolve%0a%3c Cost: 1 Mana%0a%3c Suggested Rote Skills: Occult, Science, Intimidation%0a%3c The subject’s journey through time is slowed almost to the point of stopping. They attempt to do something, only to have the actions play out in slow motion as they are witnesses to their own body. To them the world moves with sudden, great speed. The subject’s Speed and Defense are reduced to 0. They declare their action at the beginning of the round, but it only takes place at the end of the round (in the order of the Mage’s choosing in the case of multiple subjects). Everyone else’s action coints as interrupting their action.%0a%3c +1 Reach: The subject suffers the Immobilized Tilt as the slowing of Time becomes that much more all encompassing.%0a%3c Weave The Tapestry (Time ••••)%0a%3c Mana Cost: None%0a%3c Practice: Patterning%0a%3c Primary Factor: Potency%0a%3c Withstand: Resolve%0a%3c A Mage may use this spell to guide the subject through multiple potential futures, ensuring that they pick what is best (or worst) for them. The Mage may cause the subject to reroll a number of mundane rolls equal to this spell’s potency. The mage chooses which rolls are rerolled, and whether to keep the old roll or use the new one. No dicepool may be rerolled more than once by this effect, even if another effect forces a reroll (in that case, you may perform a Clash of Wills to choose which roll to keep).%0a%3c +2 Reach: This spell may affect spellcasting rolls and supernatural rolls.%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Mortal/+%0a%3c Supernatural Merits%0a%3c Biomimicry Options%0a%3c The following can be chosen as purchase options by those with Biomimicry. The merit is still limited to 4 dots.%0a%3c %0a%3c Aquatic Adaptation: The Mimic gains the ability to breath underwater, as well as slightly webbed toes and fingers that give a +1 to both Speed when swimming and Swim rolls.%0a%3c Raptors Sight: The character’s eyes take on the sharpness of a bird of prey, removing up to 3 dice of penalties from perception rolls relying on sight.%0a%3c Pit Sensors: The Mimic gains a form of thermographic sensing, like those of the Viper family of snakes, becoming capable of ‘seeing’ via heat alone.%0a%3c Wall-Walking:From the spider to the lizard, to the ant and many things in between, gravity isn’t the end all be all. Maybe it’s tiny hairs, or sticky pads, but you have a knack for denying gravity by climbing up seemingly flat walls, and even hanging from ceiling.%0a%3c Run like a Gazelle: Maybe the length of your arms and legs shift to allow you to run on all fours, or maybe your knees bow backwards like a gazelles, but you have adapted for speed and mighty leaps! When running on all fours, add +4 to her Speed and double all jump distances. Like most Biomimicry additions, these changes are always fairly visible and obvious.%0a%3c Augmented Dexterity (••-••••)%0a%3c Public/Private: Public%0a%3c Prerequisites: Protocol at equal level%0a%3c Effect: At 2 dots this grants a +1 Dexterity boost, at 4 dots it grants a +2. This affects all derived traits. This can take your character above her normal Attribute limits.%0a%3c Deprived:’ You use your Dexterity for calculating Defence.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Beast’s Darling (•••)%0a%3c Public/Private: Private%0a%3c Prerequisites: Beast Whisperer%0a%3c Effect: Unlike the beloved merit, the vampire who finds their frenzy in your presence may have no feelings for you at all. But the beasts of the kindred have an instinctive fondness, a desire to protect you from themselves and maybe sometimes even from others. While you may not serve as a test of their detachment, you do serve as a balance to their frenzy. The beast is less inclined to frenzy in your presence, less willing to risk you, and if they do frenzy more likely to listen to you…….failing any of that you can always count on the fact, that at the very least, the beast will turn on you last…%0a%3c System wise kindred in your presence gain +2 to resist frenzy and if they fall into frenzy their blood potency is treated as if 2 lower, to a minimum of 1. For the expenditure of a WP a beast in the throes of frenzy, who isn’t already antagonistic you, will instinctively become protective of you.%0a%3c Drawback: There are few drawbacks as strong as a vampires grief. To wake from the frenzy and find friends, loved ones, torn assunder by the beast, and you still standing. It’s a quick way to draw the punishment of all those delightful stages of grief….in a very cold….dark….and lonely place, for many years or life times. If you have not soothed the beast before their frenzy finds their friends…..it might be best to stop trying and just go with the bloody flow.%0a%3c %0a%3c Unseen Sense, Advanced (•••)%0a%3c Prerequisite: Unseen Sense%0a%3c Effect: Your characters sixth sense for a type of supernatural creature is increased. By spending a point of Willpower she can extend the range of her unseen senses to 100 yards. As with Unseen Sense, the player can accept the Spooked Condition, in exchange for which the character can pinpoint where the feeling is coming from; this reveals all triggers of it within that range. If the target is using a power that specifically cloaks its supernatural nature, however, this does not work (though the Condition remains until resolved as usual), nor does it work against powers that use mental illusions to conceal or otherwise hide the character.%0a%3c %0a%3c Unseen Sense, Epic (•••)%0a%3c Prerequisite: Unseen Sense%0a%3c Effect: Your characters sixth sense is increased to detect any supernatural creature, and she is able to distinguish between them. As with Unseen Sense, Advanced, the player can accept the Spooked Condition, in exchange for which the character can pinpoint where the feeling is coming from; this reveals all triggers of it within that range. If the target is using a power that specifically cloaks its supernatural nature, however, this does not work (though the Condition remains until resolved as usual), nor does it work against powers that use mental illusions to conceal or otherwise hide the character.%0a%3c Velocity Drag (••)%0a%3c Public/Private: Public %0a%3c Prerequisites: Telekinetic Evasion %0a%3c Effect:While using Telekinesis to avoid a fist or a baseball bat is easy, what happens when someone comes at you with a pistol or shotgun? Being mortal means being able to die, but someone with the power of Telekinesis can learn to lessen the impact of ballistics on their body by creating a field of drag around them that bullets must pass through. While this effect has little notice on slow moving objects like melee weapons or brawling fists, high-velocity rounds are restricted in their speed or misdirected to less sensitive areas. Characters with this merit may spend an additional willpower for a scene to treat their dots in Telekinesis as Ballistic Armor, providing the same sort of defense against guns that mundane armor would. This armor protects against Armor Piercing tag as well. This can be applied in any scene where you have telekinesis active. %0a%3c Drawback: Firearms attacks made from weapons you wield while inside the protective barrier suffer from the same Ballistic armor against your opponents, the drag works both ways.%0a%3c %0a%3c Wired Reflexes (•• or ••••)%0a%3c Public/Private: Private%0a%3c Prerequisites: Protocol at Matching level%0a%3c Effect: This augmentation increases the speed at which the Lostboy’s body responds to threats of danger utilizing the users own subconscious reflexes to jerk them out of the way. At two dots, this translates to a +1 Defense, the fourth boosts the Defense by 2 instead.%0a%3c Deprived: No added bonus to Defense, At 2 dots May add half defense roundup vs Ranged Attacks, at 4 dots Full Defense vs Firearms.%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Vampire and Ghoul%0a%3c Devotions%0a%3c Arcane Sight (Auspex ••, Coil of Zirnitra •• OR Cruac ••)%0a%3c By aligning their Beast’s senses with the workings of magic and mystic energy instead of the secrets and weaknesses of their prey, the Kindred becomes able to study the weave of the supernatural. %0a%3c Private%0a%3c Cost: 1 Vitae%0a%3c Dice Pool: None%0a%3c Action: Instant%0a%3c Duration: 1 scene%0a%3c By spending a point of Vitae, the Kindred activates this power. At a glance, they become able to see any ‘active’ supernatural effect on a person, location, object, or area within range of their perceptions, seeing it as a sort of subtle ‘glow’. By focusing on such an effect, the Kindred may scrutinize the magic itself with Uncanny Perception or Spirit’s Touch (as appropriate), rolling as normal, but becoming able to ask questions directly related to supernatural effects. Some examples include, but are not limited to:%0a%3c %0a%3c Is this magic innate or external to the subject/object? A vision of a hooded figure casting a spell upon the subject. A glimpse of the target’s blood funneling into the effect.%0a%3c What sort of supernatural power is this? The smell of Vitae dripping from an open wound. The glowing Nimbus of the Mage who cast it. The feel of ectoplasm stringing itself around the skin.%0a%3c What does this effect do? The sight of a protective aura of force surrounding the subject. The creeping feeling of adoration for the power’s user.%0a%3c Was this effect created by someone whose effects I’ve studied before, and if so, who? ‘&#8201;’A vision of the target. An image of a Mage’s signature nimbus.”%0a%3c Noticing any effect meant to conceal, trick, or veil something in any way requires a Clash of Wills, though once already noticed, no Clash is required to scrutinize it with Auspex unless it specifically veils the nature of the information being sought out.%0a%3c This power costs 2 Experiences to learn.%0a%3c %0a%3c Cutting Words (Majesty •••, Vigor ••)%0a%3c A vampire with Majesty can make her target fall in love, fly into a rage, sink into depression, or die of a broken heart. With the right application of power, however, a vampire can make her victim feel as if her tongue is like a whip unto the flesh. To a truly devoted victim, though, these words are like jagged shards of glass as the vampire brings down the full force of her personality. %0a%3c Public/Private: Private%0a%3c Cost: 1 Vitae (or more, see below)%0a%3c Dice Pool: Presence + Intimidation/Subterfuge + Majesty - subject’s Resolve%0a%3c Action: Instant%0a%3c To use this Devotion, the target must be under the effects of a vampire’s Awe. The vampire must speak audibly so that the target can hear her. The words she uses determines the Skill to be rolled, Intimidation for insults and Subterfuge for veiled threats. Each success on the activation roll inflicts one bashing damage up to a maximum equal to her Majesty rating as the victim’s flesh mystically rips and tears. If the target has the Charmed Condition inflicted by the vampire, the Vampire may spend an extra Vitae to upgrade the damage to lethal (even to Vampires). Finally, if the target has the Enthralled Condition inflicted by the vampire, she does not subtract her Resolve from Cutting Words, and the Vampire may spend another Vitae to make the victim suffer the Insensate Tilt. In either case, the target resolves the related Condition immediately. %0a%3c This Devotion costs 2 Experiences to learn.%0a%3c %0a%3c Eyes of The Void (Auspex ••, Coil of Zirnitra ••)%0a%3c The Kindred develops their existing supernatural perception further, becoming able to see reality in a way far beyond what the mortal mind can typically process, building upon the simple omens and signs that psychics and sorcerers learn to pick up on, allowing them to dig a bit further into the reality behind it. This devotion is only of any use to a Kindred that, through Zirnitra or another means, is capable of using the Omen Sensitivity supernatural merit or an equivalent ability.%0a%3c Public/Private: Private%0a%3c Cost: 1 Vitae + 1 Willpower%0a%3c Dice Pool: Special%0a%3c Action: Extended%0a%3c Twice per story, the Kindred may use this Devotion to attempt go into a trance, momentarily seeing the Truth of the world as The Void does. The Vampire makes the usual extended roll for meditation; if successful, he may then activate Omen Sensitivity (or a similar power) normally. Upon receiving the answers to the questions, he may then ask an additional question regarding those answers per dot of Auspex, but these questions are not limited to those with yes/no answers; anything straightforward that can be answered with a few words or a short sentence can be asked. “Who is plotting to kill me?” is fine, for instance, but “What are the detailed plans of the one trying to kill me?” is not.%0a%3c Drawback: Opening oneself up to the undercurrents of the multiverse is dangerous to those with a material mind. In addition to Omen Sensitivity’s normal drawback, the Kindred suffers the Tainted condition, representing not a consumed soul but a piece of the otherworld seeping inside them. Treat this as if the ‘victim’ was a Blood Potency 2 character. This does not make the user appear as a Diablerist to Auspex and other powers.%0a%3c This power costs 2 Experiences to learn.%0a%3c %0a%3c Deconstruct (Auspex 2)%0a%3c Private %0a%3c Provided with a sample of a substance, no matter how complex, the vampire can break it down to it’s base part to better understand it’s composition. The sample is destroyed in the process but the Kindred can determine all sorts of information regarding the sample.%0a%3c %0a%3c Cost: 1 Vitae %0a%3c Dice Pool: Intelligence + (Occult or Science) + Auspex %0a%3c Action: Instant. Use of the power requires one hour and some basic equipment %0a%3c %0a%3c The Kindred can ask one question per successes on the roll related the nature of the sample, for example;%0a%3c %0a%3c Where was this created?%0a%3c How long ago was this created?%0a%3c Do I know who this sample came from (and who if they do)?%0a%3c What is the samples purity and what are it’s impurities?%0a%3c (The original Sanguinary Analysis power found in Ancient Bloodlines has more examples)%0a%3c %0a%3c Dramatic Failure: The Vampire gains a false answer unknowingly.%0a%3c Failure: The procedure fails.%0a%3c Success: The Vampire gains one question per success.%0a%3c Dramatic Success: The Geheim gains an additional question or gains greater insight into a previously asked question at the Storyteller’s whim. %0a%3c Possible Modifiers%0a%3c %0a%3c Fresh or Pure Sample +1 to 3%0a%3c Ample Sample +1%0a%3c Damaged or Tainted Sample &#8722;1 to &#8722;3%0a%3c Strange or Unique &#8722;1 to &#8722;3%0a%3c Does Not Possess Specialty: Occult (Alchemy) &#8722;5%0a%3c Appropriate Library Merit +1 to +3%0a%3c %0a%3c This Devotion costs 1 Experiences to learn.%0a%3c %0a%3c Sorcerous Occlusion (Obfuscate 2, Coil of Zirnitra 2)%0a%3c Public/Private: Private%0a%3c Rather than occluding the Kindred’s form, he weaves his expertise in going unnoticed into the very supernatural power born from and surrounding him. It escapes the senses of others’ Beasts and hides him from the attention of the more over-curious denizens of the supernatural world.%0a%3c Cost: Special%0a%3c Dice Pool: Special%0a%3c Duration: Indefinite/1 scene.%0a%3c Action: Instant%0a%3c At-will, the Kindred can cause his supernatural abilities and those affecting him to become difficult to sense. For as long as it lasts (it can be deactivated at will), any supernatural affecting him, or that he uses, is ‘cloaked’, making it so “passive” senses like Peripheral Mage Sight and reflexive uses of Kenning will not be triggered by it. Active supernatural senses require a Clash of Wills to notice, study, or otherwise learn about or via any such abilities, and if the Clash of Wills is lost, the same ability can not be used to detect that specific power for the rest of the scene. As well, the Kindred gains 8-again on their own Clash, given the focused purpose of the power being used.%0a%3c By spending a point of Vitae, the Sorcerer can roll the normal dice pool for Touch of Shadow to extend this occlusion to another; for the rest of the night, they gain the same benefits, using the Kindred’s clash of wills.%0a%3c This Devotion costs 2 Experiences to learn.%0a%3c %0a%3c Spider Sense (Celerity •••, Auspex •• )%0a%3c Named after the signature ability of the Comic Book Character Peter Parker, Spider Sense works much the same way as the hero’s namesake. Whenever something occurs that would target the character, there is a momentary sense of danger that presents itself through the beast. While the specifics of the ‘what’ or ‘how’ may be lost on the character, the first few moments of danger seem to slow to a crawl, giving him plenty of time to assess the situation and prepare for the worst case scenario and prepare himself for incoming physical threats, or in the case of mental influences, hopefully react quickly enough to shut their opponent down. %0a%3c Private%0a%3c Cost: 1 Vitae %0a%3c Dice Pool: None %0a%3c Action: Reflexive %0a%3c You may activate Spider Sense any time your character would suffer an attack or detrimental effect, though this is most often used against attacks that the Kindred is unaware of, it may be used at any time. The power is exhausting, however, and may only be activate as many times per scene as the Kindred has dots in Celerity. The blood is spent reflexively, and may be spent even when the character has failed a roll to notice a surprise attack. %0a%3c When activated against a physical threat, the Kindred may either expend one use of this power to treat their failed ambush check as if it had scored one higher than the attackers, or if used against an attack the Kindred knows is coming, may reduce the number of successes rolled against them by their celerity rating. %0a%3c This devotion can not be applied to mental or social powers, but if this power is activated during any round where an opponent declares a hostile action against them they may use the active power of interrupting an opponents action at no cost, so long as it’s used to attempt to interrupt the activation of the power.%0a%3c %0a%3c Uncanny Periphery (Auspex 2, Coil of Zirnitra 1)%0a%3c Public/Private: Private%0a%3c The Kindred’s Uncanny Perception becomes more active, providing hints of the unknown and glimpses of nearby magic to the Kindred at all times. He no longer needs to actively seek out the secret powers of others; he simply needs to be closeby enough to catch their scent. %0a%3c Cost: None/Special%0a%3c Dice Pool: Wits + Occult + Auspex%0a%3c Action: Reflexive%0a%3c Whenever a supernatural power is about to be used nearby the Kindred (within range of his Kindred Sense of smell), this Devotion is reflexively activated. On a success, the Beast provides minor sensory cues as to the nature and origin of the capability (whispered reflections of his own thoughts originating from the user, in the case of someone reading his mind, for instance). This happens with enough notice to allow a reflexive power of his own to be activated first (including using Celerity to pre-empt it), or for Willpower or Vitae to be spent to boost his resistance against the ability. %0a%3c In the case of powers meant to mislead or conceal, a Clash of Wills is made instead of the normal roll; if the Kindred wins, he gets a sense of a power being used nearby, but is not shown the actual origin or nature of it (he can still boost his defenses if paranoid enough, however). This is more taxing, however; after the first such Clash in a scene, additional ones draw a point of Vitae from the Kindred’s reserves as the beast subconsciously tires (and this is not immediately noticed if the Clash fails). The Kindred may reflexively suppress the ability to sense these more subtle powers, however, to preserve Vitae. %0a%3c This Devotion costs 2 Experiences to learn.%0a%3c %0a%3c False Vision (Obfuscate 4)%0a%3c Public/Private: Private %0a%3c The vampires Beast confunds any who try and pry into it’s soul for answers placing false truths for seekers to findCost: 2 Vitae %0a%3c Dice Pool: Wits + Subterfuge + Obfuscate %0a%3c Action: Instant %0a%3c Duration: One Scene’%0a%3c The vampire shrouds their soul against supernatural attempts to discern information about them through supernatural means. This only applies to direct attempts against them such as most Auspex power or similar powers that read thoughts and similar information. It doesn’t not protect against powers such as scrying. Whenever someone attempts to discern information about the vampire through supernatural means if this power is active it provokes a clash of wills against the offending power. If the vampire wins he can either have them learn nothing or fabricate a false truth. For each piece of false information they fabricate costs the vampire 1 vitae. %0a%3c This Devotion costs 2 Experiences to learn.%0a%3c %0a%3c Spitting In The Beast’s Eye (Obfuscate 2, Majesty 1 or Nightmare 1)%0a%3c Public/Private: Private The vampire’s Beast is naturally hides itself away from scrutiny and with this discipline it does so against even supernatural means even lashing out against those that pry to closely. %0a%3c Cost: None %0a%3c Dice Pool: None’ %0a%3c Action: Reflexive %0a%3c The vampire always enjoys the basic protection of this devotion which protects them against supernatural attempts to scrutinize them and learn they’re secrets. This powers works against powers like Auspex and many mage spells of the Practice of Knowing. It applies a penalty equal to the vampires Majesty discipline.%0a%3c If the vampire has their Awe power active when someone attempts to use their powers that this devotion protects against they gain a bonus to their Majesty discipline rolls against the user of the power. The bonus is equal to the aggressor dots in Auspex or relevant power. Each time they use these bonus dice it costs 1 Vitae. The benefit lasts for the rest of the scene. %0a%3c A similar devotion exists that uses Nightmare. If the vampire is using Dread Presence they gain the secondary bonus from this Devotion. %0a%3c This Devotion costs 2 Experiences to learn.%0a%3c %0a%3c Miracles%0a%3c Stone of Antipas ••%0a%3c Public/Private: Private %0a%3c Target Number of Successes: 7 %0a%3c The sorcerer prepares a burning hot stone or ball made of brass which is the sacrament for this miracle.The ritual draws on the story of Saint Antipas who died for his faith in the bowels of a bronze bull.%0a%3c The recipent then ingests the effigy and spends the next few minutes in agony as their innards sizzle and burn. This deals the subject one lethal damage (even to Kindred). So long as the enchanted effigy remains in their stomach and up to the sorcerer’s dots in Theban nights the subject’s faith is bolstered and they can withstand any hardship. They gain a number of dots equal to the caster’s Theban Sorcery in Stamina or Composure divided however they wish. The ritual ends immediately if the damage from the ritual is healed. If for some reason it’s wanted, it’s possible for the ritual to deal additional damage to the subject allowing the power to last longer, especially in mortals. (This might happen if they are fast healers for example.)%0a%3c %0a%3c Wings of the Seraph •••%0a%3c    Public/Private: Private %0a%3c     Target Number of Successes: 10 %0a%3c     Contested/Resisted by: None %0a%3c %0a%3c A miracle known by few whose origins are almost completely lost to the sands of time it still see’s use by a few sorcerers to this day. A religious icon is prepared, usually one depicting protection by the ritualist. He then annoints a supplicant with a tattoo linking the icon and tattoo. From the next month the one holding the icon may break it, if they do the tattooed individual switches places with the one who broke the icon.%0a%3c %0a%3c The one bearing the tattoo must agree to wear it and not be made to do so under magical compulsion. Torture or normal coercion doesn’t seem to effect this miracle.%0a%3c %0a%3c Oaths%0a%3c %0a%3c Oath of the Agent (••••) %0a%3c The Conspiracy of Silence is so named because they are an agency with secrets, and those secrets must be kept by any means. This often requires agents on the field who can serve a number of functions from destroying evidence, murdering witness, manipulating the media, to making effective threats. Those who act in the agency of the Invictus find their status within the Covenant empowers them in the actions required to perform their duties.This Oath can only be taken once, and not by anyone who suffers an existing blood bond to someone lacking Invictus Status. There can be no chance that the Agent will share their secrets with those outside of the status.\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Effect: When serving the Invictus and their interests, the character who takes this oath may add their Status as Skill dots on a one for one basis to skills that are represent the task at hand. This can not break the cap allowed by their blood potency, nor can they add more than two dots to any one skill. This bonus may be changed, but only once per chapter. As an added benefit, when the character is dealing with mortals for the purposes of cleaning up a Masquerade breach, she may add her dots in status as an equipment bonus to social rolls. This stacks with other equipment, but may not exceed the 5 dot limit.%0a%3c %0a%3c Drawback: If the Character who purchases this oath ever betrays the Secrets of the Invictus (Whether it is Masquerade Breaches themselves or Political Ambitions) they suffer an obvious source of Aggravated damage that represents their crime. Speaking secrets may burn away their tongue, turning it to ash in their mouth. Considering the tempting words of an enemy may burn away your ears leaving you deaf, and witnessing a crime against the Invictus but not taking action may cause your eyes to burst into flame. Mark your left most health box with aggravated damage and take an appropriate tilt that will not be resolved until you heal the appropriate damage. If you have other sources of aggravated damage, they must always be healed first. Any time you expect to gain the benefits of this oath, the highest ranking member of the Invictus will always know, and expect the appropriate paperwork to be filed. //%0a%3c %0a%3c Protean Modifications%0a%3c Predatory Aspects%0a%3c Camouflage: By altering her skin tone and even her clothes to blend into her surroundings, the Kindred becomes more difficult to notice, granting a bonus to rolls to go unnoticed equal to her Protean dots.%0a%3c Projectile Blood: Spitting blood like a Cobra, the Kindred can temporarily render their opponents blind. Spend 1 additional Vitae beyond the activation cost of this power, the Vitae is expelled from the Kindreds mouth up to a distance of Strength x 3 yards. Roll Dexterity + Athletics - Defense, with the usual targeted attack penalty, but reduce this penalty by the character’s Protean dots. Success inflicts the Blind tilt on the opponent. The tilt is resolved if the victim of this power spends an Instant action wiping away the viscous fluid. Vitae so expelled from the body is considered inert, and does not cause Vitae Addiction or any increase in the steps of a Blood Bond.%0a%3c Rodent’s Anatomy: Much like a Mouse or Rat caught in a Predators grasp, you know just how to move and wiggle to make an escape. If you have this power activated while in a grapple, you may add your dots in Protean to any roll to Break Free or Escape an Immobilize. Dots granted by this power may not be applied to Take Down, Damage, or the Disarm Maneuver. This power may allow the Kindred to attempt to escape an Immobilize caused by an item such as a Zip Tie or Handcuffs, make a Dexterity + Athletics roll with a penalty depending on how advanced the equipment is. Standard Rope levies a &#8722;1 penalty while Police Issue Handcuffs impose a &#8722;3. Success frees the character from the restraint.%0a%3c Venom: The Kindred can produce powerful venom glands, like a spider or a snake, that they may excrete when they bite someone or hit them with a natural weapon granted by Protean. This counts as a Poison with a Toxicity equal to the Kindred’s Protean dots. In combat it inflicts the (Moderate) Poison Tilt.%0a%3c Wolf’s Hide: Adapting his flesh to that of a Predatory Animal like a Wolf or Lion, the Kindred becomes unnaturally resilient to damage. He enjoys an armor rating of 2/0 against any bashing attacks and a rating of 1/0 against incoming lethal damage. This armor does not apply to banes that the Kindred suffers from, but stacks with any armor worn.%0a%3c Unnatural Aspects%0a%3c Long Death: The Kindred produces a powerful hemotoxin as the Beast devours the subject’s blood from within them. This poison is delivered through the Kindred’s bite, or through any natural weapons created by Protean. This poison deals Lethal damage and has a Toxicity of their Blood Potency. The damage happens once per hour up to Protean times, but never during the day. In Combat this prouces the (Grave) Poison Tilt, except that the victim takes a penalty to their Stamina + Resolve roll each turn equal to the Kindred’s Protean. Vampire victims lose Vitae instead of taking damage while Ghouls lose Vitae before health levels.%0a%3c Monstrous Hide: The Kindred transmutes their bones and flesh, forming layers of tough leathery skin, carapace, or other natural armor. This counts as 3/5 armor with a &#8722;2 penalty to defense and a &#8722;1 penalty to speed, which does not stack with other armor (but note Resilience is NOT armor).%0a%3c Noxious Miasma: The Kindred transmutes their body until it is like an open sepulcher from which the death and decay of every feeding spill forth. Those who come within Protean*2 yards of the Kindred gain the (Grave) Sick tilt as the Beast-tainted stench causes their bodies to heave, vomit, and convulse. This aspect affects vampires despite their normal immunity to disease and lack of breathing, though the tilt may be ‘healed’ normally. It may affect other supernaturals normally immune to disease with a Clash of Wills. If a character has a supernaturally augmented sense of smell, the effective range doubles against them.%0a%3c Rituals%0a%3c Dolls Pretty Bath (Cruac ••)%0a%3c Public/Private: Private Successes required: 5%0a%3c %0a%3c The cruac user prepares a bath spilling the blood for the ritual into the water, mixed with perfumes and salts, invoking goddesses of beauty and youth sings magic into the bath. When the target emerges they receive the benefits of Striking Appearance 2 (doll-like beauty) for a number of nights equal to the users dots in Cruac. This is able to stack with existing Striking Appearance scores.%0a%3c %0a%3c One person may receive the benefits of each casting no matter how large the bathing vessel is%0a%3c %0a%3c Arms Of The Abyss (Cruac ••••)%0a%3c Public/Private: Private (Open to Kalikula members)%0a%3c Target Successes: 7%0a%3c The ritualist sends out a call to a shadowy Abyss for assistance, and as the ritual’s completed, they can feel its energy seeping into them, ready to be unleashed. At any point in the same night the ritual is completed, they may summon forth a number of tendrils of living tangible darkness equal to their Cruac rating, which act to aid them.%0a%3c Once per turn, the ritualist may reflexively give a single, straightforward and simple command to an arm, such as ‘Attack combatant X’, ‘Immobilize X combatant’, or ‘Prevent object X from falling over’. They will continue to perform this exact same action until ordered to perform another or until the action becomes impossible (in which case they will still await a new order). The semi-corporeal arms act with a dicepool equal to the caster’s Cruac rating + Potency (limit Cruac x 2) for anything that requires a roll, and can be dispelled at the will of the summoner or any successful attack targeting an arm (if attacked they have 2 defense and no armor). If a raw attribute score matters, treat their Strength or Dexterity as similarly equal to the caster’s Cruac rating.%0a%3c Among being dextrous and strong, the arms carry a venom-like magical touch that overwhelms a living targets senses with the raw power of their touch. In the turn a living being is touched by an arm they gain the Insensate tilt, which fades after 1 turn. This tilt may be re-applied with additional touches later. The practitioner of the ritual is immune to this if somehow they themself are alive, such as with Ghouls.%0a%3c %0a%3c Scales%0a%3c Calm Before The Storm%0a%3c Prerequisite Coil: Leash the Beast (Wyrm)%0a%3c Public/Private: Public%0a%3c Procedure: The Vampire has found the exact part of him that the beast controls, that part of his brain where rage is contained and released, and he has learned to create a concoction that affects this part of the Kindred mind. %0a%3c The mixture of blood, which requires at least a small amount of werewolf blood, takes a half hour to mix properly, and when consumed gives the imbiber the ability to remain lucid even while under the effects of frenzy.%0a%3c Outcome: The concoction both strengthens and controls the Dragon’s beast. For the rest of the night, his social rolls are capped by his Humanity (or effective Humanity with regards to Social rolls, if this differs). However, when the Kindred is next provoked to frenzy within that same night, he may spend a willpower and attempt to Ride the Wave. If successful, he remains lucid during his frenzy. He still gains all the benefits of the Frenzy, but is not compelled to sate the beasts desires. If he does choose to do so, the Frenzy ends immediately, otherwise the effects of frenzy end after one scene. If the substance isn’t consumed immediately, the Kindred may store it indefinitely, but may only have a number of the potions ‘active’ equal to his Blood Potency.%0a%3c Bodhi%0a%3c Prerequisite Coil: The Dragon’s Breath (Zirnitra ••••)%0a%3c Additional Prerequisite: Fuel the Fire%0a%3c Public/Private: Private%0a%3c Description: Through the use of a prepared wine bottle the Dragon’s able to store Essence within creating a uniquely flavored vintage.%0a%3c Procedure: The Dragons mixes an alchemical compound meant to function as a transmutation catalyst. He then hooks himself up to a dialysis machine and activates the Blush of Life. While the machine circulates his Vitae he ingests the alchemical mixture, then drinks the wine and lets it circulate within his own system. %0a%3c While the process takes place the Dragon concentrates and slips into a deep meditation letting his body become the mixing apparatus. The Essence (gained via Fuel The Fire) within him functions as a filter as the process completes its cycle.%0a%3c Finally placing a needle through the cork of the wine bottle and placing the liquid once more into the vessel. As the Essence seeps into the bottle it slightly alters the vintage inside creating not only a flavorful substance that can be consumed by Kindred but giving the vintage the capability to hold onto the Essence and store it.%0a%3c Outcome: The bottle of wine, once properly prepared by the Dragon, may now become a storage vessel for Essence, being able to store up to a total of the Dragons dots in Zirnitra.%0a%3c The Essence stored within the Wine imbues it with a “flavor” based upon the Resonance or source of the Essence. %0a%3c The Essence may be drawn out of the wine in order to fuel abilities or powers that harness such energies, though doing so ruins the vintage and it may not be used again for the purpose of this Scale.%0a%3c Draw Back: The concoction, once consumed, creates a sense of euphoria in the drinker. This feeling can be so intense that it causes addiction. Just like Blood Addiction the drinker must make the associated roll for addition if failed he/she now suffers from the Addiction Condition as he/she becomes consumed with a need to relive that one brief moment, forever chasing after it.%0a%3c %0a%3c Bounty of the Wyre%0a%3c Prerequisite Coil: The Dragon’s Breath (Zirnitra ••••)%0a%3c Additional Prerequisites: Scale-Fuel the Fire%0a%3c After having spent much time bonding and attuning to his Nest the Dragon now has a much deeper understanding of its purpose within the world. This understanding comes when the Dragon has a connection with the Resonance of the Nest. Due to the Dragons strong connection to the Nest he may act as a vector of these energies thus allowing him to grant this ability to those closest to him, by sharing this knowledge.%0a%3c Procedure:’ The Dragon follows the process of the Scale Fuel the Fire, but must deepen his understanding even further by giving part of himself to the Nest in exchange for such bountiful knowledge of its being. The Dragon takes 1 unavoidable point of aggravated DMG per point of the Nest and must spend a point of Willpower in equal amounts.%0a%3c Outcome: Rolls pertaining to the Resonance of the Nest now gain a dice trick quality depending on the strength of the Nest, if fueled with the Nest’s energy. This bonus is only applicable to such tasks that fall within the quality of the Resonance of the Nest utilized for this Scale. %0a%3c &#8594;1 - 9 again%0a%3c &#8594;3 – 8 again%0a%3c &#8594;5 – Rolls become exceptional on 3 successes rather than 5%0a%3c The use of such knowledge can be straining on the mind and due to the amount of focus it takes to use the ability of the Scale it must be feed with energy from its source; 1 energy gained from the Nest via the Prerequisite Scale or otherwise must be spent per roll by someone ‘attuned’ to it somehow.%0a%3c Drawback: The use of this Scale is only possible so long as the vector Dragon carries within himself a small portion of the resonance from the Nest.%0a%3c %0a%3c Chemical Lobotomy%0a%3c Public/Private: Private%0a%3c Prerequisite Coil: The Dragon’s Breath (Zirnitra ••••)%0a%3c Procedure: While present at a Wyrm’s Nest, the Dragon mixes various neurotoxic substances together with a few drops of Vitae, and a small amount of spinal fluid, and the substance is then brought up to a boil. The mixture must be rapidly combined and continually stirred or otherwise mixed until it cools, and then is immediately either consumed or stored in a specially prepared, sealed glass vial. %0a%3c Outcome: If not immediately consumed, the substance will last up to a day per dot of the Kindred’s Blood Potency after the fact, before it goes inert. When imbibed, however, the horrible substance immediately goes to work, stimulating and burning away a small portion of the victim’s mind. For those susceptible to neurotoxins, this is a Toxicity 5 substance, and whether susceptible to the toxin or not, the consumer loses a dot of a Mental or Social attribute (player’s choice) which ‘heals’ like aggravated damage, and suffers the Confused Condition until it’s healed, as the substance physically assaults their mind.%0a%3c At that point, however, all other mundane mental conditions and tilts are immediately removed from the character (whether positive or negative), not counting as resolved, and the Dragon then makes a Clash of Wills against any mental supernatural effect or condition affecting the character as well; he rolls Blood Potency + Coil of Zirnitra. By spending an extra point of Vitae during the substance’s creation, the Zirnitra rating is doubled for the Clash dice pool. Unlike the mundane conditions, only hostile or negative supernatural effects are targeted by the substance, per the judgment of the Dragon. %0a%3c This will not remove the Blood Bond or similar inherently ‘template’ abilities.%0a%3c %0a%3c Dragon Bile%0a%3c Prerequisite Coil: (Wyrm) •••••%0a%3c Public/Private: Private%0a%3c Procedure: The Kindred mixes an alchemical compound and infuses his own blood into it as a means to house the Beast. Then the procedure of placing the essence of his Beast in the concoction creates a balm of a uniquely Toxic Hemo-caustic nature.Of course the most difficult part of the process is extracting the needed vitae from the Kindred while he is in Frenzy. This is a necessity as it’s only during this point that he is at the peak of being one with the internal monster, thus being able to draw on the essence of the enraged inner self.%0a%3c Outcome: The Beast infused Hemo-caustic substance burns through the blood of the target devouring it from within causing as a Toxicity 5 poison.%0a%3c Once absorbed through the skin or mucus membrane, even entry via a wound, the Beast does as it always has and will hunt, devour, and destroy them from the inside out as it destroys their blood in a frenzy.%0a%3c In Kindred the effect is even more violent as it destroys Vitae as well equal to the Toxicity of the poison.%0a%3c Unlike most Hemo Toxins this one is of a rare nature, rather than a Kindred being able to burn the poison from its system with Vitae he must Lash Out against the Beast that is attempting to destroy him from the inside out in order to drive it from his system, beating a dice pool equal to the Toxicity.%0a%3c If not stopped, the poison causes the Poisoned Tilt in combat or damage outside of combat with the normal systems, even to Kindred.%0a%3c Drawback: As stated in the procedure the need of Vitae from a Kindred in Frenzy is in and of itself this is a very dangerous endeavor that could lead to the loss of more than one life.%0a%3c %0a%3c Empower the Lingering Spark%0a%3c Public/Private: Private%0a%3c Prerequisite Coil: The Dragon’s Breath (Zirnitra 4)%0a%3c Procedure: A piece of tangible supernatural equipment (per GMC or the Free Rules Update pg 241) is prepared with a mixture of the Dragon’s Vitae (at least 3 points), dust and other miscellanea from the Nest it’s performed at (it only works at a Nest), and purified water that’s been kept at at least 3 different Ley Line Nodes for an hour or more, the mixture of which is cooked together and then poured over the object in a pattern that aligns with the energy flow of the Nest itself. %0a%3c Outcome: The Nest’s energy is used to empower the supernatural object, flooding into it and supercharging its ability to affect the wider world. Its equipment bonus (or any similar numerical bonus it applies) is raised by up to half the Dragon’s rating in the Coil of Zirnitra, rounded up, and this CAN bring it above the maximum equipment bonus. This increase lasts for a number of Nights equal to the Nest’s rating by default, but if purchased as an Enhanced Item (per the merit in Mage the Awakening, but ONLY for raised equipment bonus), either by the Kindred or an intended recipient (they’re effectively ‘written into’ the ritual), it will last permanently.%0a%3c %0a%3c Fuel the Fire%0a%3c Prerequisite Coil: Ascendancy (The Coil of Zirnitra)%0a%3c Additional Perquisite: Nest Guardian and Safe Place at 1+%0a%3c In order for the Dragon to become as close as he needs to be with the Nest for this Scale to work he must have a functioning bond with the location.%0a%3c Public/Private: Private%0a%3c By tapping into the mystic powers of a Wyrms Nest itself the Dragon has learned to utilize those energizes there in and harness them to fuel his own supernal powers. After a successful meditation on the Wyrms Nest itself the Dragon can then tap into its source energy: Essence for a Locus, Mana for a Hallow.%0a%3c Procedure: In order to tap into the source energy of the Nest the Kindred must meditate at the Nest itself. Sometimes this can take several hours depending on how apt the Dragon is with the art of Meditation. Once the Dragons mind has been cleared of all distractions he then attunes himself to the Wyrms Nest (This procedure has to be done at least once a month in order for the Dragon to maintain his connection to the Wyrms Nest)%0a%3c Once the Dragon has completed the task of attuning himself to the Wyrms Nest he can feel the flow of the mystic energies as he himself becomes connected to it. This deep connection then allows the Dragon to pull forth a portion of those energies that make up the Nest and fuse them with him. The task of the fusing this supernal fuel into himself is completed by drawing these energies into himself and infusing his being with them.%0a%3c The Dragon may only pull out energy equal to the rank or rate of the Nest itself to a maximum of five, and no more than one time per nest per chapter. This is a near intimate connection between Dragon and Wyrms Nest and so the resonance of the Nest always manifests itself in some physical way.%0a%3c Outcome: Once the Dragon has attuned himself to the Nest he may then draw out the supernal power that builds up in the Nest and use it in a variety of ways.%0a%3c 1) The Dragon may use the source energy to fuel his own abilities as if it where Vitae (and it’s capped the same way)%0a%3c 2) The Dragon may pass the energy to other Kindred on a 1 for 2 ratio.%0a%3c 3) Due to the Dragons attunement to the Nest he may now sense its well being. Like a gardener caring for his prized rose bush, anything effecting the Nest directly such as it being damaged, drained of its supernal energies or actions affecting its resonance now react in such a way that the Dragon not only knows but feels what is happening.%0a%3c At the end of the month any supernal fuel not used bleeds away from the Kindred and is wasted.%0a%3c Drawback: Any failure is automatically a dramatic failure. A new meditation roll is made in such a case, and Successes indicate the amount of Vitae that is sapped from the Dragon and pulled into the Nest itself. This amount of blood loss can exceed the normal maximum of five. As well due to the ripping of blood from the Dragon he takes one lethal damage per point of blood lost in this manner. As well this upsetting of the balance with the Nest leaves the Dragon unable to attune to the Wyrms Nest for the following month.%0a%3c In addition, multiple Dragons may not use this on the same Nest in the same night; the second Dragon to attempt to do so automatically suffers a dramatic failure, as above.%0a%3c Gift of the Mind%0a%3c Prerequisite Coil: Embolden Potential (Zirnitra)%0a%3c Public/Private: Public%0a%3c Procedure: Through the study of psychic phenomena the Kindred has learned what areas within his own mind unlock various Psychic abilities, and through use of his research has learned to blend a mixture of his own cerebral fluids with other occult herbs and his own blood.%0a%3c This serum takes several hours to create due to its nature. The Kindred must first pin point what Psychic ability he wishes to gain accesses to. Then he must extract fluid from that part of his own brain in order to capture the Epigenetic information. The extraction process is extremely painful as it requires the use of medical tools being inserted into the brain by the Kindred using the Process. (Take 1 unavoidable point of aggravated damage)%0a%3c Once the extraction has been completed the Kindred then creates the Substrate that the fluid is placed into. His own Vitae (rendered unable to create the Bond or Addiction) in combination with a variety of arcane herbs now function as the substrate material in which the cerebral fluid will carry along the Epigenetic Psychic Data to the imbiber.%0a%3c Outcome: The serum can now be imbibed by another to temporarily allow them to utilize the selected Psychic ability. Once ingested the ability is only available for one scene as the materials brake down in the imbibers system. The substance degrades after a month; if not used by that point, it becomes useless.%0a%3c Drawback: Since the serum temporarily rewires and rewrites the imbibers own brain chemistry in order to give them the Psychic ability it causes a bit of disorientation and one hell of a headache. As a means to lessen these effects a Point of Willpower must be spent and a reflexive Stamina + Resolve roll is made. If failed the imbiber suffers from the Drugged Condition for the remainder of the scene regardless of the spent Willpower. (The Willpower does not add the standard bonus to a roll)%0a%3c (Note: all costs such as Willpower and or use of Vitae to activate the psychic power still have to be utilized during the Extraction process or the serum does not work)%0a%3c %0a%3c Harmonize%0a%3c Public/Private: Private%0a%3c Prerequisite Coil: Ascendancy (Zirnitra 5) %0a%3c Procedure: The Dragon lets set the crystal/gem/precious stone in a highly caustic alchemical mixture over a period of 24 hours giving it time to be absorbed into the crystal/gem/precious stone making the substance inert.%0a%3c He then lets the crystal/gem/precious stone once again soak over a 24 hour period; this time in his own Vitae or the Vitae of the Dragon whom the harmonizing is being performed for.%0a%3c After the crystal/gem/precious stone has yet again soaked it must be placed within the confines of the Nest itself where it will rest its final 24 hours gathering the resonance of the Nest to complete the process of harmonizing.%0a%3c Once the Harmonizing process has been completed the Dragon is ready to awaken the powers within by making a Wits + Occult activation roll.%0a%3c Outcome: Once the Harmonizing process has been completed the Dragon awakens the powers within by making a Wits + Occult activation roll. The Pseudo Nest will then be active for use for a period of day’s equal to success on the roll. The Dragon creates a crystal/gem/precious stone that resonates on the same level as the Nest. This gives the Dragon the ability to use the crystal/gem/precious stone in place of the Nest for instances of Scale usage giving the Dragon more mobility for use of Scales that require a Nest. Harmonize ONLY functions for the use of Scales that DO NOT affect a Nest directly. ‘&#8201;’&#8201;‘Drawback: The crystal/gem/precious stone only has a usage span equal to the days in successes before going inert and having to be redone. %0a%3c As with other Scales, vectoring supernatural energies has a physical toll on the Dragon. For each level of Nest rating he takes one unavoidable point of LETHAL damage during the creation and Harmonizing process.%0a%3c Imprinting- the Nest Crystal will only function for the Dragon whose Vitae was used in the harmonizing.%0a%3c %0a%3c Preserve the Crimson Vial%0a%3c Prerequisite Coil: Into the Fold (Voivode)%0a%3c Public/Private: Private%0a%3c Procedure: With a mix of imparting part of the Kindreds will and a concoction of Alchemical Agents, the Kindred is able to preserve the nutritional qualities of blood. The blood may be kept in an object that is hermetically sealed and at least large enough to hold one pint of liquid. While this lengthens the time in which Blood or Vitae may be used for consumption, it is not indefinite. All blood goes bad, but the reagents used to preserve the potency of the blood do at the very least extend this life, using the power of the Kindreds beast as a medium%0a%3c Outcome: The object can hold up to (Blood Potency+Coil of Voivode) traits of Blood or Vitae, though the power of the Potency of the Kindreds Vitae condenses the sheer amount of blood down to the size of about a pint. The amount of blood that is used in the ritual must be equal to the blood taken from however many subjects take part in the process. Each willpower spent can either extend the life of the Blood or Vitae by an additional week, or it can add to the storage capacity of the container (minimum of 1, spent on duration). Mortals with the Producer Merit grant double the benefit of the stored blood, as per the merit. Also, Kindred Vitae so stored causes Bonding as per normal, but does not cause Vitae addiction.%0a%3c %0a%3c Sanguine Empowerment%0a%3c Prerequisite Coil: Embolden Potential (Zirnitra)%0a%3c Public/Private: Private%0a%3c Procedure: The procedure requires the bone of a creature that had some sort of supernatural power to it in life, whether a ghouled animal, mortal with a supernatural merit, werewolf, or otherwise. The bone is ground into a fine powder (or sludge, depending on its age), and then mixed with a pint or so of human blood. The Subject, who must be a Kindred (and can be the Dragon), then consumes the paste that results, using the Blush of Life to be sure he can hold it down for at least an hour. Within that time period, the paste is ‘digested’ and absorbed, rather than being vomited up at the end.%0a%3c Outcome: The unnatural remnant of power is absorbed by the Kindred, providing a bonus to his own supernatural potency. For the sake of any dice pools involving Blood Potency, the Kindred adds the Dragon’s dots in the Coil of Zirnitra (minimum of 1), though this doesn’t affect anything relying on the rating instead of a direct roll (such as Sunlight damage, derived frenzy bonuses, or maximum Attributes); for instance, contesting a Discipline, a Clash of Wills, or Lashing out are all affected.%0a%3c The effects of the Scale last for the following week. The Kindred may only have a number of ‘active’ uses of the Scale at any one time equal to his Blood Potency; any additional uses of the Procedure before another fades simply fails.%0a%3c %0a%3c Subsuming the Aura%0a%3c Prerequisite Scale: Embolden Potential (Zirnitra)%0a%3c Public/Private: Public%0a%3c Cost: Invest 1 WP; 1 Vitae per dot of power in addition to paying 1wp and 1 vitae for using any energy source you lack.%0a%3c Procedure: The Dragon must extract a sample from either the eye or the brain of someone who has been affected by a supernatural power within the last week. Through distilling this fluid through the vitae the Dragon may temporarily claim that power as their own. This power must be performed on a Wyrm’s Nest.%0a%3c Outcome: The Dragon must invest a point of Willpower and a point of Vitae per dot of the power she wishes to subsume for her own use in addition to whatever typical costs the power use would incur. If the subject survives the surgery they take one willpower of damage per dot of power subsumed by the Vampire. Any conditions connected to the power’s originator may also be shed, however, this require a Clash of Wills against the power’s original owner. If this Clash of Wills fails, the whole Scale will fail. If successful, however, the subject may shed all of their related conditions for an additional willpower damage. If the subject would be reduced to 0 willpower through use of this Scale, they instead remain at WP 1 and instead gain the condition “Soul Shocked” so long as the Dragon maintains the psychic ability stolen from their soul. The Vampire can make use of the stolen power for twice as many days as they have dots in the Coil of Zirnitra.%0a%3c %0a%3c Taste of Power%0a%3c Prerequisite Coil: Ascendancy (The Coil of Zirnitra)%0a%3c Public/Private: Public%0a%3c The Dragon may concoct a solution (potion) from the blood of an individual, thus granting a temporary usage of one of the Vampire’s Disciplines.%0a%3c To do this, the Dragon mixes a drought created in equal parts of the donator’s blood, the Dragons blood and several other enhancing and binding arcane substances, including the sap of a rather rare breed of Mandrake. The creator of the drought must have and understand not only Occult knowledge pertaining to the herbs and substances but must have medical understanding as to properly mix the blood without it spoiling the concoction. Intelligence + Occult is rolled first, representing the proper knowledge of the components involved, followed by Wits + Medicine to combine them without spoiling it (or accidentally creating something toxic). Exceptional success on the latter adds to the duration of the Discipline by one day or one use per exceptional.%0a%3c Outcome: The imbiber may use the donator’s Discipline as if it were one of his own. The potion lasts one day per point of blood potency of the Dragon that creates the potion once imbibed, or until the Discipline has been used a single time (unless an additional use has been added as per above).%0a%3c Drawback: As the substance burns through its unnatural course, it ends with a painful crash. The imbiber takes one point of unavoidable bashing per level of the Discipline being used upon its use.%0a%3c (Note: Activation rolls, Willpower and or Vitae coast are still paid for by the imbiber of the drought.)%0a%3c %0a%3c Trapping the Beast’s Hunger%0a%3c Prerequisite Coil: Beast’s Hunger (Wyrm ••)%0a%3c Public/Private: Private%0a%3c Procedure: The Dragon takes a natural Adder Stone (availability 3), paints an adjuration for the Beast in blood and lets it simmer in an alchemical concoction that includes human bile. Over the next six hours the Dragon must Lash Out with the Monstrous Beast. Then the subject must devour the stone whole, dealing 1 Aggravated damage that can not be reduced.%0a%3c Outcome: The stone sits in the subject’s stomach for one week before they vomit it back up. While there, the stone soaks up Vitae like it once did poison. The subject ignores the first point of Vitae ingested in a scene, the first Vitae from each mortal from a feeding roll, and the first Vitae gotten from any instance of using the Herd merit no matter how many dots are used at once. Further Vitae goes to feed the stone until it is full (5 plus the creator’s dots in the Coil of the Wyrm). A point of willpower allows the subject to spend the blood in the stone as though it was in their pool for one turn, or to transfer any amount of blood from the stone to their pool. The stone may be fed even if the consumer’s heart has been removed, but transferring Vitae to the consumer’s pool requires them to spill the Vitae onto their heart. Mortals may only feed the stone with Vitae from Kindred, and unless the stone is full they suffer an unquenchable hunger and the Deprived Condition.%0a%3c %0a%3c Unity of Faction%0a%3c Public/Private: Private%0a%3c Prerequisite Coil: The Vast Dynasty (Voidvode •••••)%0a%3c Additional Prerequisites: Unity of Purpose, Unity of Spirit%0a%3c Procedure: During a renewal or performance of Unity of Purpose, the Kindred must, at the completion of the ritual, consume the substance, taking the Humbled Condition as the substance racks his mind with his place as a single part of the whole. The smoke then billows forth not from the bowl, but from his eyes, nose, and mouth, the disorienting process draining 3 points of Willpower away from him.%0a%3c Outcome: Those that inhale the smoke are brought even closer together than Unity of Purpose normally allows for. In addition to its typical advantages, those involved in it count as being part of the same Pack/Coterie/Motley/similar grouping for the sake of benefits gained via Merits and Powers. This does not inherently allow anyone to buy merits they normally couldn’t, however, nor to use such Powers themselves, simply to count as a member (for instance, this would allow safe access into a “Motley” Hollow, or allow Pack Rites to affect members of Unity).%0a%3c %0a%3c Unity of Purpose%0a%3c Prerequisite Coil: The Vast Dynasty (Voivode •••••)%0a%3c Public/Private: Private%0a%3c Procedure: The Dragon, while within a Wyrm’s Nest, mixes at least 2 (or more, see below) points of Vitae, a drop of blood from every potential participant, and a cup of expensive wine (at least Availability 3) together in a gold-lined container. The substance must then be stirred for at least an hour without any pause, which requires a successful Resolve + Stamina roll.%0a%3c Outcome: The Dragon is able to use the substance to form a unique bond among a close circle, represented by those with dots in Mystery Cult Initiation (or a similar merit) in the same group as the Dragon. Once completed and left in open air for at least a minute, the substance boils into an unnaturally black, shadowy smoke, which can be inhaled by, at most, a number of cultists equal to the Dragon’s Blood Potency +1 for each additional Vitae used. Both they and the Dragon gain a sort of unity of purpose towards the group’s ideals and members, focusing on it to an unnatural extent, akin to the effects of a Blood Bond. This has the following effects:%0a%3c %0a%3c All characters lose a point of Willpower immediately, to help ‘empower’ the bond, and lose another each month.%0a%3c The characters are protected from new Blood Bonds from outside the group (but not each other), akin to a third stage bond.%0a%3c Beneficial Powers improve duration akin to a third stage bond’s effect when used on another cultist. This has no effect on Awakened magic’s duration, though.%0a%3c Members are considered to have at least a Strong sympathetic bond for the sake of Sympathetic magic (via Mage).%0a%3c Being forced to work against other cultists OR the cult’s ideals causes a form of intense spiritual duress, which helps members shake off supernatural influence. When affected by a power that would force or influence a cultist to cause any sort of harm/problem to other cultists, the cult as a whole, or the group’s goals, or reveal cult information, the character may roll a Clash of Wills (Supernatural Tolerance + Mystery Cult Initiation, +4 for duration) to ignore the effect. However, the character suffers a condition/other drawback as if he’d failed a Breaking Point roll, as appropriate to the character type (but doesn’t lose Integrity/etc).%0a%3c Willingly betraying the cult/cultists causes a Breaking point for ANY Integrity equivalent, as if a Humanity/etc 1 sin/act, or with a &#8722;5 penalty if dependent on an attribute roll (for a Werewolf, it’s towards the closest of Spirit/Flesh to their current Harmony). In addition, the character loses all dots of Mystery Cult Initiation in the group (Sanctity applies), and takes an unavoidable resistant aggravated damage per dot lost.%0a%3c Cultists never have a Hostile impression between each other, no matter what, so long as they still have their MCI.%0a%3c The benefits fade when a Blood Bond normally would (typically a year), but it can be renewed with a re-use of the Scale at any point. The Scale can also be repeated to add new members into the affected populace.%0a%3c %0a%3c Unity of Power%0a%3c Private%0a%3c Prerequisite:’ Ascendancy (Zirnitra •••••)%0a%3c Procedure: The Dragon, who must be under the effects of Unity of Purpose and Unity of Spirit, must work with at least 3 others (who must have a pool of supernatural energy of some kind) under the same effect within a Wyrm’s Nest that’s claimed by 1 or more members of that group. All four individuals donate a point of energy to a metallic object that’s prepared with geomantic carvings. The Dragon’s Vitae should be applied last, the blood physically traced over the designs, and the object is then buried or otherwise stored ‘within’ the nest overnight. %0a%3c Outcome: The shared resonance of the group is then ‘recognized’ by the Nest itself, and a feedback of energy flows forth into all those under the effects of Unity of Purpose that step foot in the Nest’s area within the next Chapter. Any such characters affected may spend a point of Willpower and suffer 1 point of unavoidable/resistant lethal damage (it cannot be prevented with any form of armor, and magical healing does not work on it), as they allow the energy to burn through their patterns. However, the next time they use a supernatural power of any kind, the nest’s energy reinforces it, and they gain a bonus equal to the Nest’s rating. If used within the Nest itself, it also provides the 9-Again benefit. %0a%3c Any given individual may only be under the effect of 1 ‘charge’ of this ability at a time (which may only occur once per use of the Scale), and using the Scale more often than once per Chapter will damage the Nest, suppressing it for the next full month.%0a%3c %0a%3c Unity of Spirit%0a%3c Public/Private: Private%0a%3c Prerequisite Coil: Ascendancy (Zirnitra •••••)%0a%3c Additional Prerequisite: Unity of Purpose%0a%3c Procedure: The Sorcerer, who must be under the effects of Unity of Purpose, must feed on at least 3 different types of supernatural creatures (Mortal characters with supernatural merits count) under the effect of that Scale with him, or more if desired, and keep that Vitae within his system while within a Wyrm’s Nest of at least level 3 for an hour or more. At the end of that period, while still within the Nest, he slits his wrist and empties the retrieved blood (now in the form of his Vitae) into a large enough container. It’s then mixed with an equal amount of a potent acid and several odd occult ingredients, which must be allowed to dissolve within it. Without healing the wounds, he must then dip his arms into the resulting, bubbling mixture, and focus his will on the combined resonance (Which costs 1 point of Willpower). %0a%3c Outcome: The substance both boils into the air and flows into the Kindred’s veins, burning him deeply in the process (he takes 2 unavoidable aggravated damage), but allowing him to absorb a bit of the nature of the blood donated, and spread that to others that share the Bond of Unity of Purpose with him. All those sharing the bond of Unity of Purpose with the Dragon find themselves better able to benefit from the powers used by each other. For the purposes of the effects of supernatural powers used by members only, each member counts as the most beneficial of the ‘donor’ templates when deciding if they’re a valid target or what the final effects are. This won’t let someone do something they normally can’t that’s required to gain the benefit (Like for something that provides a bonus to a Uratha’s shapeshifting), nor will it provide them non-template prerequisites they don’t meet. For the sake of abilities granted that rely on supernatural energy, however, 1 Willpower and 1 of the character’s own energy form (mortals can spend an extra willpower) can replace 1 point of cost of another energy type, but only for something directly granted by a power (such as an Influence by a Rite). This will similarly not grant any other template-based abilities, such as a Vampire’s or Werewolf’s regenerative abilities, and so powers relying on that might be dangerous or impossible to use on those lacking it. %0a%3c This lasts for as long as Unity of Purpose does, including any renewal of it.%0a%3c %0a%3c Ward the Wyre%0a%3c Prerequisite Coil: The Dragon’s BReath (Zirnitra ••••)%0a%3c Additional Prerequisites: Fuel the Fire%0a%3c Public/Private: Private%0a%3c The Dragon has developed a fundamental understanding of how Dragons Nests energies function, and by exerting himself over those energies he has learned to shape them into a protective ward surrounding its area of influence.%0a%3c Process: The Dragon makes an extended Wits + Occult roll minus the rating of the Nest, needing a total of successes equal to the rating of the Nest. %0a%3c Outcome: The Dragon creates a resonance based Ward to surround the Nest and protect it. The Wards generated by this Scale are meant as a protective measure only affecting outside sources that would cause harm or disruption (including information-gathering); such actions, whether mundane or supernatural take a penalty equal to the Nest’s rating (&#8722;1 further on an exceptional success in the Procedure). The Dragon/s that utilize this Scale my designate rather or not a person is allowed to bypass these Wards much in the same way as those designated by the Perilous Nest Merit.%0a%3c Due to the Ward being generated by the Nest itself it cannot produce such effects indefinitely, thus the life span of the Ward is based upon the strength of the Nest. It can be held in place for one week per point of the Nests rating.%0a%3c %0a%3c Wyrms Bastion%0a%3c Public/Private: Private%0a%3c Prerequisite Coil: Ascendancy %0a%3c Procedure: The Dragon creates an Alchemic concoction of Herbs that connects him ever more to the Wyrms Nest and allows him to call on its supernal energies to generate and wrap himself in a form of supernal armor dependant on the Strength of the Nest. Outcome: The Nest wraps the Dragon in an unseen shroud of metaphysical armor offing him a degree of protection. So long as the Dragon remains connected to the Nest the armor is ever present but it must be activated by spending a point of Supernatural Fuel for the scene. This armor is equal to half the level of the Nest rounded up that he is connected to. The supernal armor granted may stack with that of mundane armor and/or natural armors. Drawback: The Scale requires that a DOT of Willpower be used to connect Nest and Dragon.%0a%3c %0a%3c Fiends Blessing%0a%3c Prerequisite Coil: Ascendancy%0a%3c Public/Private: Private%0a%3c Procedure: With a little bit of effort the Dragon taps into the Nest and then alters the flow of energies from it into his own hands as a means to manipulate the physical form of another creature altering their flesh as if it were clay resting on an artist’s wheel.%0a%3c The Dragon first makes a Roll to Resist Frenzy since he is tapping so deeply into the Energies that flow through the Nest, as they might drive him mad, he then may redirect those energies into his own hands imbuing them with the capability to manipulate flesh as he wills it.%0a%3c Once this is accomplished the Dragon may roll Intelligence + Medicine to create the changes he wishes. The use of Intelligence + Medicine replaces the normal crafting roll for equipment.%0a%3c Outcome: The subject’s body is forever changed. The Dragon may elect to manipulate the physical form of the patient reshaping bone, moving fat and flesh to create calluses over vital organs and so forth creating organic equipment. It should be noted that this Scale is only capable of creating equipment that could be sensibly crafted/created/altered from flesh and bone or organic material taken from the patient him/herself.%0a%3c Like normal equipment, each +1 bonus may be traded for an equipment tag or special feature and an Exceptional Success adds an additional +1 or an extra tag. Unlike normal equipment, it may not normally be stolen, removed or disarmed as it is a part of the person. By default, these changes are obvious and monstrous, but that can be mitigated by adding Retractable tags. As well, no more than the Nest’s rating in bonuses/tags/rating may be given to the equipment in total. %0a%3c The Retractable tag renders the augmentation completely undetectable to anything short of supernatural analyses and relevant medical tests analyzing someone’s insides, such as an x-ray detecting altered bones. However, the augment provides no benefit without first being deployed as an Instant action. Deployment lasts until retracted as an Instant Action, but while deployed it is obvious to casual observation.%0a%3c Although normally permanent, intensive surgery or supernatural healing can remove the effects of this scale as though it were a number of Aggravated Health Levels equal to the Rating of the Nest the Scale was performed at. %0a%3c Drawback: Using or being subjected to this scale calls into question the person’s relationship to their body and identity as it related to physical form. This calls for a Humanity 4 Breaking Point for both the Dragon and their subject. Non-Kindred subjects suffer an Integrity or Clarity breaking point with a &#8722;3 penalty.%0a%3c The Dragon must spend a point of Vitae/Essence/ or what supernal energy source he has the ability to tap into. per point of average availability the non-organic equipment would cost.%0a%3c The Dragon takes a point of LETHAL DMG per point of Equipment meant to be created as the strain of manipulating such energies has a toll on the Dragon as well. Someone may only benefit from one use of this scale per point of Stamina at a time, not counting the removal of Conditions or Tilts.%0a%3c Whenever someone undergoes the use of this Scale an Equipment Request should be sent in to note the equipment on the PCs sheet.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Werewolf and Wolf-Blooded%0a%3c Fetishes/Talens%0a%3c Outsider Fetish (+• Level)%0a%3c Effect:Not a Fetish of its own so much as an additional alteration made to an existing Fetish, the Uratha makes it so a Fetish can be activated by those lacking the spiritual attunement that they themselves are inherently gifted with. By raising another Fetish or Talen’s rating by 1, the spirit within is left in a ‘half awake’ state, and can be activated with a special trigger related to its ban, thus allowing non-Uratha (most often, Wolf-Blooded) to make use of it with the normal activation pool. %0a%3c This power is not needed to activate a Fetish by channeling essence into it, for those capable of doing so another way.%0a%3c %0a%3c Golden Pill (• Talen)%0a%3c A medicinal ball, typically about the size of a quarter, which heals all bashing or one Lethal, whichever is more severe. More than two pills in a day inflicts the Exhausted Condition.%0a%3c %0a%3c Rites%0a%3c Brotherhood (••, Pack Rite)%0a%3c Symbols: The pack, brotherhood, blood, binding%0a%3c Public/Private: Private%0a%3c Sample Rite: The pack gathers together to enjoy a meal and drink prepared with the express intention of creating a familial bond between them. The ritemaster begins the meal with an anectdote about one or another of the pack, a witty recollection meant to brighten the mood and share the memory with the whole. Each in turn recalls a story of their own, building up the good mood and bringing them together as strong siblings with unbreakable bonds. (Wits+Socialize)%0a%3c Action: Extended (10 successes; each roll represents half an hour)%0a%3c Duration: 1 Season, with the option to renew before the duration has elapsed.%0a%3c Success: The pack may initiate remote communication with one another, on an individual basis, with Resolve + Composure. This communication is limited, granting a general feeling of the packmate’s state of being and direction in which they can be found. Exceptional successes on the initiation provide greater input, a clearer idea of thoughts, as well as an approximate distance to their current location. In moments of extreme emotion, or when in the midst of real combat, this roll can be made reflexively to alert the whole pack, though the individuals would need to succeed on their own roll to have a clear indication of what triggered such an event.%0a%3c %0a%3c Elixir of Life (•••, Pack Rite)%0a%3c Symbols: The moon, herbs, blood, healing%0a%3c Public/Private: Private%0a%3c Sample Rite: In the light of the moon, the ritualist and participants wound themselves, collecting some blood into a mixture of herbs and ground together. The resulting mixture is daubed onto the chest of each participant with symbols of the moon, health and longevity, while speaking of the virtues of the blood and herbs to reinforce their effectiveness. (Intelligence+Medicine)%0a%3c Action: Extended (10 successes; each roll represents ten minutes)%0a%3c Duration: 1 month%0a%3c Success: Pack members’ blood is strengthened, blessing them with exceptional health and healing, which decreases their healing rate by half. Uratha and others with the means to use Essence, Vitae or other Energy (or even goblin fruit) for regeneration find their healing likewise improved, doubling the effectiveness of using such for healing themselves (one Essence heals two Lethal in a turn, one Blood heals two health, a fruit doubles the healing effect), though this only works outside of combat. To ensure this, the ritemaster must sacrifice enough blood to take one Lethal to empower the rite.%0a%3c %0a%3c Rite of Healing (•••, Wolf Rite)%0a%3c Symbols: Water, The Moon, Breath, and Fire%0a%3c Public/Private: Public%0a%3c Sample Rite: Niamh uses water and the mercurial nature of the moon,the warmth of the hearth and the calmness of breath to steady herself and begin to focus on the rite of healing working her knowledge with the beneficial natures of the spirits and the forsaken’s love of luna to help knit together the flesh of those that are wounded. (Int+Occult)%0a%3c Cost: 2 Essence per Health Level to be healed.%0a%3c Action: Extended (2 successes per wound, maximum of 5 for 10 successes; each roll represents 5 minutes. The target must be chosen before rolling) %0a%3c Success: The rite is capable of expediating a Werewolf’s regeneration at the expense of the user’s own life energy. 1 aggravated damage on the target Uratha, who must be present for the entire rite, is healed per 2 target successes, although 1 lethal damage is done to the ritualist in return (but this is regenerated normally). Each use of this rite can heal a maximum of 5 health levels of aggravated damage on a single target, who must be a Werewolf or a creature with similar regenerative abilities.%0a%3c %0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c All Factions%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Directory: Game Reference%0a%3c Book Policy	House Rules	Character Creation	Sanctioning	Experience Guide	Code of Conduct	Site Policies And Practices%0a%3c Edit - History - Print - Recent Changes - Search%0a%3c Page last modified on January 02, 2018, at 03:59 PM%0a%3c The Storytelling System, Beast the Primordial, Changeling the Lost, Chronicles of Darkness, Demon the Descent, Mage the Awakening, Vampire the Requiem, and Werewolf the Forsaken ©2014-2016 CCP hf and published by Onyx Path Publishing.%0a
