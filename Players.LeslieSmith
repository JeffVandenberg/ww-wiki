Coupled with her scottish accent and her penchant for demanding people drink with her, it's easy to find her raging when someone says no, or with flushed cheeks and laughing loud enough for half the city to hear her.  She usually has a bit of soot over a cheek or nose and because of her work smells strongly of hops, yeast, and sometimes sulfur and cherry smoke.  She rarely paints her face, but when she does she favors colors that bring out her natural hair color and eyes, browns, golds, and faint reds.  Her fashion fits what or where she is going, but when she is able to relax she dresses like something out of a "renfaire" or despite her gruff mentality and attitude, a dress.  Despite her small stature she is always standing tall, obviously refusing to let her height determine how people judge her. %0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Mein''%0a%0a%25center%25Even her mask is short but her true self is much shorter.  She is 4'6" and hates looking up at people, almost always finding a bar stool to climb onto to be more at level with those around her.  Her fit body becomes a bit more muscular and calloused, with veins that pop out of her forearms slightly and thick stronger fingers on slightly larger than normal hands for her size.  Her flesh has a slight bronze tint to it, as if she were made out of metal and then given a fleshy paint job.  Her hair is even more vibrant in her mein, and is as if the very color of a jumping fire had been captured and dyed over her head.  While she isn't on fire, the thought of having a flaming head of hair makes the dwarf laugh heartily.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Mantle''%0a%0a%25center%25There is a constant oppressive heat around the woman, as if you are standing in the heart of a forge.  When she gets angry or is forced to heft her hammer, or teach someone not to insult her, the furnace becomes a raging inferno.  Visible heat mirages come in waves from her and the smell of sulfur and strangely grass that has been baking in a mid-Summer sun.%0a%0a%25cframe width=0px bgcolor=grey width=500px%25 https://i.imgur.com/mF4ylwX.jpg%0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''Gallery'''%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #707070'  margin-left=10px width=215px%25 https://i.imgur.com/Xx8bRWA.jpg%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #707070'  margin-left=10px width=215px%25 https://i.imgur.com/MEBunDu.png%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #707070'  margin-left=10px width=215px%25 https://i.imgur.com/PEjzfgz.jpg%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #707070'  margin-left=10px width=215px%25 https://i.imgur.com/2Ohu6Kb.jpg%0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''Contacts'''%0a%0a||! %25changeling%25Image ||! %25changeling%25Name ||! %25changeling%25Relationship ||! %25changeling%25Comment ||! %25changeling%25Ringtone ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''Hooks'''%0a%0a!!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''Beer!

Her beer is full of unique and strong tastes that hint at the complicated palate she has.  She is always willing to brew for events and for those that just want to stop by and taste her best, she has a brewery with a small eatery inside.

Whether you want a prissy pretty locket made for your girlfriend or a full suit of authentic plate mail, Leslie has the ability, and the Forge to accommodate!

With Chainmail and massive warhammer, Leslie wades through hobs and enemies of the freehold like a ball of red haired fury.  She is always up for a good fight, even while drunk, especially while drunk, and will happily bash faces in while singing random drinking songs (especially if drunk already).  She is also always willing to spar her fellow Summer Court members, reveling in getting smashed in the face while smashing others in the face.  The bigger and badder the threat, the bigger the grin, and the more she prepares (By getting drunk).  %0a%0a!!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''Here we come a wassailing  (Spring Court, Changelings, Alchoholics)'': %0aAre you throwing a party?  Are you wondering where you are going to get the beer for a party?  Are you tired of flat American piss water and in the mood for something that has flavor?  Do you want goblin fruit ale?  Leslie is oddly a friend of the Spring court and always ready to brew for a party.  She almost never charges a fee to the Spring court when they need ale for a ball and if someone wanted to throw a get together that wasn't even sanctioned by the Spring Court, in the name of desire and joy the dwarf will happily bring kegs of enriched beer crafted with tender loving care.  But don't pout, mortals, for a small price you too can get the lady brewer to brew for your party!
