Known History%0aTwin brother of Russell Lawrence, Kurt is forever the irresponsible little brother who has not lived up to his older brother’s accomplishments.%0a%0aA Portland native, Kurt has never strayed far from the city for long, at least not by his own choice. His temper manifested early and his time growing up was punctuated by fighting, brawling, under-age drinking, recreational drug use that probably went a bit past recreational, and a long juvenile criminal record. Academics were a wash, school athletics hardly worth mentioning as Kurt was inevitably ejected for some offense and coaches rarely tolerated his disruptive behavior.%0a%0aThis came to a head in the beginning of his college years when his brother was getting ready for law school and had already bailed to LA. Kurt was out drinking in frustration after realizing he was about to fully flunk out of community college. The bar was a dive and Kurt was underage still by a few months. He was six sheets to the wind when a fight started over a girl. That was when Kurt truly entered a rage the likes of which he had never experienced. His strength increased, he grabbed the overweight biker and pounded his face into a bloody mess. When the cops arrived, kurt was still seeing red and was bouncing the guy’s skull off the concrete floor. Kurt was sentenced to 10 years. He has only recently returned to life as a free man.%0a%0aIncarceration was not kind on Kurt. He never joined a gang which made all the gangs his enemy. He was shanked several times, but recovered surprisingly well and eventually gave as good as he got. His skills developed from harsh life and he diverged further and further from his brother.%0a%0aFinally released from prison, he is trying to rejoin the real world as a master of his own rage and find where he should belong. Although his brother is still a pain in his ass, family is family. %0a%0a%0a----%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/2LnP30Y.png%0a%0a(:table:)%0a(:cellnr width=50%25 align=left style='padding-left: 10px;':)%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=4px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=7px width=75%25https://i.imgur.com/NLj6Ryb.jpg%0a[[Russell Lawrence|%25color=#FFE5B4%25''Russell'']]\\%0a%25color=#FFFFFF%25Sigh.
