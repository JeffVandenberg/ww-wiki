All the same sort of fool looking at the same problem from their own sides, and they'd rather be right than fix anything. A staunch Libertarian, he's the sort that thinks gay married couples should be able to defend their marijuana crops with automatic weapons. To most he's a devil's advocate, who'd argue with anyone over anything, and doesn't mind looking stupid to make his point. If you can put up with him, you must be worth putting up with. %0a%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25mage%25'''Nimbus'''%0a%0a!!!!!%25center%25%25mage%25''Long term'': %0a%25center%25The dim keening of silence, A looming pressure on the color of the world around you.%0a %0a%0a!!!!!%25center%25%25mage%25''Immediate'': %0a%0a%25center%25 Deafening silence.

(Anyone)'': %0aChange can make a lot of things happen. For someone no one knows, he sure seems to have a good idea of what's happening. What he can't find he'll make for you, and what he can't make for you probably isn't real. He appreciates punctual payment for services rendered. %0a%0a!!!!%25mage%25 ''Killer Robot (Anyone)'': %0aChange seems to always have his nose in some project, homework, trouble, or someone else's business. He rarely turns to face the people he's speaking to, and always seems irritated by something. The type of arrogant that's smarter than most everyone around him and he knows it. Rude.%0a%0a!!!!%25mage%25 ''The Best Liars, Don't Need To. (Anyone)'': %0aChange asks few questions he doesn't already know the answers to, asks for things he already has, and has a tendency of finding problems with vehicles that weren't there when they get brought into his shop. For some reason, law enforcement, insurance agents, and Feds don't even bother looking into his crummy pit-stop. Always a hobo or three looming around, sure, but he's got the cheapest gas prices in town. %0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a(:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a%0a(:cellnr width=100%25:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25mage%25'''Quotes'''%0a%0a"Without Death, feared as the end, there can be no change, making even the terrible Supernal Forces powerless in it's absence." -Dylan%0a%0a%25mortal%25 "I am a quote!

All the same sort of fool looking at the same problem from their own sides, and they'd rather be right than fix anything. A staunch Libertarian, he's the sort that thinks gay married couples should be able to defend their marijuana crops with automatic weapons. To most he's a devil's advocate, who'd argue with anyone over anything, and doesn't mind looking stupid to make his point. If you can put up with him, you must be worth putting up with. %0a---%0a> %25center%25[Enter Here]%0a
