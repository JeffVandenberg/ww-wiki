Remember, however, that XP requests are themselves limited to 2 per month.%25%25%0a%0a*If Player A submits a request to raise his Strength to 3, that request must be approved before he can create and submit the request to raise his Strength to 4.%0a*If Player B submits a request to purchase a Discipline, she must submit a request to purchase the first dot. She cannot create and submit a request to raise that same Discipline to 2 until the original request has been approved.%0a%0aNote that this doesn't prevent purchase of Scaled merits at higher than their minimum value if it makes sense for the merit in question (it's easy enough to hire a 4 dot Retainer instead of training one from the ground up, for instance) but improving them beyond that still follows the '1 dot per request' rule. This will generally never apply to Styles and other merits that give a separate effect per dot, just those with a single scaling effect.
