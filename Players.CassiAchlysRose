Description%0a%0aShe looks like a girl who might have stepped out of a mid-90’s Type O Negative video, curvy, but clearly in good shape. Long, arrow-straight black hair frames an attractive, if slightly severe, face, high cheekbones and striking, intense eyes. She’s remarkably pale, with a faint hint of blush to her cheeks, and favors extremely dark red or black lipstick, smoky black eyeshadow. She wears a variety of jewelry, all of it silver or stainless steel - several ear piercings, necklaces with various symbols on them, rings of a motley variety of shapes and sizes. Her clothing is nearly always a dress or a skirt of some sort, ankle length being the preferred length, black leather boots, corset tops. She has a tattoo of a stylized ankh on her forearm. Her style is definitely from a bygone era. In contrast to her odd appearance, her alto voice and demeanor are cheerful, warm, and inviting, and there’s just something friendly about her. She doesn’t even have a hint of a recognizable accent most of the time, but occasionally when she gets excited vastly different accents can creep into her voice.%0a%0a----%0a%0a!!
