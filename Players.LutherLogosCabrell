text=%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/D6Q3Fzv.jpg%0a!! "What is known"%0a*Luther Cabrell is an Englishman and as he'll tell you himself, a long time practitioner of Hedge magic. His mentor and He have had a parting of the ways and it was agreed that Luther should seek out another place to hang his hat. Tarot, pendulum, and eventually, a thrown dart at a map of the United States led him here.%0a*Apparently, magic and strangeness tend to run in the Cabrell family. Going all the way back to Morgana Le Fay and former knight of the round table, Uriens.%0a* Luther Cabrell is a practicing psychologist and is published in the English Journal of Psychiatric Medicine.%0a* It is said, he is attempting to build a new practice here in Portland.%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/D6Q3Fzv.jpg%0a%0a!! "What is not known"%0a* Luther is fairly cagey about his path.  He avers that he is NOT a Seer. but that traditionally his path has been treated with distrust and discrimination.  Maybe it's different for Mastigos in America...%0a* Luther is fairly open about being a member of the Mysterium. But beyond that he is remarkably tight-lipped about his order. It's important to KNOW secrets. But it's almost AS important to KEEP secrets.%0a* Luther rarely talks about home. Apparently his awakening massively complicated his life and made his life's work essentially useless. It also meant that many of his peers treated him as if he's had training wheels on the whole of his time as a hedge mage.%0a* Luther is a bit uptight and a bit repressed. He doesn't judges others, but maybe envy's them a little.
