She commands without yelling, her tone becomes firm and clear. But that's a rare thing. Often Saoirse speaks calm and gently, a warm soul who wants to ensure people live healthy lives free of violence - even if that means putting herself in the way of harm.%0a%0aIt's well known to anyone that talks to her for any length of time that Saoirse feels deeply about her beliefs, without coming to any judgments about ways outside of her own. While she promotes nonviolence she recognizes that the world they live in is not one that readily accepts it. She doesn't begrudge others their use of violence, but seeks to ensure it's always the last resort whenever possible.

Her warm brown eyes watch the world around her with an ease of someone who's got a reason to love life. Sometimes she's seen with bruises or cuts, and those who get a glimpse beyond the clothing that usually covers her pretty well notice that she has a lot of scars.%0a%3c %0a%3c || %25mortal%25Height:||5'1"|| %25mortal%25Weight:||100lbs|| %25mortal%25Complexion:|| Tanned || %25mortal%25Hair Color:|| Dark Brown ||%0a%3c || %25mortal%25Eye Color:|| Brown || %25mortal%25Date of Birth:||8/21/1995|| %25mortal%25Place of Birth:|| Portland || %25mortal%25Accent:|| None ||%0a%3c || %25mortal%25Build Type:||Skinny || %25mortal%25Scars:||Numerous|| %25mortal%25Tattoos:|| None || %25mortal%25Piercings:|| Ears ||%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25%0a%3c Saoirse has a soft voice that she doesn't often raise, but when she does her military training comes to the fore. She commands without yelling, her tone becomes firm and clear. But that's a rare thing.
