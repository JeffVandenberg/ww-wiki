At first glance%0a%0aAgatha is a standing 5.25 feet Japanese-American woman. The most striking detail about her appearance is that she suffers from albinism, her skin is pale, she carries her silky hair at shoulder length, and her eyes are blood red even though they are hidden most of the time behind thick glasses thanks to her very poor eyesight. Agatha is more on the chubby side, having put on some weight during her teenage years. She usually wears thick clothes that conceal most of her curves, be it sweaters, baggy pants, duffel coats and such, when she goes outside she often wears hoods. When it comes to her body language Agatha looks either tired, stressed or both. She is rarely smiling about anything and lowers her head whenever she talks to anyone, usually never daring to look them in the eyes. She always seems uneasy when around people and seems incredibly nervous when she’s forced to interact with them.%0a%0a%0a%0a!!
