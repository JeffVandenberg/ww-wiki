Her green eyes almost always seem to be searching for something, as if she were reading the world itself like a book.  In conversation, she goes from extremely focused to far off.

She fixed up an old computer she found in a dumpster because her parents couldn't afford one, and her education in computers went from there.  With few options after high school, she joined the Army to help pay for college so she could go into robotics in hopes of pioneering in cybernetics.  Her career there suffered an abrupt end, but she still had her military college benefits, and managed to get into University of Miami, graduating shortly after with top marks.
