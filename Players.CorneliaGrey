A trailer trash family, an alcoholic mom and a deadbeat dad with no job. It was a life with no prospects, no hope for a future. She escaped into her imagination, sketching, drawing, expressing herself with pen against paper and brush to a canvas. It was too easy for the Fair Folks' agents to lure her into the Hedge, a friendly smile, a few encouraging words, a promise of better things to come. A few 'ooh!'s and 'aah!'s over her art, and she swallowed the bait — hook, line, and sinker. %0a%0aHer Keeper, '''the Instrument of Desire''', was as fickle and incomprehensible as the rest of the Others, its domain one of excess and opulence; night and day are endless feasts, performances, orgies, and all manner of hedonism. If it sounds too good to be true, it is because it is. It's like that party you wished would never end, except it doesn't. It's the one night stand that ends at the break of dawn, but dawn never comes. The heat of an ever-present crowd sticks to you. The constant chatter of voices. Hands reaching for you — for a handshake, for a dance, to introduce a friend. The atmosphere is claustrophobic, emotionally and mentally exhausting. A day of partying is fun. A weekend too. But a month, every single day, stretching into a year, a decade? Picture a banquet in the style of the Hunger Games; every participant desperately struggling to remain alive and sane, every day a day of overindulgance tinged with the otherworldly horrors of the Gentry.%0a%0aAnd Cornelia does not speak of it. Why should she? Every time she tried to explain it to one of the other Lost, she was met with scoffs and sneers. A palace of unearthly delights and nights on end with one feast after another? Surely, her Durance was not so terrible as theirs. But they do not know. Perhaps it is better that way.

Although her favourite tool is the paintbrush, she has become engaged in all sorts of local arts and crafts groups, even performing at one of the local theatre productions on occasion. There is oft a dystopian element to her art, and she freely interprets themes of loss, grief, and tarnished innocence. Other artists beware: anyone with creative talent runs the risk of drawing her attention.%0a%0a%25changeling%25 '''''Frozen-hearted, soul-departed (anyone):'''''\\%0a%25%25 The Onyx Court knows that although sorrow can be crippling, it is also a fount of inspiration. It tells us that we have dared to love, it informs us that what we lost was truly precious, that we truly are human. Whether a maelstrom that threatens to drown everyone in its path, or simply a persistent, deep ache, the courtiers of Winter drinks deep from its chalice to replenish their Glamour. And Cornelia is no exception, reaching out to those in pain to help assuage their pain, to offer a shoulder to cry on, or an ear to listen to all the woes of the world. %0a%0a%25changeling%25 '''''To fetch a fetching fetch (changeling):'''''\\%0a%25%25 There is a fetch on the loose, a vile, soulless substitute from the Hedge, and now it lives her life. It goes to art school. It has a job. And a relationship. All the things that should have been here. What a wretched thing! The thing is, Cornelia has no idea how to deal with this strange clone of herself, if it even needs dealing with. Perhaps someone in the Freehold knows about the best ways to handle a fetchling?

It is a distant sadness that contrasts her fey allure without diminishing it, a subtle reminder of Winter's stark beauty. If the Gods themselves had sculpted this woman, she would have been one of their masterpieces. But the Fairest has not been fashioned by the Gods' — no, she is the work of the Gentry, part human and part fae, Thorn-scarred, strong-willed, a proud and noble heart guarded by impenetrable sheets of thick ice and steel.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!! %25changeling%25 History:%0a%3c Once upon a time, she lived a different life. A trailer trash family related to the Hayes, an alcoholic mom and a deadbeat dad with no job. It was a life with no prospects, no hope for a future. She escaped into her imagination, sketching, drawing, expressing herself with pen against paper and brush to a canvas. It was too easy for the Fair Folks' agents to lure her into the Hedge, a friendly smile, a few encouraging words, a promise of better things to come. A few 'ooh!'s and 'aah!'s over her art, and she swallowed the bait — hook, line, and sinker. %0a%3c %0a%3c Her Keeper, '''the Instrument of Desire''', was as fickle and incomprehensible as the rest of the Others, its domain one of excess and opulence; night and day are endless feasts, performances, orgies, and all manner of hedonism. If it sounds too good to be true, it is because it is. It's like that party you wished would never end, except it doesn't. It's the one night stand that ends at the break of dawn, but dawn never comes. The heat of an ever-present crowd sticks to you. The constant chatter of voices. Hands reaching for you — for a handshake, for a dance, to introduce a friend. The atmosphere is claustrophobic, emotionally and mentally exhausting. A day of partying is fun. A weekend too. But a month, every single day, stretching into a year, a decade? Picture a banquet in the style of the Hunger Games; every participant desperately struggling to remain alive and sane, every day a day of overindulgance tinged with the otherworldly horrors of the Gentry.%0a%3c %0a%3c And Cornelia does not speak of it. Why should she? Every time she tried to explain it to one of the other Lost, she was met with scoffs and sneers. A palace of unearthly delights and nights on end with one feast after another? Surely, her Durance was not so terrible as theirs. But they do not know. Perhaps it is better that way.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!! %25changeling%25 Role Playing Hooks:%0a%3c %0a%3c %25changeling%25 '''''The artistic prodigy (anyone):'''''\\%0a%3c %25%25 Cornelia has a vivid imagination and a genuine passion for art and culture. Although her favourite tool is the paintbrush, she has become engaged in all sorts of local arts and crafts groups, even performing at one of the local theatre productions on occasion. There is oft a dystopian element to her art, and she freely interprets themes of loss, grief, and tarnished innocence. Other artists beware: anyone with creative talent runs the risk of drawing her attention.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25changeling%25 '''''To fetch a fetching fetch (werewolf):'''''\\%0a%3c %25%25 There is a fetch on the loose - a fetch, a fetch, a wolfling fetch! - and it dons her childhood name of Hayes. So who better to turn to the family she once had, the relatives with roots in the supernatural, to sort this all out? She has yet to reach out in an official capacity to the wolf-blooded family, fearing how they might react to the news of one of theirs being replaced with a warped, soulless subtitute from the land of the Fae. Perhaps it would be better to establish some sort of relation with them first? Yes. Certainly. Yes.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25changeling%25 '''''Frozen-hearted, soul-departed (anyone):'''''\\%0a%3c %25%25 The Onyx Court knows that although sorrow can be crippling, it is also a fount of inspiration. It tells us that we have dared to love, it informs us that what we lost was truly precious, that we truly are human. Whether a maelstrom that threatens to drown everyone in its path, or simply a persistent, deep ache, the courtiers of Winter drinks deep from its chalice to replenish their Glamour. And Cornelia is no exception, reaching out to those in pain to help assuage their pain, to offer a shoulder to cry on, or an ear to listen to all the woes of the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!! %25changeling%25 Contacts:%0a%3c None as of yet.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!! %25changeling%25 Quotes:%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ''"The realm of fairy-story is wide and deep and high and filled with many things: all manner of beasts and birds are found there; shoreless seas and stars uncounted; beauty that is an enchantment, and an ever-present peril; both joy and sorrow as sharp as swords."'' %25changeling%25 - J.R.R Tolkien%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c  %0a%3c %0a%3c [[%3c%3c]] [[%3c%3c]] %0a%3c (:keywords mortal, PC:)%0a%3c (:include GameRef.Directoryplayerchangeling:)%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
