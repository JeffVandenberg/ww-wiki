It's obvious he's build for violence and the application there-of.  When not in tactical gear, he has no apparent fashion sense.   He favors Hawaiian shirts, mostly.   The only real sign of his augments is in how he moves.  Gracefully, smoothly with each step and motion moving into the next.  %0a%0a|| %25color=#606060%25Height:||6'1"|| %25color=#197AC4%25Weight:||205lbs|| %25color=#606060%25Complexion:||Medium|| %25color=#197AC4%25Hair Color:||Dark Brown||%0a|| %25color=#606060%25Eye Color:||Blue|| %25color=#197AC4%25Date of Birth:||6/23/1987|| %25color=#606060%25Place of Birth:||England|| %25color=#197AC4%25Accent:||Cockney||%0a|| %25color=#606060%25Build Type:||Lean|| %25color=#197AC4%25Scars:|| Surgical, stab wounds, etc || %25color=#606060%25Tattoos:||None || %25color=#197AC4%25Piercings:||None ||%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/2UIwCu6.png%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #5A5A5A' margin-top=0px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=25px width=150px height=150px%25https://i.imgur.com/YnSs8RE.jpg%0aHis every step is calculated to look easy and nonchalant.
