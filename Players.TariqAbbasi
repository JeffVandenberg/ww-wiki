He has a solid build, athletic like a runner with a torso that starts broad and trims down toward the waist. Thick black hair crowns his head and a short dark beard traces the sharp line of his jaw.

He often wears traditional Turkish and Pakistani clothing, which can make him stand out in specific, non-diverse crowds in urban spaces. %0a%0a!!!%25changeling%25''Mien''%0a%0aThe Wyrd maintains Tariq's humanoid shape, including his height and athletic build, though his arms may seem a little too long in proportion to his torso. His hair becomes much denser on his head and beard and much more pronounced on his forearms, knuckles, chest, stomach, and legs. Altogether, his hair takes on a shiny quality like black ink. His eyebrows have a few tactile vibrissae (whiskers) that extend out of them in long arcs. Human ears are replaced by long feline ears covered in the same black fur as his beard. They appear to sit slightly higher on the sides of his head by virtue of being much larger and more triangular in shape. Those ears are incredibly mobile, twitching and turning in response to noise and other stimuli. A black feline tail extends out of his lower back, just above the top of his pants. Similarly, his eyes take on a feline appearance; no sclera, only an iris that transitions from yellow to green and a pupil that can dilate inhumanly wide or shrink to vertical slits. On the tips of his fingers sit wicked sharp, curved claws that occasionally extend when Tariq stretches his fingers.
