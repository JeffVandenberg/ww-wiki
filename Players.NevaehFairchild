With long dark hair worn down and styled or up and messy, her most stand out feature are her bright green eyes. Full plush lips are often colored in bright vibrant colors. She favors leather pants paired with band tee-shirts, generally of the heavy metal persuasion and in a quality that some might argue are 'well loved' or 'time to buy something new, Nev'.%0a%0a|| %25color=#FF4B0F%25Height:||5'2"|| %25color=#FFEF0D%25Weight:||100lbs|| %25color=#FF4B0F%25Complexion:||Tanned|| %25color=#FFEF0D%25Hair Color:||Black||%0a|| %25color=#FF4B0F%25Eye Color:||Emerald Green|| %25color=#FFEF0D%25Date of Birth:||10/31/1994|| %25color=#FF4B0F%25Place of Birth:||Miami|| %25color=#FFEF0D%25Accent:||Southern||%0a|| %25color=#FF4B0F%25Build Type:||Curvy|| %25color=#FFEF0D%25Scars:||None || %25color=#FF4B0F%25Tattoos:||Many || %25color=#FFEF0D%25Piercings:||Ears, eyebrow, nose, others||%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #8B008B' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=200px height=200px%25https://i.imgur.com/fxEqyW8.jpg%0aAs a male, Neiko stands only a few inches taller than Nevaeh, which still left him short for most male heights. Like his female counterpart his most stand out feature are his eyes, a hazel green that seem to pop in the right light. His short dark hair is often found tousled and left that way, his reddish beard trimmed and kept neat. He dresses far more simply than Nev, preferring clothing that just seems to blend into whatever the rest of the world would expect a random Joe to look like.%0a%0a|| %25color=#FF4B0F%25Height:||5'7"|| %25color=#FFEF0D%25Weight:||125lbs|| %25color=#FF4B0F%25Complexion:||Tanned|| %25color=#FFEF0D%25Hair Color:||Black||%0a|| %25color=#FF4B0F%25Eye Color:||Emerald Green|| %25color=#FFEF0D%25Date of Birth:||10/31/1994|| %25color=#FF4B0F%25Place of Birth:||Miami|| %25color=#FFEF0D%25Accent:||Southern||%0a|| %25color=#FF4B0F%25Build Type:||Lean|| %25color=#FFEF0D%25Scars:||None || %25color=#FF4B0F%25Tattoos:||None || %25color=#FFEF0D%25Piercings:||None||%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/XQoNQr4.png%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #8B008B' margin-top=0px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=25px width=150px height=150px%25https://i.imgur.com/eGOeAYq.jpg%0aNevaeh's skin darkens with the hint of what would eventually become fur, but instead is just coarse hair, thin as it is over most of her body. Her nails length and become more thick and sharp, extending out from her fingers like would be claws. Her teeth become sharper and more pronounced.%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/4gHqhzv.png%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #8B008B' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=150px height=150px%25https://i.imgur.com/Q4lDINd.jpg%0aNevaeh's murder buzzsaw form is tall, thinly covered with fur that is mostly white but has some grey and green lines through it, as if trying to make itself stand out just that much more. Her fingers are tipped with claws that are sharp and long, ready to murder anything that gets in her way. While rare to see Nevaeh in this form, when she goes buzzsaw, it's something truly impressive.%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/MjLs6VQ.png%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #8B008B' margin-top=0px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=25px width=150px height=150px%25https://i.imgur.com/gTSVABp.jpg%0aIn the murderwolf form, Nevaeh's white fur becomes thicker and has some patches of grey, especially around her eyes, as if the dire wolf form knew it needed to be more special than the regular wolf form, and so it put on a little bit of makeup. %0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/v19OlxW.png%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #8B008B' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=150px height=150px%25https://i.imgur.com/jx4a1nw.jpg%0aNevaeh's wolf form is pure white with light green eyes that all but match the eyes she had once before her change.

She's quick thinking, charming and pretty to look at, often making her lift easier than others. She has a bit of a temper when her buttons are pushed, but is kind and warm otherwise. She has a good shoulder to cry on when needed and a willingness to look out for and take care of her friends. She smiles easily and tends to find things she thinks will be fun not just for herself but also for her friends - which of late seems to involve getting all of them into some form of trouble.%0a(:div2end:)%0a-----%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/ObVj3L4.png%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/bqA9bsM.png%0aThe prey is alone.

(All)''': Nevaeh is a famous rockstar, the lead singer of ''[[Nevermore]]'' a (as she says, angry) rock band. They've released three albums and she has been on tour for most of her time away from Miami. She also grew up in Miami, making her a local returned home from the road.%0a*'''%25color=#14A9FF%25Empath (Those in Need)''': Nevaeh almost can sense emotions and seems to be good at being there when someone needs a shoulder to cry on. She's also good at distracting people from their problems if they don't wanna talk about them.%0a*'''%25color=#1BD603%25Pansexual Pride (LGBTQ+)''': Nevaeh is a proud member and supporter of the LGBTQ+ community, having been been out as pansexual and polyamorous for years before her career even took off. She supports many charity organizations that aid with members of the community as well as outreach and shelter organizations.%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/yYEKUbD.png%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #8B008B' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=325px height=325px%25https://i.imgur.com/j99IMnx.jpg%0a*'''%25color=#14A9FF%25Fairchild Family (Wolves)''': Nevaeh is the only child of one of the members of the Fairchild family. Her mother is a Storm Lord Irraka and her father is a wolfblood. Though she's made her own way without using the family fortune or following what they feel is best, Nevaeh has a good relationship with her family.%0a*'''%25color=#1BD603%25Mediator (All)''': Neveah has always had the ability to listen to people and make them feel heard. She's also well known for her negotiation skills when it comes to her own career.

Like his female counterpart his most stand out feature are his eyes, a hazel green that seem to pop in the right light. His short dark hair is often found tousled and left that way, his reddish beard trimmed and kept neat. He dresses far more simply than Nev, preferring clothing that just seems to blend into whatever the rest of the world would expect a random Joe to look like.%0a%3c %0a%3c || %25color=#FF4B0F%25Height:||5'7"|| %25color=#FFEF0D%25Weight:||125lbs|| %25color=#FF4B0F%25Complexion:||Tanned|| %25color=#FFEF0D%25Hair Color:||Black||%0a%3c || %25color=#FF4B0F%25Eye Color:||Emerald Green|| %25color=#FFEF0D%25Date of Birth:||10/31/1994|| %25color=#FF4B0F%25Place of Birth:||Miami|| %25color=#FFEF0D%25Accent:||Southern||%0a%3c || %25color=#FF4B0F%25Build Type:||Lean|| %25color=#FFEF0D%25Scars:||None || %25color=#FF4B0F%25Tattoos:||None || %25color=#FFEF0D%25Piercings:||None||%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25https://i.imgur.com/XQoNQr4.png%0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #8B008B' margin-top=0px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=25px width=150px height=150px%25https://i.imgur.com/eGOeAYq.jpg%0a%3c Nevaeh's skin darkens with the hint of what would eventually become fur, but instead is just coarse hair, thin as it is over most of her body.
