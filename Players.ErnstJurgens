He is known to have several students at a time, all working on various projects under his supervision.  Many members of the Dying Light rose under his tutalege, many more washed out.

He will push you to your limits. Mental, physical, and spiritual.  Mundane mortal ethics and morals are barriers to be broken, when they stand in the way of effective and enlightening research.  Even Kindred conventions may need to be ignored or circumvented when they stand in the way of good science and knowledge. When mentoring, he’s known to push his students down darker, more amoral paths.  Paths, he often says, are left unexplored due to “weak hearts and squeamish stomachs”.
