Dressed comfortably for work more often than style, with an old fashioned aesthetic of suspenders and chambray work shirts, jeans and simple, wide-brimmed sunhats. Dressed up, he favours three-piece suits and old-style hats, preferring darker tones of blue, green, red and earth-tone brown. His eyes are always bright and smiling, and he carries a constant air of calm and relaxation about him. Somehow the big man has grown even more muscular and sculpted, evident in whatever he wears, even if it is bespoke. %0a%0a%0a%0a!!%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/S1bkmYl.png%0a%0a%0a%25left%25Standing at exactly seven feet in height, Ascian is a literal golden-skinned adonis. Created to be physically 'perfect', and sculpted from magic wrought flesh into something other, his form and musculature fit to the Vitruvian ideal. His skin is a deep, almost golden bronze in colour, offset by sandy blond hair and bright, dancing green eyes. Ascian moves with incredible grace and poise, raw physical potential evident in every movement, or even standing at ease. As in his mask, the giant is now even more muscular and sculpted. However, his face is forever fixed in a curious, wondering gaze, taking everything in the same way that a child might. Indeed, for all his potential capacity, he looks upon the world with largely innocent eyes, though with time understanding and knowledge have entered his gaze. Still, delight is evident and obvious in his everyday expressions. Where once his body was composed entirely of bronze, it has taken on a new, golden luster of late, his metal form now made of Orichalcum. The title of Crimson Lance rests about his brow like a circlet of fire. %0a%0aArtwork done by: https://twitter.com/reed93886397%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25lfloat width=300px%25https://i.imgur.com/yK1Dz0G.jpg %0a%0a!!!%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/heQcjNW.png%0a%0a%25left%25Ascian's mantle hints at the expectant energy right before a summer squall, periodic whiffs of rain and ozone, the sense of a calm that belies the next few moments.  The weight of summer rides along his shoulders like the still heat of a highway in the desert, or the heavy air before the lightning strikes. A ribbon of light winds it's way around his upper arms and shoulders, adding to his serene expression. When in the grip of summer, they spread out like wings across his back. In recent days it has changed, bringing with it the crisp smell of Autumn with it, the warmth and safety of a fireside hearth on a cold, fall night, and the sense of richness and bounty that come with harvest time. %0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a%25rfloat width=300px%25https://i.imgur.com/LIGkUTy.png%0a%0a!!%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/bN6oBvc.png%0a%0a!!!!%25color=669966%25 ''Fields and Furrows (Everyone, Agriculturists)'': %0aAscian is openly a farmer, maybe you want to talk about soil or plants. Maybe you want to discuss details of some farmer's markets. Maybe you want to talk about the legalization of certain plants. Also, want to get out of town for a bit, or work off some issues with a bit of hard labour? A farm is a good way to do all of this.%0a%0a!!!!%25color=C32148%25 ''Old Souled (Everyone, %25changeling%25Changeling)'': %0aAscian has an enjoyment of what might be considered older things. %0aEarly to mid-twentieth-century clothing, art, music, and dancing is something that%0ahe is enthusiastic about. To the changelings, this fascination is a show of %0athe temporal weirdness of Faerie, not really dating the man but hinting to his life before.%0a%0a!!!!%25color=669966%25 ''Bank your fire %25changeling%25(Changeling)'': %0aFor being a Summer, Ascian has a preference for keeping things as neutral as he can between people. Maybe it's a sense of not wanting to cause problems when not necessary, maybe it's a sense of keeping his energy for when things really go wrong.
