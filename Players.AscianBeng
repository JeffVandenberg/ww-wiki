Dressed comfortably for work more often than style, with an old fashioned aesthetic of suspenders and chambray work shirts, jeans and simple, wide brimmed sunhats. Dressed up he favors three piece suits and old style hats, preferring darker tones of blue, green, red and earth tone brown. His eyes are always bright and smiling, and he carries a constant air of calm and relaxation about him. %0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Mein''%0a%0a%25center%25Standing at exactly seven feet in height, Ascian is a literal bronze skinned adonis. Created to be physically 'perfect', and sculpted from magic wrought flesh into something other, his form and musculature fit to the Vitruvian ideal. His skin is a deep, almost golden bronze in color, offset by sandy blond hair and bright, dancing green eyes. Ascian moves with incredible grace and poise, raw physical potential evident in every movement, or even standing at ease. However, his face is forever fixed in a curious, wondering gaze, taking everything in the same way that a child might. Indeed, for all his potential capacity, he looks upon the world with largely innocent eyes, though with time understanding and knowledge have entered his gaze. Still, delight is evident and obvious in his everyday expressions.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Mantle''%0a%0a%25center%25 Ascian's mantle hints at the expectant energy right before a summer squall, periodic whiffs of rain and ozone, the sense of a calm that belies the next few moments.  %0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''Hooks'''%0a%0a!!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''Fields and Furrows (Everyone, Agriculturists)'': %0aAscian is openly a farmer, maybe you want to talk about soil or plants.
