He tends not to mince words, preferring to say what he means.  He's usually personable and friendly, open to meeting people and making allies.  This only changes when violence is involved.  When he's looking through the scope of his rifle, he's quiet and focused.  He's mission focused, sometimes even remarking that when it comes to a mission or his own survival?  The mission comes first. %0a---%0a> This is stuff about my personality!%0a

He's not overly muscular but he's defined, built to move and fashioned for speed and mobility.  He tends to dress in dark tones, usually black, keeping his wardrobe mostly plain and utilitarian. Dennis is quiet, intense.  He says what he thinks and means what he says.  He's been known to lose his temper... how much of that was the blood in his veins is up to interpretation%0a---%0a> %25center%25[Enter Here]%0a
