Father Luna blesses each of us with an auspice, a duty in the ''Siskur-Dah'' our sacred hunt. Through the blessing of the Moon we find our place in the pack and in the world. Our dedication to Mother Wolf's duty so impressed her many of her Firstborn children, and they bless our tribes, each dedicated to hunting a specific prey. Beyond those groups, we have the pack monsters and humans that hunt as one to kill even the most powerful prey. \\%0a%0a\\%0aWe band together because we must. No werewolf can hunt alone. It goes against our nature, against our very being. We must be part of something beyond ourselves to succeed in the hunt. A pack can stalk from the shadows, run the prey to ground, then tear it limb from limb. A pack can share expertise, knowing the best way to hunt whether we stalk spirits or ''shartha''. A pack can hold a hunting ground, giving us a territory where we have the advantage. A pack's human members provide links to the human world, giving us ties to the communities we grew up in but that we can no longer be a part of.%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a!%25center%25%25werewolf%25'''The Packs'''%25%25%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25''[[Players/SwampRunners | Swamp Runners]]''%0a!!!!!%25center%25'''The Swamp Alpha Pack'''%0a%0a|| border=0%0a||!

One dubs herself La Llorona, a spirit of loss and violence that draws power from the death of the despondent, while the other is a spirit of compassion whose name best translates in English to the Blue Angel.  The two spirits and their choirs are at war for dominance, and their conflict ripples through the city.%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25''The Atlantic Court''%0aWild and untamed, most of these spirits make the oceanic landscape inhospitable.  There are even areas in the city itself that are untenable as remnants of the courts of Hurricanes still beat and batter at the bastion of the city.

Chock full of spirits of aggression, addiction and other strange and wild emotions the choir runs rampant, fueling the stories that inspired their emergence.%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25''Solar Court''%0aWhile the Celestial choirs do not deal with their flesh-bound cousins often as a matter of course, it is known that the Helions which watch over the city pay closer attention than usual to the children of Father Wolf that dwell there.  Zenith LLC's choice in pack totem - an Illuminator of some power within the court - has caught their eye, ensuring that they are watching to make sure that their brother is treated with the proper respect by ''all'' of the Forsaken, and woe betide those that think they don't have an uphill battle to climb if they attempt to follow in Zenith's footsteps.%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25''Swamp Court''%0aDark, angryï¿½painfulï¿½full of wrathï¿½  Think Heavy Metal on steroids, then throw it into a particle accelerator, set it to puree, and put it into the mold of an ancient alligator.

Dr. Fairchild was known for traveling the world in search of useful plants, but he was also an educator and a renowned scientist. At the age of 22, he created the Section of Foreign Seed and Plant Introduction of the United States Department of Agriculture, and for the next 37 years he traveled the world in search of plants of potential use to the American people.  In 1898, David Fairchild established the USDA Plant Introduction Garden in Florida and continued to travel and explore to add to the ever-growing collection.  What the history books leave out, of course, is that David Fairchild was a Ithaeur Bone Shadow, and the travels his team undertook were cover for his packï¿½s movements to better study the Hisil and its denizens around the world.%0a%0aUpon his retirement in 1935 Dr. Fairchild returned to Miami with his pack and they joined a group of passionate plant collectors and horticulturists, including retired accountant Col. Robert H. Montgomery (1872-1953), environmentalist Marjory Stoneman Douglas, County Commissioner Charles Crandon and landscape architect William Lyman Phillips. This core group worked tirelessly to bring the idea of a one of a kind botanic garden to life, and in 1938 the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden opened its 83 acres to the public for the first time. Col. Montgomery, who founded the Garden, named it to honor his friend. Many plants still growing in the Garden were collected by Dr. Fairchild, including a giant African baobab tree by the Gate House. In 1940, Dr. Fairchild embarked on the Garden's first official collecting expedition, sailing from the Philippines to the Indonesian archipelago on a special oceangoing Chinese junk called the Cheng Ho. The voyage provided many of the Garden's early botanical specimens before the outbreak of World War II forced the explorers to return home.%0a%0aDr Fairchild married Marian Hubbard Bell and the pair of them had two children, a son Graham Fairchild, and daughter Nancy Fairchild.  Upon his retirement a sizeable number of the family that was still living in Connecticut - where the American branch of the family line originated from well after their arrival from England in the 1630s - moved down to Florida to join the good doctor and help keep the Botanic Garden open and running smoothly.%0a%0aThe family developed a safe place for themselves called Kampong, located in Coconut Grove.  Marianï¿½s sister & her husband Gilbert Grosvenor bought the property to the north that adjoined Kampong.  After David and Marian passed away Catherine Sweeney, a second cousin connected to the Fairchildï¿½s, bought the property and maintained its upkeep.  Others in the Sweeney family helped to develop the Pacific Tropical Botanical Garden (now National Tropical Botanical Garden) and now own the property, though it is still used by all those connected to the Fairchilds.%0a%0aThe blood of the Urfarah has always run deep in the family lines, with multiple Changes occurring each generation and a sizable number of wolf-blooded beyond that; the current generation boasts no less than four wolves and one blooded from one branch of the family alone, for example.  While some have decided to pack with family members exclusively others have branched out, making new bonds with other local Uratha to expand their own personal horizons.  Members of the family claim membership with all of the Forsaken tribes, although the Bone Shadows and Iron Masters see more prevalence.%0a%0a%0a%0a!!!!!%25center%25Other family names: Sweeney, Grosvenor, Bell%0a%0a%0a!!!!!%25center%25Head of the Family \\%0a%0a%25center%25'''Aubrey Fairchild(nee Grosvenor)'''  \\%0a%25center%25''Bone Shadows Elodoth'' \\%0aWife/Mate to Evan Fairchild.

Working for Henry Flagler, Sewell served as foreman and superintendent for the Florida East Coast Railway during the construction of the line from Jacksonville to Miami and later joined the hotel construction department. After helping to construct The Royal Poinciana Hotel and The Breakers Hotel at Palm Beach, Sewell moved to Miami in 1896 to work on the Royal Palm Hotel. While working on the hotel, Sewell stumbled upon the burial grounds of the Tequesta Native-Americans. Sewell gave away some of the skulls as souvenirs, and ordered African-American laborers to move the remaining bones and bury them in a hole, he did this to see if he could provoke some of the local Native American Spirits into showing themselves. Sewell remained in the employ of the Florida East Coast Railway until 1899, when he left to concentrate his efforts on the mercantile establishment jointly owned with this brother. He was Mayor of the City of Miami from 1903 to 1907.%0a%0aAfter serving in local politics, Sewell began the construction of his family home in 1912. Built on the highest point in the city, the house was named Halissee Hall from the Seminole word meaning "New Moon." He married a young Hunter in Darkness Elodoth named Mary Jones, having six children over the years.  Four made it to adulthood, two of whom followed in their parentsï¿½ footsteps under Lunaï¿½s light.%0a%0aSewell wrote a self-published autobiography entitled John Sewell's Memoirs and History of Miami, Florida. It included an appendix describing his witnessing the attempted assassination of president-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933. The book is valuable as a primary source of information on pioneer days in Miami.  Upon his death he was buried in Miami City Cemetery.%0a%0aJohnï¿½s brother Everest George "E. G." Sewell ( September 17, 1874 ï¿½ April 2, 1940) opened their first business north of the Miami River on March 26, 1896. In February 1916 he was elected as president of Miami Chamber of Commerce and was re-elected every year until 1925 (except for 1919). He was elected as Mayor of Miami in 1927, 1933, and twice in 1939 (once as a recall and one during a proper election).  While EG never changed he use his power as mayor to cover up incidents that would have exposed the local Uratha to undue scrutiny.%0a%0aEG married a young woman named Lucinda Blackwell, an Elodoth of the Iron Masters whom he met when she worked in his first store.  She was with him every step of the way on his political career, helping him and acting as the perfect Mayor's wife.  She gave him a total of seven children, but only three made it to adulthood.  Only one of the children, a young man named George, changed under the full moon and chose to join the Hunters in Darkness. EG died two days after suffering a heart attack on April 2, 1940 at Jackson Memorial Hospital, and was honored by having a nature park in Miami named after him.%0a%0aWhile not as Uratha-rich as the Fairchilds the Sewell family lines still boast a notable number of Blooded, with a network of connections forged between different packs in the area through pack bond, marriage or both.

Halissee Hall was acquired by the University of Miami in 1932 and over the years the University of Miami School of Medicine and Jackson Memorial Hospital grew up around the former estate. In 1997, the Medical Faculty Association took the initiative to undertake a complete restoration of this National Historic Register structure. When completed, Halissee will be home to the School of Medicineï¿½s Faculty Club and will host receptions, conferences and lectures ï¿½ once again, entertaining men and women vital to the growth of Miami and South Florida.%0a%0aIt is known among the family that there is a series of tunnels under the University of Miami that allow the family access to their home on campus.  Some say that both brothers had a hand in building it as a way to move around in emergencies.

Immigration usually entails violation of ancestral ties and parental obligations. Dealing in their youths with convulsive change, thrown back on their own devices to create a productive existence, ripped untimely from the womb of a settled life, immigrants everywhere suffer the guilts of disconnection from their homes and families and ally easily with the forces of the future against the claims of the past. Shaped by a fractured or betrayed conservatism, however, the immigrant's most revolutionary creations usually reverberate with remembered values. In forging a new world, he continually restores the old.%0a%0aIn the history of the United States, each new flood of immigrants has enacted this essential drama of abandonment and rebuilding. But in recent years, no group has played it out with the energy and resourcefulness of the Cubans who fled Castro's Cuba in rage and fear and settled first in Miami, Florida.%0a%0aThe city did not seem ready for them. For the economy of central Miami, 1961 was a grim year. In the inner-city area around the Tamiami Trail, more than 1,000 homes with Federal Housing Administration mortgages had been vacated, and many were vandalized for their copper pipe and electrical fixtures. Local shops gasped for customers and went broke; 40-year-old Burdine's, the chief downtown department store, was languishing helplessly as its clientele moved toward the suburbs. Even Miami Beach, the supreme American resort across the Bay of Biscayne, was slipping perceptibly past its prime, as wealthy northern tourists increasingly passed it by for mellower island shores to the south.%0a%0aTo many observers, the arrival of the Cubans seemed a deadly blow to the city's hope for recovery. Some 200,000 had already fled Castro's burgeoning dictatorship, and more arrived daily. Castro had proclaimed a new law of potestas patria under which he was abolishing Catholic schools, establishing centers for communist indoctrination, incarcerating dissidents, and commandeering lawyers and other white-collar people for labor in the sugar fields. Refugees flocked the Miami airport in painful confusion then clustered five or more to a room in Miami bungalows and apartments, looking for jobs that didnï¿½t exist in the struggling Dade County economy and confidently awaiting deliveranceï¿½and vicarious vengeanceï¿½through a brutal charge of US Marines onto the beaches of Cuba, ordered by America's macho new president, John F. Kennedy.%0a%0aSome 13,000 of the immigrants came as unaccompanied children, landing in Miami without kin, a grasp of the English language, and many with only a vague connection in the United States. They had been packed off by desperate parents and left to be processed in refugee camps and then passed on to orphanages and foster homes. Many of the immigrants of all ages were channeled first to other communities, but most of them gravitated back to southern Florida, the area closest to their prior home and most acculturated with Cubans.%0a%0aAll statistical projections were dismal. Experts foresaw a prolonged siege of medical crises, economic stresses, and ethnic frictions; a teeming burden of "social disorders," needs for housing, welfare, and simple hygieneï¿½an impossible load for the already afflicted social services of the city. Here in one economically stagnant urban area, over a period of just two years, thronged some 200,000 penurious immigrantsï¿½more than the total of black unemployed youths in all of America's urban areas at the time, concentrated in the hard core of one central city. It was an influx about one-fifth the size of the entire Dade County population in 1960, an inundation more rapid and overwhelming than any previous migration to one American city.%0a%0aFew of the arrivals spoke English, and virtually none had arranged for jobs or housing. Many had been reasonably well educated and well employed in Cuba, but their experience and credentials were often irrelevant in the United States. Doctors, architects, and lawyers escaped the sugar fields only to work as busboys, bootblacks, and parking-lot attendants. Nearly 60 percent of the exiles had been common laborers even in Cuba, and all had lost most of what they had accumulated at home. From the press coverage and political comment of the day it is difficult to find any observers who saw this human flood as anything but a tribulation for southern Florida or a problem to be solved by saviors at the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and the Immigration and Naturalization Serviceï¿½or the US Marines.%0a%0aThe Cubans' saviors, however, were already at hand: they would be saved by themselvesï¿½not chiefly by a trickle-down of grants from the government, but by the upsurge of their own productive efforts. They would be saved by people like Josï¿½ Palmero, penniless, having invested his last dollars in some second hand records to peddle door to door; by Armando Codina, then a frightened, gangly youth, with just two words of English, hamburger and Coke, assigned to a refugee camp.%0a%0aArmando Cordina settled in among the others in what would soon be called Little Havana.  Armando himself fled for the same reason many of the others did.  While most of them had what folks would consider proper jobs back in Cuba, Armandoï¿½s skill set lay in the more ï¿½greyï¿½ area.  He was, however, very charismatic and used the connections with his ï¿½familyï¿½ back home to gather other orphans of the crisis under his wing and start a proper trade in the less legal pleasures of life.   They started first with weed in small batches and some cocaine and cigars, later expanding to other narcotics as the market grew.  Armando pressed upon his newfound family that they find legitimate cover jobs to explain where their money came from, however, and most did: gophers, day laborers, sanitation work and child care helped to cover their tracks and offer additional income to the group besides.  %0a%0aNot long after his arrival a local cigar owner, Roy Shapiro, took a chance on Armando and hired the youth at his store Viva Cigar Lounge.  Soon he noticed Armandoï¿½s abilities with rolling cigars by hand and was quite happy with the money made off the counterfeit Cuban cigars that he and his friends rolled.  Armando put his nose to the grindstone, splitting his time between the store, the business handled by his ï¿½familyï¿½ and the side business that fueled everything else.  When Roy decided to ï¿½retireï¿½ to Palm Springs he sold the store to Armando, trusting the young man to continue the good work he had been doing there.  %0a%0aWith the store now in the hands of the Cordina Family they flourished, using the steady supply of Cuban cigars they were able to get in around the embargo to their advantage.  Armando pioneered a near-foolproof technique for cutting some of the actual Cubans with normal cigars, mixing the tobacco within before rerolling and relabeling them to near perfection to increase their stock of the product and adding to their profits.  As far as the public saw, Armando Cordina and his family seemed like a typical success story.  They had come here from Cuba with nothing, and with the successful business plan they opened two more Viva Cigar stores, both in prominent hotels in the area owned by the Sewell family.%0a  %0aIn the 80ï¿½s when another flood of Cubans came to Miami, the familyï¿½s ranks swelled as many of those whoï¿½d come over in the 60ï¿½s asked their families to join them, bringing in more and more connections.  Armando helped send many of the children born in Miami to good schools and on to college using the grey money to fund it.  In return he got well educated young Uratha and blooded to help protect the family, keeping as much as he could in house  With their help he kept up the drug running and was able to bring in new shipment lines from Cuba down into Miami.%0a%0aArmando had already Changed under the Half Moon back in Cuba, leaving behind his pack as they were not able to make the journey himself.  A number of the motley crew that he had assorted upon his arrival was also touched by the Moon, having gone through the Change as well or showed tells of being blooded.  A core part of the now-extended family still maintains this tie to the Urfarah, with the Storm Lords and Iron Masters most prominent.%0a   %0a%0a!!!!!%25center%25Other family names: Palmero, Oyarzun, Valls%0a%0a%0a!!!!!%25center%25Head of the Family \\%0a%0a%25center%25'''Armando Codina'''  \\%0a%25center%25''Storm Lord Elodoth'' \\%0aOne of the elder statesmen among the urban Uratha of Miami, the Elodoth does his best to keep his sonï¿½s ambitions in check as well as those of the other packmates. Finding the balance in what they do and how they act so as not to have the law after them and yet continue to grow the family and the empire behind it is key to their current survival, and woe betide anyone who threatens whatï¿½s his.  %0a%0a!!!!!Rest of the Family%0a*'''Mateo Codina'''%0a**''Iron Master Rahu''%0a**While Armando is the head of the family, his eldest son and second in command is chomping at the bit, canines just shy of his own father's throat for the position of Alpha. Mateo feels that the family, the pack, are not doing enough. Sure they are doing well and making a name for themselves but they need to push for more. Mateo wants to bring in even more people for the family, push bigger volumes of drugs, push more than just cigars and some cocaine, why not heroin? Why not weapons? The young Rahu is hungry for all that could be, and the firm hand of his father upon his ambitions only serves to stir the anger in his heart.%0a*'''Diego Palmero'''%0a**''Iron Master Cahalith''%0a**Diego Palermo, the resident Cahalith, is one of the best pushers there could be. The guy could sell ice to the best ice salesman there was. Always a smile on his face, and one of very few Uratha to ever stay overweight; he is almost constantly snacking, usually with a bag of potato chips on him somewhere. On the streets he goes by The Slug, because when he passes you drugs he's always got some sort of food substance on his hands that comes with, leaving their hands a slimy mess after the exchange.%0a*'''Zelia Codina'''%0a**''Storm Lord Ithaeur''%0a**Is any pack really complete without an Ithaeur? This one sure wouldn't be. Zelia is the financial brains of the operation behind her father Armando, handling the various accounts and ensuring that the streams of income that shouldnï¿½t touch donï¿½t.  She watches her brother Mateo just as warily as Armando does, careful to not get looped into his schemes.%0a%0a%0a%0a!!!!!'''Property''' %0a%0a!!!!!'''Viva Cigars'''%0aThe center of the family business, Viva Cigars has been turning out quality product for over fifty years.  The main location is still located in Little Havana in a well-kept building that houses both the production and sales of the cigars, the entire process watched with a careful eye by the family to ensure that the store's reputation stays tip top.  Cigars produced at this location are sent to the other stores in the city, along with some orders that are shipped out to customers outside of the city.%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!%25center%25%25werewolf%25'''The Oaths of the Moon'''%25%25%0a%0aWerewolves are creatures of burning passions. Theirs is a lust for life few humans can understand. They hunt to survive. They feel the rush of blood in their veins and from the open wounds of their prey. Death intertwines with life, and fury with joy. Bound not by human authority or morality, they are monsters who hunt monsters. Without a guiding purpose, many would descend into atavistic madness. All Forsaken have a purpose, however: the Oath of the Moon, sworn to their moon-god/dess in the name of their dead Father.%0a%0aThe Oath binds Uratha to a code of savage harmony. It defines ''Siskur-Dah'', the legacy of ''Urfarah''. It helps Lunaï¿½s shapeshifting brood find its place in a world of animistic duality. Above all, the Oath is a weapon against degeneration into a mindless beast. By the Oath are Forsaken lifted above half-blind humans and mere wolves and spirits. Through it they gain strength, a creed, and an outlet through which to express their dedication. Even the Pure swear a version of the Oath, though each tribe has its own variations, and none of the ''Anshega'' would ever swear it to Luna. Other spirits, those that hate the Forsaken for their role in the death of ''Urfarah'', judge each Pure based on the form of the Oath that he took.  The Oath is a silver chain binding the monster. Yet it also drives those it binds to be better than they are. Mother Luna watches over her children still, and they know it through the presence of Lunes, the mad moon spirits. Lunes judge the Oath, exalting its champions and condemning its transgressors. Each of the Lunes is as bipolar as its mother, and while one might decry a werewolf for not upholding the Oath strongly enough, it might also barely react when she achieves a great success. No one said adhering to a creed of primeval hunters and capricious spirits would ever be easy.%0a%0aNot all punishments come from the Lunes. Werewolves who reject the Oath become lost in the hunt without guidance or support from the Firstborn. Some reject the Oath out of wickedness, and so become little more than cunning beasts who sometimes wear human skin. Ignoring the Oath is a sure way to lose oneï¿½s grip on the things that make the Uratha who, rather than what, they are. Without balance, werewolves can become trapped in one form or even one world. In time, they forget even what they once were, becoming as single-minded and inflexible as spirits.%0a%0aSeveral tenets comprise the Oath. Each tribe (indeed, each pack) places greater importance on some of the laws than it does the others. The added significance is in regard to tribeï¿½s favored prey and its view of a proper world. Some werewolves pay only lip service to one tenet. The more devout take every law as sacred. In the end, not even her packmates can determine how a werewolf approaches the Oath; it is a decision she must make for herself.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''Urum Da Takus'''%0a!!!!%25center%25''The Wolf Must Hunt''%0a*No werewolf can transgress against this tenet, for it is the beating heart of his existence. The People hunt. They revere Siskur-Dahas their most holy purpose. To them, it is not just a way of life; the hunt is life. It is Father Wolfï¿½s greatest legacy.  Only werewolves can hunt like Urfarahonce did. Every pack has its own rituals of the hunt, as does every Ghost Wolf. Like any religious law, this tenet is a point of contention among rivals and enemies. A packï¿½s solemn duty is to hunt, whether things of flesh or spirit or both. Failure to do so causes other packs to doubt the packï¿½s commitment, using it as an excuse (real or feigned) to move on its territory. Bloody clashes under the moon usually follow, threatening the sanctity of the Oathï¿½s next most important clause.%0a!!!%25center%25'''Imru Nu Fir Imru'''%0a!!!!%25center%25''The People Do Not Murder The People''%0a*A subject of many tribal debates and heated blood feuds, this tenet says that murdering other Uratha is a grave sin. It is both specific and ambiguous, which of course only adds to the confusion. Most agree the law makes it taboo to kill anyone with the blood of the Wolf except at great need. Many Uratha think of Wolf-Blooded and human pack members as part of the People, and thus their lives are equally sacred.  Nearly as many interpretations of this law exist as there are packs in the world. Open challenges of dominance resulting in accidental death might be considered acceptable to some, while murder of an unaware victim is a heinous crime. Lunes offer little help interpreting the law, their words every bit as contradictory as clashing Forsaken beliefs. Most werewolves assume that beating another werewolf is acceptable within the Oath. Slaying a defeated foe is murder. Killing when unnecessary ï¿½ whether prey or fellow werewolf ï¿½ is a sin, especially when the victim is one of your own kind. Elodoth argue with their packs and with one another about whether or not the law includes the Pure Tribes. Some Pure seem to believe that killing Forsaken is taboo, although torture doesnï¿½t violate the law. Likewise, some Forsaken refuse to kill the Pure except when the Pure would murder them, and even then sing their lament to wolf and moon.%0a!!!%25center%25'''Sih Sehe Mak; Mak Ne Sih'''%0a!!!!%25center%25''The Low Honor The High; The High Respect The Low''%0a*Uratha are intimately familiar with dominance and submission. Many humans and spirits feign distaste at the idea, but they, too, abide by hierarchies. The world simply wonï¿½t allow equality for everyone, and the Forsaken know it. If the prey is stronger than the pack, the pack must bring it to its level. If one pack is stronger than another, the stronger will wins out. It is the law of the wild. Younger werewolves with heads full of pride rebuke the authority of the elders. They feel the elders enforce this law, or perhaps made it up entirely, simply to wield power. In turn, the elders bear their scars, sing of their bloody glories, and take what they feel is their due. Wise elders know that the second half of the clause demands they show respect for pups and young hunters, and afford their less experienced kin that respect. Even the old and strong can have their throats torn out by angry pups. Attitudes toward this law vary within protectorates. In some, elders are given proper deference both for their ability as hunters and their wisdom as Forsaken. Some grow cruel or brutal. They fall out of balance and meet their ends at the claws of the oppressed. Some keep young werewolves in line when even the Oath canï¿½t always guide them. All respect the Firstborn and the ways that the Forsaken have followed since prehistory. If wise elders know that they should respect the young hunters, then wise pups know to respect the scarred veterans for their knowledge and prowess.%0a!!!%25center%25'''Ni Daha'''%0a!!!!%25center%25''Respect You Prey''%0a***Humans long ago abandoned this law and suffer for it. Werewolves fully know the dangers of imbalance. Their ability to hunt suffers. Their territories fall into decline. They grow weak, as did Urfarahin his final days, and soon meet their ends. Wisdom teaches that werewolves should respect their prey. Strong prey shapes strong predators, and vice versa. It is a precarious balance. A pack that kills callously gains enemies among spirits who see them as cruel barbarians. Indifference to the deaths of animals and spirits leads to losing respect for the hunt itself. A true predator kills out of necessity, not mere desire. Respect your prey, and it in turn respects your place as its predator. Spirits lash out at needlessly vicious werewolves, but those who properly respect the hunt earn the Shadowï¿½s begrudging respect as a necessary part of the natural order. Even the most selfish spirits can recognize the honor and savage nobility of the Uratha.  Some Uratha take this a step further. When one of these werewolves kills a deer, she understands that the animal has given its life that hers can continue. She respects the weight of the act. For most, killing is simply about necessity. Creatures like the Hosts and Claimed must be killed before they kill werewolves in turn. Respecting your prey means respecting the need for werewolves to hunt it. These creatures are deadly monsters in their own right.  Even humans are not exempt from Uratha predation, something which younger werewolves often have difficulty grasping. Humans can be prey, and in many cases must be, though the Oath forbids consumption of human flesh. Older werewolves, and those who quickly take to their roles as the ultimate predators, feel no more remorse for killing humans than they do for any other creature. Merciful werewolves might warn humans off first through various terrifying means. Just as many kill them as readily as they would their next meal.%0a!!!%25center%25'''Nu Hu Uzuz Eren'''%0a!!!!%25center%25''Do Not Eat The Flesh Of Man Or Wolf''%0a*The act provides power and pleasure, a rush of Essence and a perverse satisfaction of basest urges. It is a surrender of honor and control, and no meat is sweeter upon the tongue of a hungry werewolf. The rush of power is too much, though. To a werewolf, eating her own kind, or her close kin, is a grave temptation that also drags her closer to the spirit than the flesh.  Forsaken lorekeepers have long wondered at the truth of the matter. This clause is one of the oldest and certainly the clearest. Some Uratha then wonder if the temptation has always existed, deliberately left by the mad moon-goddess or born in Father Wolfï¿½s death at the claws and teeth of his own progeny. Perhaps it is an eternal reminder of that grave act. Whatever its origin, it remains a temptation and a threat to a werewolfï¿½s soul. In the throes of Kuruth, even the most disciplined Uratha might devour her kill and remember the taste through the mists of Rage. No werewolf is safe from this temptation, even those who have never tasted the power of the sweetest meats.%0a!!!%25center%25'''Nu Bath Githul'''%0a!!!!%25center%25''The Herd Must Not Know''%0a*Werewolves are mightier than any human, but not invincible. Angry, determined humans threaten even a pack. %0aGuns and bombs quickly even up the score, and those few hunters capable of standing against the Uratha know some of their weaknesses. Younger werewolves laugh at the thought, thinking themselves immortal. This law protects against that headstrong thinking; it was born of a need to protect werewolves, not humans. A large-scale war between humans and werewolves would end badly for the werewolves. Even if the Uratha won a protracted war against their human kin, the results would devastate the world. Cunning werewolves stick to the shadows, hunting at night or across the Gauntlet. While itï¿½s easy to dismiss ï¿½Bigfoot sightingsï¿½ and isolated animal attacks, danger follows increased scrutiny. Werewolves already face enough challenges on the hunt.%0a!!!%25center%25'''Uratha Safal Thil Lu'u'''%0a!!!!%25center%25''The Uratha Shall Cleave To The Human''%0a*Uratha mate among themselves and humans. They count humans among their packs, including the Wolf-Blooded. While they feel kinship with wolves, they crave socialization among humans. It grounds them, keeps them in touch with humanity, helps them maintain balance. Werewolves cannot forsake their human sides, lest they become remorseless monsters as selfish as spirits.%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!%25center%25%25werewolf%25'''Tribal Vows'''%25%25%0a%0aThe Firstborn stand apart from other spirits as the great totems of Uratha tribes. First among the children of Urfarah, the Firstborn exemplify different aspects of Siskur-Dah. They are older siblings and guides to the Forsaken. Their patronage provides knowledge, and tools to hunt specific prey. In turn the tribes honor their totems with vows sworn to the Oath of the Moon in their names. %0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''Nu sum ghumur nu su ghid'''-Blood Talon%0a!!!!%25center%25''Offer No Surrender You Would Not Accept''%0a*The Blood Talons lead violent lives even for werewolves. They offer no quarter and seek none. Sworn on Fenris-Urï¿½s name is this oath: to offer no dishonorable surrender, and to accept none from their enemies. Blood Talons stand at the forefront of Uratha conflicts, where baring their throats means worse than death: It means ''weakness''.%0a!!!%25center%25'''Su a sar-hith sa'''-Bone Shadow%0a!!!!%25center%25''Pay Each Spirit in Kind''%0a*Bone Shadows know that their path leads them through darkness, death, and terrible secrets. They stalk the Shadow, hunting the things that would hunt them. Sworn on ''Kamduis-Urï¿½s'' name is this oath: to pay each spirit with claw and ''gathra'', respect and rage. The Bone Shadows know what horrors await them if the Uratha grow weak.%0a!!!%25center%25'''Nu mus halhala'''-Hunters in Darkness%0a!!!!%25center%25''Let No Sacred Place in Your Territory Be Violated''%0a*Hunters in Darkness hold their territories sacred in a way other tribes donï¿½t understand. It is the land in which the ''Meninna'' are supreme, the apex predators. Theirs is an ancient legacy borne proudly in their savage hearts. Sworn in ''Hikaon-Urï¿½s'' name is this oath: to never let friend or foe violate the Hunterï¿½s territory unchallenged. The ''Meninna'' shape their ''mus-rahin'' service to the hunt; a violation of that ground is a violation of the Hunterï¿½s very devotion.%0a!!!%25center%25'''Kul kisura udmeda'''-Iron Master%0a!!!!%25center%25''Honor Your Territory in All Things''%0a*The Iron Masters know that change is the only constant. The world tomorrow might only resemble todayï¿½s world in passing. The Iron Masters know that they must adapt to the world. They ever search for ways to master their realm. Sworn in ''Sagrim-Urï¿½s'' name is this oath: to remember that which defines a werewolf even in the face of change.%0a!!!%25center%25'''Nu si gid namtar'''-Storm Lord%0a!!!!%25center%25''Allow No One to Witness or to Tend Your Weakness''%0a*Presence and power mean everything to the Storm Lords. They must stand as giants among their kin. To their enemies and to their rivals alike they show no weakness. To the ''Iminir'' themselves, they ''have'' no weakness. Storm Lords hold themselves to a higher standard, such that when anyone looks upon the face of the Uratha, they see a fearless wolf. Sworn in ''Skolis-Urï¿½s'' name is this oath: to remain unbreakable in service to the hunt.%0a%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a(:include GameRef.Directoryhelp:)

Dr. Fairchild was known for traveling the world in search of useful plants, but he was also an educator and a renowned scientist. At the age of 22, he created the Section of Foreign Seed and Plant Introduction of the United States Department of Agriculture, and for the next 37 years he traveled the world in search of plants of potential use to the American people.  In 1898, David Fairchild established the USDA Plant Introduction Garden in Florida and continued to travel and explore to add to the ever-growing collection.  What the history books leave out, of course, is that David Fairchild was a Ithaeur Bone Shadow, and the travels his team undertook were cover for his packs movements to better study the Hisil and its denizens around the world.%0a%3c %0a%3c Upon his retirement in 1935 Dr. Fairchild returned to Miami with his pack and they joined a group of passionate plant collectors and horticulturists, including retired accountant Col. Robert H. Montgomery (1872-1953), environmentalist Marjory Stoneman Douglas, County Commissioner Charles Crandon and landscape architect William Lyman Phillips. This core group worked tirelessly to bring the idea of a one of a kind botanic garden to life, and in 1938 the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden opened its 83 acres to the public for the first time. Col. Montgomery, who founded the Garden, named it to honor his friend. Many plants still growing in the Garden were collected by Dr. Fairchild, including a giant African baobab tree by the Gate House. In 1940, Dr. Fairchild embarked on the Garden's first official collecting expedition, sailing from the Philippines to the Indonesian archipelago on a special oceangoing Chinese junk called the Cheng Ho. The voyage provided many of the Garden's early botanical specimens before the outbreak of World War II forced the explorers to return home.%0a%3c %0a%3c Dr Fairchild married Marian Hubbard Bell and the pair of them had two children, a son Graham Fairchild, and daughter Nancy Fairchild.  Upon his retirement a sizeable number of the family that was still living in Connecticut - where the American branch of the family line originated from well after their arrival from England in the 1630s - moved down to Florida to join the good doctor and help keep the Botanic Garden open and running smoothly.%0a%3c %0a%3c The family developed a safe place for themselves called Kampong, located in Coconut Grove.  Marians sister & her husband Gilbert Grosvenor bought the property to the north that adjoined Kampong.  After David and Marian passed away Catherine Sweeney, a second cousin connected to the Fairchilds, bought the property and maintained its upkeep.  Others in the Sweeney family helped to develop the Pacific Tropical Botanical Garden (now National Tropical Botanical Garden) and now own the property, though it is still used by all those connected to the Fairchilds.%0a%3c %0a%3c The blood of the Urfarah has always run deep in the family lines, with multiple Changes occurring each generation and a sizable number of wolf-blooded beyond that; the current generation boasts no less than four wolves and one blooded from one branch of the family alone, for example.  While some have decided to pack with family members exclusively others have branched out, making new bonds with other local Uratha to expand their own personal horizons.  Members of the family claim membership with all of the Forsaken tribes, although the Bone Shadows and Iron Masters see more prevalence.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> David Fairchild (1869-1954) was born in Lansing, Michigan, and was raised in Manhattan, Kansas.

For the economy of central Miami, 1961 was a grim year. In the inner-city area around the Tamiami Trail, more than 1,000 homes with Federal Housing Administration mortgages had been vacated, and many were vandalized for their copper pipe and electrical fixtures. Local shops gasped for customers and went broke; 40-year-old Burdine's, the chief downtown department store, was languishing helplessly as its clientele moved toward the suburbs. Even Miami Beach, the supreme American resort across the Bay of Biscayne, was slipping perceptibly past its prime, as wealthy northern tourists increasingly passed it by for mellower island shores to the south.%0a%3c %0a%3c To many observers, the arrival of the Cubans seemed a deadly blow to the city's hope for recovery. Some 200,000 had already fled Castro's burgeoning dictatorship, and more arrived daily. Castro had proclaimed a new law of potestas patria under which he was abolishing Catholic schools, establishing centers for communist indoctrination, incarcerating dissidents, and commandeering lawyers and other white-collar people for labor in the sugar fields. Refugees flocked the Miami airport in painful confusion then clustered five or more to a room in Miami bungalows and apartments, looking for jobs that didnt exist in the struggling Dade County economy and confidently awaiting deliveranceand vicarious vengeancethrough a brutal charge of US Marines onto the beaches of Cuba, ordered by America's macho new president, John F. Kennedy.%0a%3c %0a%3c Some 13,000 of the immigrants came as unaccompanied children, landing in Miami without kin, a grasp of the English language, and many with only a vague connection in the United States. They had been packed off by desperate parents and left to be processed in refugee camps and then passed on to orphanages and foster homes. Many of the immigrants of all ages were channeled first to other communities, but most of them gravitated back to southern Florida, the area closest to their prior home and most acculturated with Cubans.%0a%3c %0a%3c All statistical projections were dismal. Experts foresaw a prolonged siege of medical crises, economic stresses, and ethnic frictions; a teeming burden of "social disorders," needs for housing, welfare, and simple hygienean impossible load for the already afflicted social services of the city. Here in one economically stagnant urban area, over a period of just two years, thronged some 200,000 penurious immigrantsmore than the total of black unemployed youths in all of America's urban areas at the time, concentrated in the hard core of one central city. It was an influx about one-fifth the size of the entire Dade County population in 1960, an inundation more rapid and overwhelming than any previous migration to one American city.%0a%3c %0a%3c Few of the arrivals spoke English, and virtually none had arranged for jobs or housing. Many had been reasonably well educated and well employed in Cuba, but their experience and credentials were often irrelevant in the United States. Doctors, architects, and lawyers escaped the sugar fields only to work as busboys, bootblacks, and parking-lot attendants. Nearly 60 percent of the exiles had been common laborers even in Cuba, and all had lost most of what they had accumulated at home. From the press coverage and political comment of the day it is difficult to find any observers who saw this human flood as anything but a tribulation for southern Florida or a problem to be solved by saviors at the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and the Immigration and Naturalization Serviceor the US Marines.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Cubans' saviors, however, were already at hand: they would be saved by themselvesnot chiefly by a trickle-down of grants from the government, but by the upsurge of their own productive efforts. They would be saved by people like José Palmero, penniless, having invested his last dollars in some second hand records to peddle door to door; by Armando Codina, then a frightened, gangly youth, with just two words of English, hamburger and Coke, assigned to a refugee camp.%0a%3c %0a%3c Armando Cordina settled in among the others in what would soon be called Little Havana.  Armando himself fled for the same reason many of the others did.  While most of them had what folks would consider proper jobs back in Cuba, Armandos skill set lay in the more grey area.  He was, however, very charismatic and used the connections with his family back home to gather other orphans of the crisis under his wing and start a proper trade in the less legal pleasures of life.   They started first with weed in small batches and some cocaine and cigars, later expanding to other narcotics as the market grew.  Armando pressed upon his newfound family that they find legitimate cover jobs to explain where their money came from, however, and most did: gophers, day laborers, sanitation work and child care helped to cover their tracks and offer additional income to the group besides.  %0a%3c %0a%3c Not long after his arrival a local cigar owner, Roy Shapiro, took a chance on Armando and hired the youth at his store Viva Cigar Lounge.  Soon he noticed Armandos abilities with rolling cigars by hand and was quite happy with the money made off the counterfeit Cuban cigars that he and his friends rolled.  Armando put his nose to the grindstone, splitting his time between the store, the business handled by his family and the side business that fueled everything else.  When Roy decided to retire to Palm Springs he sold the store to Armando, trusting the young man to continue the good work he had been doing there.  %0a%3c %0a%3c With the store now in the hands of the Cordina Family they flourished, using the steady supply of Cuban cigars they were able to get in around the embargo to their advantage.  Armando pioneered a near-foolproof technique for cutting some of the actual Cubans with normal cigars, mixing the tobacco within before rerolling and relabeling them to near perfection to increase their stock of the product and adding to their profits.  As far as the public saw, Armando Cordina and his family seemed like a typical success story.  They had come here from Cuba with nothing, and with the successful business plan they opened two more Viva Cigar stores, both in prominent hotels in the area owned by the Sewell family.%0a%3c   %0a%3c In the 80s when another flood of Cubans came to Miami, the familys ranks swelled as many of those whod come over in the 60s asked their families to join them, bringing in more and more connections.  Armando helped send many of the children born in Miami to good schools and on to college using the grey money to fund it.  In return he got well educated young Uratha and blooded to help protect the family, keeping as much as he could in house  With their help he kept up the drug running and was able to bring in new shipment lines from Cuba down into Miami.%0a%3c %0a%3c Armando had already Changed under the Half Moon back in Cuba, leaving behind his pack as they were not able to make the journey himself.  A number of the motley crew that he had assorted upon his arrival was also touched by the Moon, having gone through the Change as well or showed tells of being blooded.  A core part of the now-extended family still maintains this tie to the Urfarah, with the Storm Lords and Iron Masters most prominent.%0a%3c    %0a%3c %0a---%0a> The city did not seem ready for them. For the economy of central Miami, 1961 was a grim year. In the inner-city area around the Tamiami Trail, more than 1,000 homes, with Federal Housing Administration mortgages, had been vacated, and many were vandalized for their copper pipe and electrical fixtures. Local shops gasped for customers and went broke; 40-year-old Burdine's, the chief downtown department store, was languishing helplessly as its clientele moved toward the suburbs. Even Miami Beach, the supreme American resort across the Bay of Biscayne, was slipping perceptibly past its prime, as wealthy northern tourists increasingly passed it by for mellower island shores to the south.%0a> %0a> To many observers, the arrival of the Cubans seemed a deadly blow to the city's hope for recovery. Some 200,000 had already fled Castro's burgeoning dictatorship, and more arrived daily. Castro had proclaimed a new law of potestas patria under which he was abolishing Catholic schools, establishing centers for communist indoctrination, incarcerating dissidents, and commandeering lawyers and other white-collar people for labor in the sugar fields. Refugees flocked the Miami airport, in painful confusion; then clustered five or more to a room in Miami bungalows and apartments, looking for jobs, nonexistent in the struggling Dade County economy, and confidently awaiting deliveranceâand vicarious vengeanceâthrough a brutal charge of US Marines onto the beaches of Cuba, ordered by America's macho new president, John F. Kennedy.%0a> %0a> Some 13,000 of the immigrants came as unaccompanied children, landing in Miami without kin, without English, and many with only a vague connection in the United States. They had been packed off by desperate parents and left to be processed in refugee camps and then passed on to orphanages and foster homes. Many of the immigrants of all ages were channeled first to other communities, but most of them gravitated back to southern Florida, the area closest to their prior home and most acculturated with Cubans.%0a> %0a> All statistical projections were dismal. Experts foresaw a prolonged siege of medical crises, economic stresses, and ethnic frictions; a teeming burden of "social disorders," needs for housing, welfare, and simple hygieneâan impossible load for the already afflicted social services of the city.

A few worked as day laborers, or looking over children.  %0a> %0a> Armando had already first changed back in cuba, having to leave his pack and family because there was no way for them to leave.  All of the family he picked out which was a motley sort, had first changed as well or showed tells of being blooded.  A local cigar owner, Roy Shapiro, took a chance on Armando.  He hired the youth at his store Viva Cigar Lounge.  Soon he noticed Armandoâs abilities with rolling cigars by hand.

Dr. Fairchild was known for traveling the world in search of useful plants, but he was also an educator and a renowned scientist. At the age of 22, he created the Section of Foreign Seed and Plant Introduction of the United States Department of Agriculture, and for the next 37 years, he traveled the world in search of plants of potential use to the American people.  In 1898, David Fairchild establishes the USDA Plant Introduction Garden in Florida.  He continued to travel and explore, what the history books leave out is that David Fairchild was a Ithaeur Bone Shadow.  He and his pack traveled not only studying the real world but also the hisil.  %0a%3c Dr. Fairchild retired to Miami in 1935 and joined a group of passionate plant collectors and horticulturists who also happened to be his packmates, including retired accountant Col. Robert H. Montgomery (1872-1953), environmentalist Marjory Stoneman Douglas, County Commissioner Charles Crandon and landscape architect William Lyman Phillips. This core group worked tirelessly to bring the idea of a one of a kind botanic garden to life, and in 1938, Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden opened its 83 acres to the public for the first time.. Col. Montgomery, who founded the Garden, named it to honor his friend. Many plants still growing in the Garden were collected by Dr. Fairchild, including a giant African baobab tree by the Gate House. In 1940, Dr. Fairchild embarked on the Garden's first official collecting expedition, sailing from the Philippines to the Indonesian archipelago on a special oceangoing Chinese junk called the Cheng Ho. The voyage provided many of the Garden's early botanical specimens before the outbreak of World War II forced the explorers to return home.%0a%3c %0a%3c Dr Fairchild married Marian Hubbard Bell, the pair of them had two children, A son Graham Fairchild, and daughter Nancy Fairchild.  The Fairchild family has long roots in New England, United States. They descend from Thomas Fairchild who came from England in 1639 and settled in Stratford, Connecticut, a part of the fledgling New Haven Colony.

The Hayes family and other Thrice-Born will be the first to offer assistance to any pack that asks for their help as long is it does not harm another Uratha.

He was a Irraka belonging to the Iron Masters.  Sewell, working for Henry Flagler, served as foreman and superintendent for the Florida East Coast Railway during the construction of the line from Jacksonville to Miami and later joined the hotel construction department. After helping to construct The Royal Poinciana Hotel and The Breakers Hotel at Palm Beach, Sewell moved to Miami in 1896 to work on the Royal Palm Hotel. While working on the hotel, Sewell stumbled upon the burial grounds of the Tequesta Native-Americans. Sewell gave away some of the skulls as souvenirs, and ordered African-American laborers to move the remaining bones and bury them in a hole, he did this to see if he could provoke some of the local Native American Spirits into showing themselves. . Sewell remained in the employ of the Florida East Coast Railway until 1899, when he left to concentrate his efforts on the mercantile establishment jointly owned with this brother. He was Mayor of the City of Miami from 1903 to 1907.%0a%3c %0a%3c After serving in local politics, Sewell began the construction of his house in 1912. Built on the highest point in the city, the house was named Halissee Hall from the Seminole word meaning "New Moon." He married a young Elodoth named Mary Jones.  Between them having six children. Four made it to adulthood, two of whom first changed to follow in their parents footsteps.%0a%3c %0a%3c Sewell wrote a self-published autobiography entitled John Sewell's Memoirs and History of Miami, Florida. It included an appendix describing his witnessing the attempted assassination of president-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933. The book is valuable as a primary source of information on pioneer days in Miami.%0a%3c %0a%3c He is buried in the Miami City Cemetery.%0a%3c %0a%3c Everest George "E. G." Sewell ( September 17, 1874 â April 2, 1940) was a former Mayor of Miami.%0a%3c %0a%3c E. G. and his brother, John Sewell moved to Miami on March 3, 1896 and opened the first store north of the Miami River on March 26, 1896. In February 1916, he was elected as president of Miami Chamber of Commerce and was re-elected every year until 1925 (except for 1919). He was elected as Mayor of Miami in 1927 (until 1929), 1933 (until 1935), 1939 (in recall election for 2 months), and lastly 1939 (until his death in 1940).  EG never changed, but he did use his power as mayor to cover up incidents from the shadow. %0a%3c %0a%3c EG married a young woman named Lucinda Blackwell who worked in his first store, She was an Iron Master Elodoth.  She was with him every step of the way on his political career, helping him and acting as the perfect Mayor's wife.  She gave him a total of seven children, but only three made it to adulthood.  Only one of the children, a young man named George, changed under the full moon.  Picking to join the Hunters in Darkness. %0a%3c He died two days after suffering a heart attack on April 2, 1940 at Jackson Memorial Hospital. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a city of Miami nature park named after him: E. G. Sewell Park located at 1801 NW South River Drive.%0a%3c %0a%3c From the two brothers, we have the Sewell family.  The Sewell familyâs house was one of Miamiâs most prominent homes. Halissee Hall was acquired by the University of Miami in 1932 and, over the years, the University of Miami School of Medicine and Jackson Memorial Hospital grew up around the former estate. In 1997, the Medical Faculty Association took the initiative to undertake a complete restoration of this National Historic Register structure. When completed, Halissee will be home to the School of Medicineâs Faculty Club and will host receptions, conferences and lectures â once again, entertaining men and women vital to the growth of Miami and South Florida.%0a%3c It is known among the family, that there is a series of tunnels under the University of Miami.  That allow the family access to their home on campus.  Some say that both brothers had a hand in building it, as a way to move around in emergencies.

It makes sense that the family would move out to the Western world to make their name bigger. They came overseas ten years before the War of the Four and actively fought against the vampires and the mages. They had a huge advantage being hidden in Portlandï¿½s Chinatown, knowing how the Shanghai Tunnels of the city worked. %0a> %0a> The family is known for its connections to the Triad and underground dealings. They are the enforcers and bodyguards for the higher leaders in the world, but some do manage upper-level members once in awhile.%0a> %0a> It wasnï¿½t until the Awakening of one of the main familyï¿½s sons happened. At first, they hid him because the mages would steal their son away from them and they would have to fight against him. He was socially inept due to his hiding, but when he came out of hiding and declared he was a mage, the Forsaken were not sure what to do with him since he was apart of their family. Some wanted him dead, others exiled. The connection and a few other events are what caused the Supernatural Alliance to form to the dismay of many.%0a> %0a> Over time though, the Zhang family became pro-UN as their Markus became a head of the Mysterium over time, changing their thoughts towards the pesky mages. Not every member feels comfortable with the Alliance but they accept it and have access to starting to become a family that doesnï¿½t focus on war, but rather knowledge, following Markusï¿½ example.%0a> %0a> The head of the family, Zhang Fan is only blooded, but the Chinese family accepts the oldest living member as the head, rather than the strongest. Fan never First changed and was protected during the war of the four where many of the families Forsaken had died. Slowly, the 95%25 wolf-blooded family had more first changes and have restored a formidable amount of Uratha up to about 10%25 Uratha at the current day. Markus is currently the mages spokesperson for the family and to this day, the only member of the family that has Awakened. %0a> %0a> The familyï¿½s Uratha at first were about seventy-five percent Blood Talons. While this has changed over the last three decades, with more Storm Lords and Iron Masters taking place in the family, the Blood Talons are still most of the chosen Tribe of the family.

Immigration usually entails violation of ancestral ties and parental obligations. Dealing in their youths with convulsive change, thrown back on their own devices to create a productive existence, ripped untimely from the womb of a settled life, immigrants everywhere suffer the guilts of disconnection from their homes and families and ally easily with the forces of the future against the claims of the past. Shaped by a fractured or betrayed conservatism, however, the immigrant's most revolutionary creations usually reverberate with remembered values. In forging a new world, he continually restores the old.%0a%3c %0a%3c In the history of the United States, each new flood of immigrants has enacted this essential drama of abandonment and rebuilding. But in recent years, no group has played it out with the energy and resourcefulness of the Cubans who fled Castro's Cuba in rage and fear and settled first in Miami, Florida.%0a%3c %0a%3c The city did not seem ready for them. For the economy of central Miami, 1961 was a grim year. In the inner-city area around the Tamiami Trail, more than 1,000 homes, with Federal Housing Administration mortgages, had been vacated, and many were vandalized for their copper pipe and electrical fixtures. Local shops gasped for customers and went broke; 40-year-old Burdine's, the chief downtown department store, was languishing helplessly as its clientele moved toward the suburbs. Even Miami Beach, the supreme American resort across the Bay of Biscayne, was slipping perceptibly past its prime, as wealthy northern tourists increasingly passed it by for mellower island shores to the south.%0a%3c %0a%3c To many observers, the arrival of the Cubans seemed a deadly blow to the city's hope for recovery. Some 200,000 had already fled Castro's burgeoning dictatorship, and more arrived daily. Castro had proclaimed a new law of potestas patria under which he was abolishing Catholic schools, establishing centers for communist indoctrination, incarcerating dissidents, and commandeering lawyers and other white-collar people for labor in the sugar fields. Refugees flocked the Miami airport, in painful confusion; then clustered five or more to a room in Miami bungalows and apartments, looking for jobs, nonexistent in the struggling Dade County economy, and confidently awaiting deliveranceâand vicarious vengeanceâthrough a brutal charge of US Marines onto the beaches of Cuba, ordered by America's macho new president, John F. Kennedy.%0a%3c %0a%3c Some 13,000 of the immigrants came as unaccompanied children, landing in Miami without kin, without English, and many with only a vague connection in the United States. They had been packed off by desperate parents and left to be processed in refugee camps and then passed on to orphanages and foster homes. Many of the immigrants of all ages were channeled first to other communities, but most of them gravitated back to southern Florida, the area closest to their prior home and most acculturated with Cubans.%0a%3c %0a%3c All statistical projections were dismal. Experts foresaw a prolonged siege of medical crises, economic stresses, and ethnic frictions; a teeming burden of "social disorders," needs for housing, welfare, and simple hygieneâan impossible load for the already afflicted social services of the city. Here in one economically stagnant urban area, over a period of just two years, thronged some 200,000 penurious immigrantsâmore than the total of black unemployed youths in all of America's urban areas at the time, concentrated in the hard core of one central city. It was an influx about one-fifth the size of the entire Dade County population in 1960, an inundation more rapid and overwhelming than any previous migration to one American city.%0a%3c %0a%3c Few of the arrivals spoke English, and virtually none had arranged for jobs or housing. Many had been reasonably well educated and well employed in Cuba, but their experience and credentials were often irrelevant in the United States. Doctors, architects, and lawyers escaped the sugar fields only to work as busboys, bootblacks, and parking-lot attendants. Nearly 60 percent of the exiles had been common laborers even in Cuba, and all had lost most of what they had accumulated at home. From the press coverage and political comment of the day, it is difficult to find any observers who saw this human flood as anything but a tribulation for southern Florida or a problem to be solved by saviors at the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and the Immigration and Naturalization Serviceâor the US Marines.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Cubans' saviors, however, were already at hand: they would be saved by themselvesânot chiefly by a trickle-down of grants from the government, but by the upsurge of their own productive efforts. They would be saved by people like JosÃ© Palmero, penniless, having invested his last dollars in some second hand records to peddle door to door; by Armando Codina, then a frightened, gangly youth, with just two words of English, hamburger and Coke, assigned to a refugee camp.%0a%3c %0a%3c Armando Cordina settled in among the others in what would soon be called Little Havana.  Armando himself, fled for the same reason many of the others did.  While most of them had what folks would consider proper jobs, back in Cuba, Armandoâs skill set lay in the more âgreyâ area.  He was however, very charismatic.  He started collecting other cuban orphans.  He still had connections back with his âfamilyâ back home.   Armando set up himself and his new family, they started first with weed in small batches and some cocaine and cigars.  Then expanded to narcotics as well.  Armando pressed upon the family that they find legitimate cover jobs to explain where their money came from.  Most of them being teenagers, and young adults did simple jobs, cleaning up local businesses, or running errands and packages.  A few worked as day laborers, or looking over children.  %0a%3c %0a%3c Armando had already first changed back in cuba, having to leave his pack and family because there was no way for them to leave.  All of the family he picked out which was a motley sort, had first changed as well or showed tells of being blooded.  A local cigar owner, Roy Shapiro, took a chance on Armando.  He hired the youth at his store Viva Cigar Lounge.  Soon he noticed Armandoâs abilities with rolling cigars by hand.  He also made money off the counterfeit Cuban cigars that he and his friends rolled.  After the embargo ban, cuban cigars became a thing of high demand.%0a%3c %0a%3c Armando worked three jobs, running the family the cigar store and the side business that fueled everything else.  He was able to save his cash, and rented an apartment building for everyone to have their own space.  When Roy picked to âretiredâ to palm springs, he sold the store to Armando.  It showed a great amount of trust on Royâs part.  Leaving the store to his young employee.  %0a%3c %0a%3c With the store now in the hands of the Cordina Family, they flourished.  Under the table, they sold cubans.  They had a steady supply that came in around the trade embargo,  Armando taught his family how to take some of the actual Cubans, cutting them open and mixing them with real cigars and then rerolling and relabeling them to near perfection.  Doubling their product to sell and tripling their profits.  On the outside, the public face, Armando Cordina and his family seemed like a typical success story.  They had come here from Cuba with nothing, and with the successful business plan, they opened two more Viva Cigar stores, both in prominent hotels in the area, both of them owned by the Sewell family.  %0a%3c In the 80âs when another flood of Cubans came to Miami, their ranks swelled as many of those whoâd come over in the 60âs asked their families to join them.  Bringing in more and more connections.  Armando helped send many of the children born in Miami to good schools and on to college.  Using the grey money to fund it.  In return he got well educated young uratha and blooded to help protect the family.  Keeping it in house  With their help he kept it up the drug running, and was able to bring in new shipment lines from Cuba down into Miami.    %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!%25center%25Other family names: Palmero, Oyarzun, Valls%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!%25center%25Head of the Family \\%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25'''NPC'''  \\%0a%3c %25center%25''Moon Tribe'' \\%0a%3c %25center%25'''Bio''':  Info%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Rest of the Family%0a%3c *'''NPC'''%0a%3c **''Tribe & Moon''%0a%3c *'''NPC'''%0a%3c **''Tribe & Moon''%0a%3c *'''NPC '''%0a%3c **''Tribe & Moon''%0a%3c *'''NPC'''%0a%3c **''Tribe & Moon''%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!'''Property''' %0a---%0a> !!!!%25center%25''The Dï¿½ambrosio Family'' %0a> %25center%25'''(Embassy Opposition)'''%0a> %0a> The Dï¿½Ambrosio family came over from Italy around the same time as the Zhang family. Instead of choosing to be a part of the criminal underworld they first chose to be police officers and city leaders. This didnï¿½t change during the War of the Four, but it put them in a position to enforce police brutality against other supernaturals and try to pass laws to create curfews to restrict vampire movement. The were the biggest threat for the other factions during this war. Killing a leader or a Captain of the police Force would have brought more focus to the city than any supernatural wanted.%0a> %0a> Then the first wave cameï¿½ the Hunters attacked all four factions which brought the alliance about. Laws that were created were overturned. Several members of the police were forced into retirement, including a dozen members of the family. Even one of the lawmakers of the city had to step down during this time. The family was broken in a year's time.%0a> %0a> They are against the alliance, the same Alliance that broke the family. Even when the UN offers help, they refuse. Pride is a huge factor, but there is another reason. The family believes the Shadow has become abstract and peculiar. Light Spirits having Darkness Influence and Tree Spirits have Fire based Numina. The Dï¿½Ambrosioï¿½s believe this was caused by the Supernatural alliance as the spirits have gotten more confusing with how they work in recent years. They want to bring the Shadow back to its original state with Water Spirits influencing water, not electricity.%0a> %0a> Members of the family that First change have recently become more focused on being Bone Shadows as they want to give Spirits their original forms back to them.

In fact, they have had trouble with getting important jobs in the city. When the richest family member brings in 40K a year, you know they have fallen on hard times.

Places of spiritual power  that werewolves banded together and protected.  In Werewolf the Forsaken there  are no Caerns. Each pack of werewolves has their own territory usually claimed around a locus.. And no larger than a city block or two.More powerful packs might have larger territory.  Problem arise when two pack but heads over territory. This usually solved by the two packs themselves usually violently, and as long as it doesnt spill out enough to let the humans see what is going on packs are left to sort things out themselves. %0a> %0a> While a protectorate - a group of packs that hold territory over a large amount of land ( usually a city)  Might have an Alpha pack. It is not the Alpha packs responsibility to police all the other packs. They have their own territory to protect. Their own prey to hunt. %0a> %0a> Some packs might want to meet and talk things out. Information might need to be shared, stories told about the things packs have been doing, or things that threaten the protectorate,, and Urratha are social creatures at heart. This is where the concept to a Tur comes from. It is a Neutral area.  Not claimed by any pack. It is not itself a loci. %0a> %0a> Turs are usually places in locations far from where activity might be noticed by the human population, out of the way corners of public parks surrounded by fences.

Other spirits, those that hate the Forsaken for their role in the death of ''Urfarah'', judge each Pure based on the form of the Oath that he took.  The Oath is a silver chain binding the monster. Yet it also drives those it binds to be better than they are. Mother Luna watches over her children still, and they know it through the presence of Lunes, the mad moon spirits. Lunes judge the Oath, exalting its champions and condemning its transgressors.

It is both specific and ambiguous, which of course only adds to the confusion. Most agree the law makes it taboo to kill anyone with the blood of the Wolf except at great need. Many Uratha think of Wolf-Blooded and human pack members as part of the People, and thus their lives are equally sacred.  Nearly as many interpretations of this law exist as there are packs in the world. Open challenges of dominance resulting in accidental death might be considered acceptable to some, while murder of an unaware victim is a heinous crime. Lunes offer little help interpreting the law, their words every bit as contradictory as clashing Forsaken beliefs. Most werewolves assume that beating another werewolf is acceptable within the Oath. Slaying a defeated foe is murder. Killing when unnecessary ï¿½ whether prey or fellow werewolf ï¿½ is a sin, especially when the victim is one of your own kind. Elodoth argue with their packs and with one another about whether or not the law includes the Pure Tribes. Some Pure seem to believe that killing Forsaken is taboo, although torture doesnï¿½t violate the law. Likewise, some Forsaken refuse to kill the Pure except when the Pure would murder them, and even then sing their lament to wolf and moon.%0a---%0a> *A subject of many tribal debates and heated blood feuds, this tenet says that murdering other Uratha is a grave sin. It is both specific and ambiguous, which of course only adds to the confusion. Most agree the law makes it taboo to kill anyone with the blood of the Wolf except at great need.

Many humans and spirits feign distaste at the idea, but they, too, abide by hierarchies. The world simply wonï¿½t allow equality for everyone, and the Forsaken know it. If the prey is stronger than the pack, the pack must bring it to its level. If one pack is stronger than another, the stronger will wins out. It is the law of the wild. Younger werewolves with heads full of pride rebuke the authority of the elders. They feel the elders enforce this law, or perhaps made it up entirely, simply to wield power. In turn, the elders bear their scars, sing of their bloody glories, and take what they feel is their due. Wise elders know that the second half of the clause demands they show respect for pups and young hunters, and afford their less experienced kin that respect. Even the old and strong can have their throats torn out by angry pups. Attitudes toward this law vary within protectorates. In some, elders are given proper deference both for their ability as hunters and their wisdom as Forsaken. Some grow cruel or brutal. They fall out of balance and meet their ends at the claws of the oppressed. Some keep young werewolves in line when even the Oath canï¿½t always guide them. All respect the Firstborn and the ways that the Forsaken have followed since prehistory. If wise elders know that they should respect the young hunters, then wise pups know to respect the scarred veterans for their knowledge and prowess.%0a---%0a> *Uratha are intimately familiar with dominance and submission.

Werewolves fully know the dangers of imbalance. Their ability to hunt suffers. Their territories fall into decline. They grow weak, as did Urfarahin his final days, and soon meet their ends. Wisdom teaches that werewolves should respect their prey. Strong prey shapes strong predators, and vice versa. It is a precarious balance. A pack that kills callously gains enemies among spirits who see them as cruel barbarians. Indifference to the deaths of animals and spirits leads to losing respect for the hunt itself. A true predator kills out of necessity, not mere desire. Respect your prey, and it in turn respects your place as its predator. Spirits lash out at needlessly vicious werewolves, but those who properly respect the hunt earn the Shadowï¿½s begrudging respect as a necessary part of the natural order. Even the most selfish spirits can recognize the honor and savage nobility of the Uratha.  Some Uratha take this a step further. When one of these werewolves kills a deer, she understands that the animal has given its life that hers can continue. She respects the weight of the act. For most, killing is simply about necessity. Creatures like the Hosts and Claimed must be killed before they kill werewolves in turn. Respecting your prey means respecting the need for werewolves to hunt it. These creatures are deadly monsters in their own right.  Even humans are not exempt from Uratha predation, something which younger werewolves often have difficulty grasping. Humans can be prey, and in many cases must be, though the Oath forbids consumption of human flesh. Older werewolves, and those who quickly take to their roles as the ultimate predators, feel no more remorse for killing humans than they do for any other creature. Merciful werewolves might warn humans off first through various terrifying means. Just as many kill them as readily as they would their next meal.%0a---%0a> ***Humans long ago abandoned this law and suffer for it. Werewolves fully know the dangers of imbalance.

It is a surrender of honor and control, and no meat is sweeter upon the tongue of a hungry werewolf. The rush of power is too much, though. To a werewolf, eating her own kind, or her close kin, is a grave temptation that also drags her closer to the spirit than the flesh.  Forsaken lorekeepers have long wondered at the truth of the matter. This clause is one of the oldest and certainly the clearest. Some Uratha then wonder if the temptation has always existed, deliberately left by the mad moon-goddess or born in Father Wolfï¿½s death at the claws and teeth of his own progeny. Perhaps it is an eternal reminder of that grave act. Whatever its origin, it remains a temptation and a threat to a werewolfï¿½s soul. In the throes of Kuruth, even the most disciplined Uratha might devour her kill and remember the taste through the mists of Rage. No werewolf is safe from this temptation, even those who have never tasted the power of the sweetest meats.%0a---%0a> *The act provides power and pleasure, a rush of Essence and a perverse satisfaction of basest urges.

A large-scale war between humans and werewolves would end badly for the werewolves. Even if the Uratha won a protracted war against their human kin, the results would devastate the world. Cunning werewolves stick to the shadows, hunting at night or across the Gauntlet. While itï¿½s easy to dismiss ï¿½Bigfoot sightingsï¿½ and isolated animal attacks, danger follows increased scrutiny.

Places of spiritual power  that werewolves banded together and protected.  In Werewolf the Forsaken there  are no Caerns. Each pack of werewolves has their own territory usually claimed around a locus.. And no larger than a city block or two.More powerful packs might have larger territory.  Problem arise when two pack but heads over territory. This usually solved by the two packs themselves usually violently, and as long as it doesn&#2013266066;t spill out enough to let the humans see what is going on packs are left to sort things out themselves. %0a%3c %0a%3c While a protectorate - a group of packs that hold territory over a large amount of land ( usually a city)  Might have an Alpha pack. It is not the Alpha packs responsibility to police all the other packs. They have their own territory to protect. Their own prey to hunt. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some packs might want to meet and talk things out. Information might need to be shared, stories told about the things packs have been doing, or things that threaten the protectorate,, and Urratha are social creatures at heart. This is where the concept to a Tur comes from. It is a Neutral area.  Not claimed by any pack. It is not itself a loci. %0a%3c %0a%3c Turs are usually places in locations far from where activity might be noticed by the human population, out of the way corners of public parks surrounded by fences. The  top of mountains that are closed for most of the year because of snow. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Uratha of the City of Portland have two known TURs. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''Forest Park Tur''%0a%3c %0a%3c The first, and best known Tur is in Forest park Tur which is found by  going off the trails of the park. Those who are werewolves, wolfblood or part of a pack will be able to find the marks and seals that lead them to the Tur%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''Mount Hood Tur''%0a%3c %0a%3c  The second is the mount Hood Tur which is located at the Bagby Hot springs.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Bagby Hot Springs are natural hot springs located in the Mount Hood National Forest about 67 miles (108 km) southeast of Portland, Oregon, United States and about 41 miles (66 km) east of Salem, Oregon. The springs are within the Cascade Mountains in a heavily forested area at elevation 2280 ft (695 m).[1] The springs are just outside the boundary of Bull of the Woods Wilderness area.. The Springs have been Privately owned  since the early 1990&#2013266066;s  The family that owns the spring are comprised of Wolf blooded, of all different tribes who banded together to buy and protect the land. %0a%3c %0a

The Hayes family and other Thrice-Born will be the first to offer assistance to any pack that asks for their help as long is it does not harm another Uratha.

It makes sense that the family would move out to the Western world to make their name bigger. They came overseas ten years before the War of the Four and actively fought against the vampires and the mages. They had a huge advantage being hidden in Portlands Chinatown, knowing how the Shanghai Tunnels of the city worked. %0a%3c %0a%3c The family is known for its connections to the Triad and underground dealings. They are the enforcers and bodyguards for the higher leaders in the world, but some do manage upper-level members once in awhile.%0a%3c %0a%3c It wasnt until the Awakening of one of the main familys sons happened. At first, they hid him because the mages would steal their son away from them and they would have to fight against him. He was socially inept due to his hiding, but when he came out of hiding and declared he was a mage, the Forsaken were not sure what to do with him since he was apart of their family. Some wanted him dead, others exiled. The connection and a few other events are what caused the Supernatural Alliance to form to the dismay of many.%0a%3c %0a%3c Over time though, the Zhang family became pro-UN as their Markus became a head of the Mysterium over time, changing their thoughts towards the pesky mages. Not every member feels comfortable with the Alliance but they accept it and have access to starting to become a family that doesnt focus on war, but rather knowledge, following Markus example.%0a%3c %0a%3c The head of the family, Zhang Fan is only blooded, but the Chinese family accepts the oldest living member as the head, rather than the strongest. Fan never First changed and was protected during the war of the four where many of the families Forsaken had died. Slowly, the 95%25 wolf-blooded family had more first changes and have restored a formidable amount of Uratha up to about 10%25 Uratha at the current day. Markus is currently the mages spokesperson for the family and to this day, the only member of the family that has Awakened. %0a%3c %0a%3c The familys Uratha at first were about seventy-five percent Blood Talons. While this has changed over the last three decades, with more Storm Lords and Iron Masters taking place in the family, the Blood Talons are still most of the chosen Tribe of the family. Still, the Hunters in Darkness and Bone Shadows, even Ghost Wolves, have their place in the family.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25Head of Family \\%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25'''Zhang Fan''' (84) \\%0a%3c %25center%25''Wolf-blooded'' \\%0a%3c %25center%25'''Personality''': Resilient, Stern, Strict, super happy when drunk \\%0a%3c %25center%25'''Story Hooks''': Fan definitely has connections to the Triad and is seen as an important member in the Triad. He has more pull in the criminal sphere than most in the city due to sixty years in the city.%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''The Dambrosio Family'' %0a%3c %25center%25'''(Embassy Opposition)'''%0a%3c %0a%3c The DAmbrosio family came over from Italy around the same time as the Zhang family. Instead of choosing to be a part of the criminal underworld they first chose to be police officers and city leaders. This didnt change during the War of the Four, but it put them in a position to enforce police brutality against other supernaturals and try to pass laws to create curfews to restrict vampire movement. The were the biggest threat for the other factions during this war. Killing a leader or a Captain of the police Force would have brought more focus to the city than any supernatural wanted.%0a%3c %0a%3c Then the first wave came the Hunters attacked all four factions which brought the alliance about. Laws that were created were overturned. Several members of the police were forced into retirement, including a dozen members of the family. Even one of the lawmakers of the city had to step down during this time. The family was broken in a year's time.%0a%3c %0a%3c They are against the alliance, the same Alliance that broke the family. Even when the UN offers help, they refuse. Pride is a huge factor, but there is another reason. The family believes the Shadow has become abstract and peculiar. Light Spirits having Darkness Influence and Tree Spirits have Fire based Numina. The DAmbrosios believe this was caused by the Supernatural alliance as the spirits have gotten more confusing with how they work in recent years. They want to bring the Shadow back to its original state with Water Spirits influencing water, not electricity.%0a%3c %0a%3c Members of the family that First change have recently become more focused on being Bone Shadows as they want to give Spirits their original forms back to them. This has taken over the majority being Storm Lords and Iron Masters in recent years, but both are still prevalent.%0a%3c %0a%3c The family no longer holds major political positions or important city jobs. In fact, they have had trouble with getting important jobs in the city. When the richest family member brings in 40K a year, you know they have fallen on hard times. If they asked for help, this would be the case, but family pride is too important. The DAmbrosios want to make a name for themselves again, but not with a cost so steep as to accept help from the UN.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25Head of Family%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25'''Melody Annette DAmbrosio -MAD-''' (38) \\%0a%3c %25center%25''Rahu Bone Shadow'' \\%0a%3c %25center%25'''Personality''': Bitchy, Vindictive, Catty \\%0a%3c %25center%25'''Story Hook''': Thankfully she focuses on the spirits more than the familys fall from grace. She hunts the dangerous spirits and tries to remake the abstracts and broken spirits whole again. Underneath that bitch of a shell, there is a soft spot for those who are broken.%0a

They hunt to survive. They feel the rush of blood in their veins and from the open wounds of their prey. Death intertwines with life, and fury with joy. Bound not by human authority or morality, they are monsters who hunt monsters. Without a guiding purpose, many would descend into atavistic madness. All Forsaken have a purpose, however: the Oath of the Moon, sworn to their moon-god/dess in the name of their dead Father.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Oath binds Uratha to a code of savage harmony. It defines Siskur-Dah, the legacy of Urfarah. It helps Luna&#2013266066;s shapeshifting brood find its place in a world of animistic duality. Above all, the Oath is a weapon against degeneration into a mindless beast. By the Oath are Forsaken lifted above half-blind humans and mere wolves and spirits. Through it they gain strength, a creed, and an outlet through which to express their dedication. Even the Pure swear a version of the Oath, though each tribe has its own variations, and none of the Anshegawould ever swear it to Luna. Other spirits, those that hate the Forsaken for their role in the death of Urfarah, judge each Pure based on the form of the Oath that he took.  The Oath is a silver chain binding the monster. Yet it also drives those it binds to be better than they are. Mother Luna watches over her children still, and they know it through the presence of Lunes, the mad moon spirits. Lunes judge the Oath, exalting its champions and condemning its transgressors. Each of the Lunes is as bipolar as its mother, and while one might decry a werewolf for not upholding the Oath strongly enough, it might also barely react when she achieves a great success. No one said adhering to a creed of primeval hunters and capricious spirits would ever be easy.%0a%3c %0a%3c Not all punishments come from the Lunes. Werewolves who reject the Oath become lost in the hunt without guidance or support from the Firstborn. Some reject the Oath out of wickedness, and so become little more than cunning beasts who sometimes wear human skin. Ignoring the Oath is a sure way to lose one&#2013266066;s grip on the things that make the Uratha who, rather than what, they are. Without balance, werewolves can become trapped in one form or even one world. In time, they forget even what they once were, becoming as single-minded and inflexible as spirits.%0a%3c %0a%3c Several tenets comprise the Oath. Each tribe (indeed, each pack) places greater importance on some of the laws than it does the others. The added significance is in regard to tribe&#2013266066;s favored prey and its view of a proper world. Some werewolves pay only lip service to one tenet. The more devout take every law as sacred. In the end, not even her packmates can determine how a werewolf approaches the Oath; it is a decision she must make for herself.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''Urum Da Takus'''%0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''The Wolf Must Hunt''%0a%3c *No werewolf can transgress against this tenet, for it is the beating heart of his existence. The People hunt. They revere Siskur-Dahas their most holy purpose. To them, it is not just a way of life; the hunt is life. It is Father Wolf&#2013266066;s greatest legacy.  Only werewolves can hunt like Urfarahonce did. Every pack has its own rituals of the hunt, as does every Ghost Wolf. Like any religious law, this tenet is a point of contention among rivals and enemies. A pack&#2013266066;s solemn duty is to hunt, whether things of flesh or spirit or both. Failure to do so causes other packs to doubt the pack&#2013266066;s commitment, using it as an excuse (real or feigned) to move on its territory. Bloody clashes under the moon usually follow, threatening the sanctity of the Oath&#2013266066;s next most important clause.%0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''Imru Nu Fir Imru'''%0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''The People Do Not Murder The People''%0a%3c *A subject of many tribal debates and heated blood feuds, this tenet says that murdering other Uratha is a grave sin. It is both specific and ambiguous, which of course only adds to the confusion. Most agree the law makes it taboo to kill anyone with the blood of the Wolf except at great need. Many Uratha think of Wolf-Blooded and human pack members as part of the People, and thus their lives are equally sacred.  Nearly as many interpretations of this law exist as there are packs in the world. Open challenges of dominance resulting in accidental death might be considered acceptable to some, while murder of an unaware victim is a heinous crime. Lunes offer little help interpreting the law, their words every bit as contradictory as clashing Forsaken beliefs. Most werewolves assume that beating another werewolf is acceptable within the Oath. Slaying a defeated foe is murder. Killing when unnecessary  whether prey or fellow werewolf  is a sin, especially when the victim is one of your own kind. Elodoth argue with their packs and with one another about whether or not the law includes the Pure Tribes. Some Pure seem to believe that killing Forsaken is taboo, although torture doesnt violate the law. Likewise, some Forsaken refuse to kill the Pure except when the Pure would murder them, and even then sing their lament to wolf and moon.%0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''Sih Sehe Mak; Mak Ne Sih'''%0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''The Low Honor The High; The High Respect The Low''%0a%3c *Uratha are intimately familiar with dominance and submission. Many humans and spirits feign distaste at the idea, but they, too, abide by hierarchies. The world simply wont allow equality for everyone, and the Forsaken know it. If the prey is stronger than the pack, the pack must bring it to its level. If one pack is stronger than another, the stronger will wins out. It is the law of the wild. Younger werewolves with heads full of pride rebuke the authority of the elders. They feel the elders enforce this law, or perhaps made it up entirely, simply to wield power. In turn, the elders bear their scars, sing of their bloody glories, and take what they feel is their due. Wise elders know that the second half of the clause demands they show respect for pups and young hunters, and afford their less experienced kin that respect. Even the old and strong can have their throats torn out by angry pups. Attitudes toward this law vary within protectorates. In some, elders are given proper deference both for their ability as hunters and their wisdom as Forsaken. Some grow cruel or brutal. They fall out of balance and meet their ends at the claws of the oppressed. Some keep young werewolves in line when even the Oath cant always guide them. All respect the Firstborn and the ways that the Forsaken have followed since prehistory. If wise elders know that they should respect the young hunters, then wise pups know to respect the scarred veterans for their knowledge and prowess.%0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''Ni Daha'''%0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''Respect You Prey''%0a%3c ***Humans long ago abandoned this law and suffer for it. Werewolves fully know the dangers of imbalance. Their ability to hunt suffers. Their territories fall into decline. They grow weak, as did Urfarahin his final days, and soon meet their ends. Wisdom teaches that werewolves should respect their prey. Strong prey shapes strong predators, and vice versa. It is a precarious balance. A pack that kills callously gains enemies among spirits who see them as cruel barbarians. Indifference to the deaths of animals and spirits leads to losing respect for the hunt itself. A true predator kills out of necessity, not mere desire. Respect your prey, and it in turn respects your place as its predator. Spirits lash out at needlessly vicious werewolves, but those who properly respect the hunt earn the Shadows begrudging respect as a necessary part of the natural order. Even the most selfish spirits can recognize the honor and savage nobility of the Uratha.  Some Uratha take this a step further. When one of these werewolves kills a deer, she understands that the animal has given its life that hers can continue. She respects the weight of the act. For most, killing is simply about necessity. Creatures like the Hosts and Claimed must be killed before they kill werewolves in turn. Respecting your prey means respecting the need for werewolves to hunt it. These creatures are deadly monsters in their own right.  Even humans are not exempt from Uratha predation, something which younger werewolves often have difficulty grasping. Humans can be prey, and in many cases must be, though the Oath forbids consumption of human flesh. Older werewolves, and those who quickly take to their roles as the ultimate predators, feel no more remorse for killing humans than they do for any other creature. Merciful werewolves might warn humans off first through various terrifying means. Just as many kill them as readily as they would their next meal.%0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''Nu Hu Uzuz Eren'''%0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''Do Not Eat The Flesh Of Man Or Wolf''%0a%3c *The act provides power and pleasure, a rush of Essence and a perverse satisfaction of basest urges. It is a surrender of honor and control, and no meat is sweeter upon the tongue of a hungry werewolf. The rush of power is too much, though. To a werewolf, eating her own kind, or her close kin, is a grave temptation that also drags her closer to the spirit than the flesh.  Forsaken lorekeepers have long wondered at the truth of the matter. This clause is one of the oldest and certainly the clearest. Some Uratha then wonder if the temptation has always existed, deliberately left by the mad moon-goddess or born in Father Wolfs death at the claws and teeth of his own progeny. Perhaps it is an eternal reminder of that grave act. Whatever its origin, it remains a temptation and a threat to a werewolfs soul. In the throes of Kuruth, even the most disciplined Uratha might devour her kill and remember the taste through the mists of Rage. No werewolf is safe from this temptation, even those who have never tasted the power of the sweetest meats.%0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''Nu Bath Githul'''%0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''The Herd Must Not Know''%0a%3c *Werewolves are mightier than any human, but not invincible. Angry, determined humans threaten even a pack. %0a%3c Guns and bombs quickly even up the score, and those few hunters capable of standing against the Uratha know some of their weaknesses. Younger werewolves laugh at the thought, thinking themselves immortal. This law protects against that headstrong thinking; it was born of a need to protect werewolves, not humans. A large-scale war between humans and werewolves would end badly for the werewolves. Even if the Uratha won a protracted war against their human kin, the results would devastate the world. Cunning werewolves stick to the shadows, hunting at night or across the Gauntlet. While its easy to dismiss Bigfoot sightings and isolated animal attacks, danger follows increased scrutiny. Werewolves already face enough challenges on the hunt.%0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''Uratha Safal Thil Lu'u'''%0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''The Uratha Shall Cleave To The Human''%0a%3c *Uratha mate among themselves and humans. They count humans among their packs, including the Wolf-Blooded. While they feel kinship with wolves, they crave socialization among humans. It grounds them, keeps them in touch with humanity, helps them maintain balance. Werewolves cannot forsake their human sides, lest they become remorseless monsters as selfish as spirits.%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !%25center%25'''Tribal Vows'''%0a%3c %0a%3c The Firstborn stand apart from other spirits as the great totems of Uratha tribes. First among the children of Urfarah, the Firstborn exemplify different aspects of Siskur-Dah. They are older siblings and guides to the Forsaken. Their patronage provides knowledge, and tools to hunt specific prey. In turn the tribes honor their totems with vows sworn to the Oath of the Moon in their names. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''Nu sum ghumur nu su ghid'''-Blood Talon%0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''Offer No Surrender You Would Not Accept''%0a%3c *The Blood Talons lead violent lives even for werewolves. They offer no quarter and seek none. Sworn on Fenris-Urs name is this oath: to offer no dishonorable surrender, and to accept none from their enemies. Blood Talons stand at the forefront of Uratha conflicts, where baring their throats means worse than death: It means ''weakness''.%0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''Su a sar-hith sa'''-Bone Shadow%0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''Pay Each Spirit in Kind''%0a%3c *Bone Shadows know that their path leads them through darkness, death, and terrible secrets. They stalk the Shadow, hunting the things that would hunt them. Sworn on ''Kamduis-Urs'' name is this oath: to pay each spirit with claw and ''gathra'', respect and rage. The Bone Shadows know what horrors await them if the Uratha grow weak.%0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''Nu mus halhala'''-Hunters in Darkness%0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''Let No Sacred Place in Your Territory Be Violated''%0a%3c *Hunters in Darkness hold their territories sacred in a way other tribes dont understand. It is the land in which the ''Meninna'' are supreme, the apex predators. Theirs is an ancient legacy borne proudly in their savage hearts. Sworn in ''Hikaon-Urs'' name is this oath: to never let friend or foe violate the Hunters territory unchallenged. The ''Meninna'' shape their ''mus-rahin'' service to the hunt; a violation of that ground is a violation of the Hunters very devotion.%0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''Kul kisura udmeda'''-Iron Master%0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''Honor Your Territory in All Things''%0a%3c *The Iron Masters know that change is the only constant. The world tomorrow might only resemble todays world in passing. The Iron Masters know that they must adapt to the world. They ever search for ways to master their realm. Sworn in ''Sagrim-Urs'' name is this oath: to remember that which defines a werewolf even in the face of change.%0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''Nu si gid namtar'''-Storm Lord%0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''Allow No One to Witness or to Tend Your Weakness''%0a%3c *Presence and power mean everything to the Storm Lords. They must stand as giants among their kin. To their enemies and to their rivals alike they show no weakness. To the ''Iminir'' themselves, they ''have'' no weakness. Storm Lords hold themselves to a higher standard, such that when anyone looks upon the face of the Uratha, they see a fearless wolf. Sworn in ''Skolis-Urs'' name is this oath: to remain unbreakable in service to the hunt.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> !%25center%25'''The Oaths of the Moon '''%0a> %0a> *test%0a> *test%0a> **test%0a> **test%0a> ***test%0a> *test%0a> %0a
