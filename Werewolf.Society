Luna blesses each of us with an auspice, a duty in Siskur-Dah. Through the blessing of our Moon mother we find our place in both the pack and world. Our dedication to Urfarah's duty so impressed many of his Firstborn children that they in turn created and blessed our tribes, each dedicated to hunting a specific prey. Beyond those groups, we have the pack monsters and humans that hunt as one to kill even the most powerful prey. \\%0a%0a\\%0aWe band together because we must. No werewolf should hunt alone. It goes against our nature, against our very being. We must be part of something beyond ourselves to succeed in the hunt. A pack can stalk from the shadows, run the prey to ground, then tear it limb from limb. A pack can share expertise, knowing the best way to hunt whether we stalk werewolf, spirits, shartha, humans or claimed. A pack can hold a hunting ground, giving us a territory where we have the advantage. A pack's human members provide links to the human world, giving us ties to the communities we grew up in but that we can no longer be a part of.%0a%0a!%25center%25%25werewolf%25'''The Tur'''%25%25%0aOne of the first locations the Forsaken took back was Frick Park and it was quickly named Tur. Ferox Mors maintains Tur and patrols it to keep it safe for the Uratha to use.%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25''Frick Park''%0aFrick Park is an ideal escape from the noise of the city. Known as Pittsburgh's woodland park for its extensive trails through steep valleys and wooded slopes.%0a%0aAlthough Henry Clay Frick bequeathed the original 151 acres to the city in 1919, the park did not open until 1927 after additional land had been acquired. Most recently, 106 acres were annexed to the park as part of the process that created the Summerset at Frick Park housing development and restored the Nine Mile Run stream valley. Today, Frick Park stretches from its northern borders in Point Breeze down to the Monongahela River.%0a%0aBirding enthusiasts love to visit Clayton Hill, where more than 100 species of birds have been recorded. Children flock to the famous Blue Slide Playground and learn about nature at the Frick Environmental Center. The park also features red clay tennis courts, baseball fields, and the only public lawn bowling green in Pennsylvania.%0a%0aThe Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy has completed extensive ecological restoration work in Frick Park since it's first capital project in 2000, the restoration of Reynolds Street gatehouse entrance. %0a%0aFrick Park is the largest park in Pittsburgh, and one of the first major locations the Forsaken were able to take as their own, thanks to an enterprising member of the Hunters in Darkness tribe who not only saw the use of the land, but also secured the area with various traps and alerts so they Pure couldn't regain the land. It is the main meeting grounds for the Forsaken in Pittsburgh, and where all the moots will be held.%0a%0aWith a variety of trails and activities, individuals who visit won't find themselves bored, while the Forsaken don't have to be found unless they wish to. %0a%0a'''Shadow:''' The Hisil of the Park is marred by the skirmishes and wars that have been fought there. Death and Carrion spirits fight for space with Healing spirits, but the latter is starting to gain ground with the aid of the Three Rivers Court starting to take more prominence in the area and the Court of Entropy and Corruption losing its hold and positions within the city as a whole.%0a%0aMost of the time, the Shadow reflects what the park looks like, but often on a grander scale. During the war this place looked ravaged and overrun, but as the Forsaken start to take their city back, the park starts to thrive, becoming colors that had not been seen before, while plants of both natural world and unnatural world start to bloom in earnest.%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25''Frick Environmental Center''%0aNestled into a hillside, the building is fronted by an allee of native trees, and is entered via a walkway and bridge. The rectilinear structure is topped with an expansive roof with deep overhangs supported by thin columns. The glass and wood facades are designed to respond to the natural surroundings.%0a%0aFrick Environmental Center is designed to not only mimic the area around it but make even the most rural of rural wolves feel comfortable within. With free admission to the public during the day, after hours it's a welcome space for the werewolf population - and their friends - to relax. %0a%0aThe Parks Conservancy, in partnership with the city of Pittsburgh, opened the new Frick Environmental Center to the public in September 2016, and in 2018 it was certified as a Living Building, achieving Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum status. %0a%0a'''Shadow:''' The Hisil of the Environmental Center is as busy as it is in the material, or perhaps even busier. With Nature spirits and Culture spirits buzzing around, it's clear that the Court of the Three Rivers and the Court of Culture hold sway here. It's not unusual to see some of the Court of Entropy out here, given their previous hold on Frick Park, or the fact that death comes to all places, but they are not in control like they used to be.%0a%0aOn the Hisil side, the Culture spirits are more than happy to present information about various parts of the Hisil, in exchange for some sort of chiminage. What sort that is depends on what sort of information one might want. It's not unusual to see Data Cat here, as a representative of the Court of Technology, trying to help the Court of Culture update their ability to share information. There are some rumors that as the material world expands their technological hold, that so will the Court of Technology do so in the Hisil.%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!%25center%25%25werewolf%25'''The Packs'''%25%25%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25''[[Players/Carrefour de Marinettes | Carrefour de Marinettes]]''%0a|| border=0%0a||!

The City of Bridges is a diplomacy spirit that has, since the war turned back to the Forsaken's advantage, risen up the ranks to rule the other spirits. It has one decree for anyone that will work with it: ''Build Bridges where you go, make allies, buffer your ranks, make friends, and keep them all safe.''%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25''Court of the Three Rivers''%0aThe Court of the Three Rivers was raised high long before the war, at least if one were to listen to the members of the court. The court as a whole remained neutral to both sides of the war, working with whomever could make a deal with them sweet enough. Composing the nature-like spirits for the city of Pittsburgh, the Court of the Three Rivers seeks to look after and manipulate nature for it's own benefit.%0a!!!!!%25center%25'''Members''':%0a*Water Spirits%0a*Nature Spirits%0a*Wolf Spirits%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25''Court of Steel''%0aThe Court of Steel used to be the top court in the city and at one point a Steel Spirit was the City Spirt. The Court of Steel did not remain neutral during the war, instead siding with the Pure during any conflicts that came about. Still in a place of high regard and honor among the other courts in the area, the court is well aware of it's falling status and that they may indeed continue to fall. As a result there are some issues between the Court of Steel and the Court of the Three Rivers, and to some extend, the Steel Spirits and the City Spirit.%0a!!!!!%25center%25'''Members''':%0a*Fire Spirits%0a*Steel Spirits%0a*Building Spirits%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25''Court of Healing''%0aThe Court of Healing is a rising court of spirits devoted to healing and medicine. A vital part of the war and daily life, the court of Healing is another court that remained largely neutral when it came to the war, and remains largely neutral to this day. That said, the court itself has made it widely known that they are willing to work with healers and those that would promote such energies.%0a!!!!!%25center%25'''Members''':%0a*Healing Spirits%0a*Hospital Spirits%0a*Medicine Spirits%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25''Court of Coins''%0aThe Court of Coins is a mid-level player in the Shadow, growing in power from the various ways that money can be used, but also struggling at the same time given all the changes that have happened over the years. Desiring to rise up the ladder, they are looking for allies that can assist them.%0a!!!!!%25center%25'''Members''':%0a*Greed Spirits%0a*Money Spirits%0a*Crypto-Currency Spirits%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25''Court of Technology''%0aThe Court of Technology is a fast rising court, coming from the lowest of the low when the Pure were in charge, to now as the Forsaken move to take back control of the city. Data Cat seems to be running the court more or less, ensuring that they have the information they need to become a major player in the Hisil.%0a!!!!!%25center%25'''Members''':%0a*Data Cat%0a*Cyber Spirits%0a*Electricty Spirits%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25''Court of Culture''%0aThe Court of Culture is another court within the city that is rising because of the Pure losing ground. Where before they had been lower level members, these days they are on their way up as Iron Masters and humanity to create works of art and culture that are worthy to be seen by others.%0a!!!!!%25center%25'''Members''':%0a*Art Spirits%0a*Museum Spirits%0a*Sculpture Spirits%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25''Court of Transportation''%0aThe Court of Transportation isn't really a rising member. While everyone needs to use the roads or railways or someway to travel, they don't seem to pay as much reverence to travel as they used to. Like some of the other courts, the Court of Transportation remained neutral during the war, favoring neither side, though some of the Road Spirits did favor the Pure.%0a!!!!!%25center%25'''Members''':%0a*Road Spirits%0a*Railway Spirits%0a*Uber Spirits%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25''Court of Corruption''%0aThe Court of Corruption is one of the two lowest courts in the city. It and the Court of Decay were strong allies of the Pure during the war and remain hard for the Forsaken to make inroads with. They seem to enjoy flaunting the decree of the City of Bridges, delighting in ruining any and all allies and bridges. This makes them difficult to work with, as sometimes you need to work with entropy and it's forces.%0a!!!!!%25center%25'''Members''':%0a*Shadow Wolves%0a*Corruption Spirits%0a*Entropy Spirits%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25''Court of Decay''%0aThe Court of Decay is one of the two lowest of the low courts in the city, and one of the two courts in the city that refuse to follow the City Spirit's decree. Having allied itself with the Pure, it struggles now as the Pure lose power. There's still plenty of death for those in the court to feast on, but soon without their ''friends'', how will the Court of Decay continue?%0a!!!!!%25center%25'''Members''':%0a*Death Spirits%0a*Carrion Spirits%0a*Rust Spirits%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!%25center%25%25werewolf%25'''The Oaths of the Moon'''%25%25%0a%0aWhile each tribe, and even each pack, put different emphasis on different parts of the laws the others, the Three Rivers Protectorate recognizes the importance of all parts of the Oath and presents it's varied opinions on it in order to create a more harmonious viewing of the Oath that we have all sworn to follow. Bare witness or be judged for your ignorance.%0a%0a''"The Oath, what can any of us say about it? It's the bonds that allow us to maintain our dualistic position, both man and beast, without becoming one or the other, or worse yet, a monster unrecognizable to our packmates and friends."'' - Mack Holt, Elodoth/Storm Lord, Carrefour de Marinettes%0a%0a''"The Oath, it's the glue that binds our culture together. The rock upon which we were built and the home upon which we survive. Pay heed to the laws, follow them. They show your honor, your strength, your willingness to stand even when it's tough to do so."'' - Jon Rodgers, Elodoth/HiD, Ferox Mors%0a%0a''"I'm not an Elodoth, but as the leader of the Valkyrja in the area I was asked to give my opinion. The Oath is what separates us from the monsters we fight. Hold to it and it will never lead you astray."'' - Lisbet Fisk, Cahalith/Iron Master, Skjoldjenter%0a%0a''"When you take away the concerns of tribe and lodge, you can focus on the purity of the Oath, and when you can do that, you've truly become a supplicant to Luna. Do not place one part above the other, but work to find the balance in your life among all of them."'' - Irene Cole, Elodoth/Ghost Wolf, No Pack%0a%0a''"I was not born into this life. I did not ask for it, but it has become the greatest joy of my life. I have a pack, a family, and I know how the Oath works for us. It maintains our culture, our society, it gives us the balance we both need and crave."'' - Rachel Waverly, Half-Moon's Birth, Boom-Boom Clash%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''Urum Da Takus'''%0a!!!!%25center%25''The Wolf Must Hunt''%0aThis tenet by far is the easiest to follow. An Uratha's heart is the hunt, and so following this tenet is easy, plus they are never spoiled for choice. Claiming territory, gathering power, it challenges those around him that would want to. Siskur-Dah was given to the wolves as their holy purpose, for them to be them, they must hunt. It is in their lifeblood.%0a%0a''"A hunt does not have to be a physical thing. One of my favorite hunts is a hunt for information. Digging up the truth or getting people to talk. Hunts should be what drives you forward, expands the territory of your pack, or improves things for the protectorate. It does not always have to be the pack chases a prey down and destroys it. We are predators, not monsters, after all."'' - Mack Holt, Elodoth/Storm Lord, Carrefour de Marinettes%0a%0a''"A good hunt is any hunt that brings you closer to whatever you desire, or brings you to what you desire. A good hunt is something you plan and work at, each member of the pack working together to bring down the foe, or gather in the information, or dig out the truth. A good hunt is our life's blood."'' - Jon Rodgers, Elodoth/HiD, Ferox Mors%0a%0a''"Good Hunts are good stories. Make yours be like both, whether it is a battle of warriors, or researchers diggin up information or social specialists finding the truth. Make your hunt a good tale for the bards to tell."'' - Lisbet Fisk, Cahalith/Iron Master, Skjoldjenter%0a%0a''"To one of us, a life without a hunt would be like a mortal without a sense - sight, taste, smell, etcetera. It’s unthinkable. Hunt and your heart will be happy."'' - Irene Cole, Elodoth/Ghost Wolf, No Pack%0a%0a''"Even among the Blooded, we understand that need for the hunt, not to the extent of the Uratha but we feel it, and we’ve lived through the results of what happens when we allow others to fight for us. Never again. We will stand shoulder to shoulder with our cousins and deny everyone the right to push us down."'' - Rachel Waverly, Half-Moon's Birth, Boom-Boom Clash%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''Imru Nu Fir Imru'''%0a!!!!%25center%25''The People Do Not Murder The People''%0aPossibly one of the more contentious tenents, The People Do Not Murder The People has many varied meanings, at least one for every Uratha that swears to our Mother. At first glance it looks as if it's proclaiming that murdering an Uratha is a giant no-no, but the reality is much more grey than such black and white would make it seem. Most Uratha follow the belief that this tenet means that you should not kill anyone with the blood of the Wolf unless you are under great duress. It should be only the last measure needed - but in times of war, such as we have faced, it is kill or be killed. Do not hesitate to slay those who would undo our Father's work or spit in our Mother's eye. Kill the Pure, kill those who have become twisted monstrosities, but do not kill each other. Do not kill the wolfblooded. Do not kill our allies.%0a%0a''"It's easy t'see it as a black and white thing. Uratha are the People. We do not murder the People. But Ashenga are also Uratha, and yet here we've been murdering each other for as far back as the murder of Father Wolf happened. And yeah, we murdered Father Wolf. But we cannot just lay down and die because our enemy has no qualms killing us. So no. Do not kill other Forsaken. Do not murder the blooded. Do not harm our allies. But also, do not lay down and die. If someone else would murder you, murder 'em the fuck first."'' - Mack Holt, Elodoth/Storm Lord, Carrefour de Marinettes%0a%0a''"Laws are what we hope we don't need when we get to a perfect world. They are, in essence, us declaring what we want. With this tenet we declare that we want never to have to kill those of our own or those with our blood. What society doesn't want that? Do not the mortal societies say 'murder is illegal' and yet in war no one is strung up for protecting their home or defending their family, or their country? The same applies here. Do not kill your allies, but if the person whom your claws or teeth have sank into has declared themselves your enemy and is willing to kill you? Do not back down."'' -  Jon Rodgers, Elodoth/HiD, Ferox Mors%0a%0a''"This tenet is far more simple than people wish to give it credit for. Do not murder your allies, do not murder the Forsaken, do not murder our wolfbloods. Murder those who would murder you."'' - Lisbet Fisk, Cahalith/Iron Master, Skjoldjenter%0a%0a''"Tenets like this are confusing because we want to not be blamed for the things we have done in war-times or during the hunt. This tenet speaks to the willing, mindful, murdering of another Uratha without any provocation or cause. War is war. But outside of it we should not act as savages."'' - Irene Cole, Elodoth/Ghost Wolf, No Pack%0a%0a''"My momma always told me to treat others as I wanted to be treated, but my daddy told me to never back down to a bully or someone who would take what is mine from me. This is the line we must walk, to treat others how we wish to be treated without becoming walking mats. Stand up for yourself and each other, and you should be fine."'' - Rachel Waverly, Half-Moon's Birth, Boom-Boom Clash%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''Sih Sehe Mak; Mak Ne Sih'''%0a!!!!%25center%25''The Low Honor The High; The High Respect The Low''%0aThe world is made and lost on hierarchies and their structure. Our society is no different. As far as our protectorate goes, we expect and demand that the Uratha following the Oath respect and honor each other. While the low might be beneath the high, they are owed respect - for without those beneath us we could not be raised high. And as the high are above the low, they are to be honored. But honor does not mean submission, for as sure as if you mistreat your dog, demanding submission from the low will be the reason you get bitten. Walk a fine line, my friend, and all will be well. Respect and honor those both above and below you, and you will have more friends than enemies, and in this war, what could be better than that?%0a%0a''"Ahhh yes, this one tends to stick in th'craw of those who have survived longer than most, or those who feel a little small where they think it's important. Look, it's simple. We are not monsters. Respect those lower than you and you will get that respect back in return. I'm sure Rachel will tell you what her momma said, but I didn't have one. What I did have was common sense. To get respect, you gotta earn it. So folks, you want to be honored? Do something worthy of it."'' - Mack Holt, Elodoth/Storm Lord, Carrefour de Marinettes%0a%0a''"This is hardly a tough tenet to understand, it's tough only in practice. I get it. After hunting and fighting to protect those who need it, you expect not just to be respected but to be honored for it. But history is littered with dictators who thought the same way. Are you a dictator, ruling your territory with an iron fist, or are you a guardian, seeking to look after and protect those within your territory? I know where I am, and it's not the former."'' - Jon Rodgers, Elodoth/HiD, Ferox Mors%0a%0a''"If you can respect your land, and respect your prey, how hard is it to respect those who need your protection? Or your care? Spend time tending to your territory and your people and you will flourish."'' - Lisbet Fisk, Cahalith/Iron Master, Skjoldjenter%0a%0a''"Darling, it's really far more simple than most want to think it is. Within a protectorate you are unlikely to be the top dog on the food chain. Do you wish to be ground beneath the heel of someone above you? No? Then do not do it to those beneath you."'' - Irene Cole, Elodoth/Ghost Wolf, No Pack%0a%0a''"Mack knows me rather well. Momma always said that when it came to people above you, you pay your respects. Yes, Ma'am, No, Sir, as you say...and so on, and to those below you, you look after and care for them. Show them the respect you wish to be shown."''  - Rachel Waverly, Half-Moon's Birth, Boom-Boom Clash%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''Ni Daha'''%0a!!!!%25center%25''Respect You Prey''%0aDo not be like the human you were before Mother Luna chose you. Be the wolf you are. Many humans have long forgotten this tenet and have lost their way with the land. They don't understand their part in the world any more, but we as Uratha, we understand the danger of becoming imbalanced. If you wish to be a strong wolf, find strong prey, and respect it. Kill it out of necessity not because you enjoy killing and your balance shall be protected.%0a%0a''"If you cannot respect your prey, you should find a better caliber of prey. Otherwise you are a weak Uratha."''  - Mack Holt, Elodoth/Storm Lord, Carrefour de Marinettes%0a%0a''"If you wish to be respected, hunt the prey that would challenge you, so that you can in turn, respect it for the joy of the hunt it gives you."''  - Jon Rodgers, Elodoth/HiD, Ferox Mors%0a%0a''"Hands down this is the tenet that is the most easily understood and easiest to follow. Only weak wolves choose prey they do not respect."'' - Lisbet Fisk, Cahalith/Iron Master, Skjoldjenter%0a%0a''"We've been at war for so long with the Pure, do you not see how we respect them? They are fierce, a threat that is so like us and yet so much unlike us. Find that respect in all of your hunts, and you will have many stories to share."'' - Irene Cole, Elodoth/Ghost Wolf, No Pack%0a%0a''"Ivan says it best, if you cannot respect those you're going after, you should put down the hunt, walk away, and find a better one. Or retire. Either way."''  - Rachel Waverly, Half-Moon's Birth, Boom-Boom Clash%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''Nu Hu Uzuz Eren'''%0a!!!!%25center%25''Do Not Eat The Flesh Of Man Or Wolf''%0aBalance is the act we as Uratha must maintain. One cannot maintain it if they are being drug into enjoying the act of eating each other or their close kin. Do not eat man or wolf willingly and guard yourself against doing so accidentally. Doing so disrupts the balance within you and breaks it down. Otherwise, prepare to lose more and more of yourself to the spirit.%0a%0a''"I feel like this one is one of those that's like a 'duh' moment. But at the same time, we all know when we lose control we sometimes take more than a bite. Y'gotta be careful about it, be mindful o'yerself and those around ya. When ya can, help yer packmates to not hafta face that themselves."'' - Mack Holt, Elodoth/Storm Lord, Carrefour de Marinettes%0a%0a''"Look, everyone of us that has changed knows the reality of this tenet. You can’t always control what happens when you lose control - so if I caution anything, it's on losing that control. Sure Father's Form has some helpful benefits in our life, but twice as many drawbacks."'' - Jon Rodgers, Elodoth/HiD, Ferox Mors%0a%0a''"When they say you are what you eat, they don't mean eat what you are. Find your nutrition where you can, but not in wolves or people. Eating that just makes you a cannibal."'' - Lisbet Fisk, Cahalith/Iron Master, Skjoldjenter%0a%0a''"I'm not sure this tenet needs further explanations. We all know there are outlying situations where when this happens we smack the wrist of the one that did it and say 'bad, don't do it again', but those cases are unwilling, accidental and happened in the moment. Going out of your way to eat mortal or wolf, that's a no-go."'' - Irene Cole, Elodoth/Ghost Wolf, No Pack%0a%0a''"...I cannot fathom why someone would eat such a thing but...yeah no that's bad."'' - Rachel Waverly, Half-Moon's Birth, Boom-Boom Clash%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''Nu Bath Githul'''%0a!!!!%25center%25''The Herd Must Not Know''%0aThe only thing more destructive than that which we have been at war for decades against, are humans. Humans are not stronger than us, but they outnumber us. Angry, determined and stubborn, humans pose a threat greater than every wolf, packed or not. We do not seek to protect the Herd with this tenet, so much as protect each other. Fail to follow this tenant and you may find yourself hunted by clever, dangerous foes who know your weaknesses.%0a%0a''"Lola don't talk much about it, but…her Gran is exactly why we have this tenet. Y'wanna see the pain and misery humanity can bring on us? Show them we exist. Ya won't forget how clever and dangerous they are after that."'' - Mack Holt, Elodoth/Storm Lord, Carrefour de Marinettes%0a%0a''"Humanity is a dangerous foe. The Iron Masters can talk to that.

Humans are not apex predators, like we are, they are super predators.

Protect the Herd, those within and outside of, your packs and alliances.%0a%0a''"We know how important it is not t'let humanity know what we are, but that doesn't mean that we avoid them.

When all falls around us, we look to the Suthar Anzuth, for they stand in the forefront of all the conflicts we face, and they show us that baring one’s throat means something worse than death - it means weakness.

With their savage hearts, they swear to Hikaon-Ur that they will never let their territory be violated, not by friend or foe, and should it be violated, they will rise to the challenge. The Meninna show us the importance of our territory and to hold it sacred, for anything less is weakness.%0a%0a''"Ni-zu tag?

Territory is important to all wolves, regardless of their Tribe, but for us and the Meninna, it means everything.

They are our society's rocks. They show us how to stand tall and show no weakness, even when fear grips at our hearts. To Skolis-Ur they swore to remain unbreakable in all aspects of the hunt. They know the importance of being stoic and rising above, for anything else would make us weak.%0a%0a''"So many folk think that this means they have to be stoic all the time. Never show their feelin's, never show their love or fear…no. That's not what it means. Being afraid doesn't make you weak. Being in love doesn't make you weak. What makes you weak are the choices that flow from that. If you allow that fear or love or whatever the emotion is to control ya, then yeah, you be weak. But if you can move forward in spite of your fear, not let your love blind you, then you aren't weak. You're strong."'' - Mack Holt, Elodoth/Storm Lord, Carrefour de Marinettes%0a%0a''"Stoicism was a philosophical school of thought back in the day that preached indifference to feelings, which I think is what causes the most confusion with this is that people feel they need to repress their emotions. We were almost all born and raised human (with few exceptions) and humans are by nature emotional beings. Emotions are not bad, but the repression of them can lead to deadly things. Temper, instead, those emotions, and seek to find answers rather than react immediately."'' - Anne Ganely, Wolfblood Skolis-Ur's Birth, Boom-Boom Clash%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!%25center%25%25werewolf%25'''Oathbreakers'''%25%25%0aAs much as we might like to presume that the People are perfect, they are not.  In any society you have individuals who violate that society's rules whether they choose to do so or it happens. We, the Uratha, are a passionate group, and that passion can lead us as much astray as it can to victory. All too often a young Uratha gives into that passion, often when in Gauru, and breaks the oath, falling to the easy temptations of the spirit or the body. Doing so can only invite punishment - but of what sort of punishments might be involved? Here we shall break down and discuss what happens after someone's broken the Oath.%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25''Procedures''%0aFirst and foremost, they should answer to their pack - unless of course their packmates were involved in the crime. Any breach of a tenant (or more) of the oath reflects poorly on the pack as a whole. If their packmates were involved, or they are a lone wolf without a pack, then they should answer to their Tribe. Should the offender be a Ghost Wolf with no Tribe, then they will answer to the aggrieved party.%0a%0aWhile the aggrieved party is not allowed to break the oath in retaliation (whether they've sworn to it or not), however, they can certainly stretch out how far they can take it. If two packs are involved, then the Elodoths of both packs should be involved in the settling of the crime, however if one pack is without an Elodoth they might reach out to Irene Cole or another pack's Elodoth to help. If none can be found then they can turn to the Lunes, or tribal or lodge spirits for counsel on how to handle the situation.%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25''Less Severe Violations''%0aThese violations still require serious consideration. Crimes can range from minor to unforgiveable. %0a!!!!!%25center%25'''Examples'''%0aDoing something dumb like foolishly challenging a pack leader's authority or defacing the property of another pack.%0a!!!!!%25center%25'''Punishment'''%0aThese violations warrant light punishments, such as minor injuries that are temporary like a broken bone or cutting that will heal and leave no scar. Additionally a harsh talk from a highly renowned individual or the wrong pack can stain the offender’s honor for several nights. Finally, the temporary denial of some basic pleasure or desire such as the right to see someone they love or to temporarily be told to leave her territory are fair.%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25''Willing Violations''%0a!!!!!%25center%25'''Examples'''%0aCannibalism, killing other Uratha for petty reasons or betraying the Oath to satisfy some sort of personal desire all invite grave punishments. %0a!!!!!%25center%25'''Punishment'''%0aWillingly breaking the most important tenets warrants far harsher punishments. Casting such offenders from pack and tribe, or having a limb removed with a silver blade are acceptable punishments, though the former is often the greatest of the two punishments.%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25''Defiling Honor''%0aFinally, defiling the honor of the Forsaken and the Oath's very meaning requires the offender to face the harshest of all punishments. Only the worst sins count here. %0a!!!!!%25center%25'''Examples'''%0aDeliberately exposing the People to humanity or the willingly betrayal of the Uratha's pack to the enemy stand as examples here. %0a!!!!!%25center%25'''Punishments'''%0aPunishments for such things are often death, exile, or imprisonment by the Lunes. Worst of all could be facing the very wrath of Mother Luna herself, and to date no one knows or wishes to guess that she might inflict upon those who betray her.%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a(:include GameRef.Directoryhelp:)

Ferox Mors maintains Tur and patrols it to keep it safe for the Uratha to use.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''Frick Park''%0a%3c Frick Park is an ideal escape from the noise of the city. Known as Pittsburgh's woodland park for its extensive trails through steep valleys and wooded slopes.%0a%3c %0a%3c Although Henry Clay Frick bequeathed the original 151 acres to the city in 1919, the park did not open until 1927 after additional land had been acquired. Most recently, 106 acres were annexed to the park as part of the process that created the Summerset at Frick Park housing development and restored the Nine Mile Run stream valley. Today, Frick Park stretches from its northern borders in Point Breeze down to the Monongahela River.%0a%3c %0a%3c Birding enthusiasts love to visit Clayton Hill, where more than 100 species of birds have been recorded. Children flock to the famous Blue Slide Playground and learn about nature at the Frick Environmental Center. The park also features red clay tennis courts, baseball fields, and the only public lawn bowling green in Pennsylvania.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy has completed extensive ecological restoration work in Frick Park since it's first capital project in 2000, the restoration of Reynolds Street gatehouse entrance. %0a%3c %0a%3c Frick Park is the largest park in Pittsburgh, and one of the first major locations the Forsaken were able to take as their own, thanks to an enterprising member of the Hunters in Darkness tribe who not only saw the use of the land, but also secured the area with various traps and alerts so they Pure couldn’t regain the land. It is the main meeting grounds for the Forsaken in Pittsburgh, and where all the moots will be held.%0a%3c %0a%3c With a variety of trails and activities, individuals who visit won’t find themselves bored, while the Forsaken don’t have to be found unless they wish to. %0a%3c %0a%3c '''Shadow:''' The Hisil of the Park is marred by the skirmishes and wars that have been fought there. Death and Carrion spirits fight for space with Healing spirits, but the latter is starting to gain ground with the aid of the Three Rivers Court starting to take more prominence in the area and the Court of Entropy and Corruption losing its hold and positions within the city as a whole.%0a%3c %0a%3c Most of the time, the Shadow reflects what the park looks like, but often on a grander scale. During the war this place looked ravaged and overrun, but as the Forsaken start to take their city back, the park starts to thrive, becoming colors that had not been seen before, while plants of both natural world and unnatural world start to bloom in earnest.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''Frick Environmental Center''%0a%3c Nestled into a hillside, the building is fronted by an allée of native trees, and is entered via a walkway and bridge. The rectilinear structure is topped with an expansive roof with deep overhangs supported by thin columns. The glass and wood facades are designed to respond to the natural surroundings.%0a%3c %0a%3c Frick Environmental Center is designed to not only mimic the area around it but make even the most rural of rural wolves feel comfortable within. With free admission to the public during the day, after hours it’s a welcome space for the werewolf population - and their friends - to relax. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Parks Conservancy, in partnership with the city of Pittsburgh, opened the new Frick Environmental Center to the public in September 2016, and in 2018 it was certified as a Living Building, achieving Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum status. %0a%3c %0a%3c '''Shadow:''' The Hisil of the Environmental Center is as busy as it is in the material, or perhaps even busier. With Nature spirits and Culture spirits buzzing around, it’s clear that the Court of the Three Rivers and the Court of Culture hold sway here. It’s not unusual to see some of the Court of Entropy out here, given their previous hold on Frick Park, or the fact that death comes to all places, but they are not in control like they used to be.%0a%3c %0a%3c On the Hisil side, the Culture spirits are more than happy to present information about various parts of the Hisil, in exchange for some sort of chiminage. What sort that is depends on what sort of information one might want. It’s not unusual to see Data Cat here, as a representative of the Court of Technology, trying to help the Court of Culture update their ability to share information. There are some rumors that as the material world expands their technological hold, that so will the Court of Technology do so in the Hisil.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c No werewolf should hunt alone.

An Uratha's heart is the hunt, and so following this tenet is easy, plus they are never spoiled for choice. Claiming territory, gathering power, it challenges those around him that would want to. Siskur-Dah was given to the wolves as their holy purpose, for them to be them, they must hunt. It is in their lifeblood.%0a%3c %0a%3c ''"A hunt does not have to be a physical thing. One of my favorite hunts is a hunt for information. Digging up the truth or getting people to talk. Hunts should be what drives you forward, expands the territory of your pack, or improves things for the protectorate. It does not always have to be the pack chases a prey down and destroys it. We are predators, not monsters, after all."'' - Mack Holt, Elodoth/Storm Lord, Carrefour de Marinettes%0a%3c %0a%3c ''"A good hunt is any hunt that brings you closer to whatever you desire, or brings you to what you desire.

At first glance it looks as if it's proclaiming that murdering an Uratha is a giant no-no, but the reality is much more grey than such black and white would make it seem. Most Uratha follow the belief that this tenet means that you should not kill anyone with the blood of the Wolf unless you are under great duress. It should be only the last measure needed - but in times of war, such as we have faced, it is kill or be killed. Do not hesitate to slay those who would undo our Father's work or spit in our Mother's eye. Kill the Pure, kill those who have become twisted monstrosities, but do not kill each other. Do not kill the wolfblooded. Do not kill our allies.%0a%3c %0a%3c ''"It’s easy t’see it as a black and white thing. Uratha are the People. We do not murder the People. But Ashenga are also Uratha, and yet here we’ve been murdering each other for as far back as the murder of Father Wolf happened. And yeah, we murdered Father Wolf. But we cannot just lay down and die because our enemy has no qualms killing us. So no. Do not kill other Forsaken. Do not murder the blooded. Do not harm our allies. But also, do not lay down and die. If someone else would murder you, murder ‘em the fuck first."'' - Mack Holt, Elodoth/Storm Lord, Carrefour de Marinettes%0a%3c %0a%3c ''"Laws are what we hope we don’t need when we get to a perfect world. They are, in essence, us declaring what we want. With this tenet we declare that we want never to have to kill those of our own or those with our blood. What society doesn’t want that? Do not the mortal societies say ‘murder is illegal’ and yet in war no one is strung up for protecting their home or defending their family, or their country? The same applies here. Do not kill your allies, but if the person whom your claws or teeth have sank into has declared themselves your enemy and is willing to kill you? Do not back down."'' -  Jon Rodgers, Elodoth/HiD, Ferox Mors%0a%3c %0a%3c ''"This tenet is far more simple than people wish to give it credit for. Do not murder your allies, do not murder the Forsaken, do not murder our wolfbloods. Murder those who would murder you."'' - Lisbet Fisk, Cahalith/Iron Master, Skjoldjenter%0a%3c %0a%3c ''"Tenets like this are confusing because we want to not be blamed for the things we have done in war-times or during the hunt.

But outside of it we should not act as savages."'' - Irene Cole, Elodoth/Ghost Wolf, No Pack%0a%3c %0a%3c ''"My momma always told me to treat others as I wanted to be treated, but my daddy told me to never back down to a bully or someone who would take what is mine from me.

Our society is no different. As far as our protectorate goes, we expect and demand that the Uratha following the Oath respect and honor each other. While the low might be beneath the high, they are owed respect - for without those beneath us we could not be raised high. And as the high are above the low, they are to be honored. But honor does not mean submission, for as sure as if you mistreat your dog, demanding submission from the low will be the reason you get bitten. Walk a fine line, my friend, and all will be well. Respect and honor those both above and below you, and you will have more friends than enemies, and in this war, what could be better than that?%0a%3c %0a%3c ''"Ahhh yes, this one tends to stick in th’craw of those who have survived longer than most, or those who feel a little small where they think it’s important. Look, it’s simple. We are not monsters. Respect those lower than you and you will get that respect back in return. I’m sure Rachel will tell you what her momma said, but I didn’t have one.

Do something worthy of it."'' - Mack Holt, Elodoth/Storm Lord, Carrefour de Marinettes%0a%3c %0a%3c ''"This is hardly a tough tenet to understand, it’s tough only in practice. I get it. After hunting and fighting to protect those who need it, you expect not just to be respected but to be honored for it. But history is littered with dictators who thought the same way.

I know where I am, and it’s not the former."'' - Jon Rodgers, Elodoth/HiD, Ferox Mors%0a%3c %0a%3c ''"If you can respect your land, and respect your prey, how hard is it to respect those who need your protection?

What makes you weak are the choices that flow from that. If you allow that fear or love or whatever the emotion is to control ya, then yeah, you be weak.

In any society you have individuals who violate that society’s rules whether they choose to do so or it happens. We, the Uratha, are a passionate group, and that passion can lead us as much astray as it can to victory. All too often a young Uratha gives into that passion, often when in Gauru, and breaks the oath, falling to the easy temptations of the spirit or the body. Doing so can only invite punishment - but of what sort of punishments might be involved? Here we shall break down and discuss what happens after someone’s broken the Oath.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''Procedures''%0a%3c First and foremost, they should answer to their pack - unless of course their packmates were involved in the crime. Any breach of a tenant (or more) of the oath reflects poorly on the pack as a whole. If their packmates were involved, or they are a lone wolf without a pack, then they should answer to their Tribe. Should the offender be a Ghost Wolf with no Tribe, then they will answer to the aggrieved party.%0a%3c %0a%3c While the aggrieved party is not allowed to break the oath in retaliation (whether they’ve sworn to it or not), however, they can certainly stretch out how far they can take it. If two packs are involved, then the Elodoths of both packs should be involved in the settling of the crime, however if one pack is without an Elodoth they might reach out to Irene Cole or another pack’s Elodoth to help. If none can be found then they can turn to the Lunes, or tribal or lodge spirits for counsel on how to handle the situation.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''Less Severe Violations''%0a%3c These violations still require serious consideration. Crimes can range from minor to unforgiveable. %0a%3c !!!!!%25center%25'''Examples'''%0a%3c Doing something dumb like foolishly challenging a pack leader’s authority or defacing the property of another pack.%0a%3c !!!!!%25center%25'''Punishment'''%0a%3c These violations warrant light punishments, such as minor injuries that are temporary like a broken bone or cutting that will heal and leave no scar. Additionally a harsh talk from a highly renowned individual or the wrong pack can stain the offender’s honor for several nights. Finally, the temporary denial of some basic pleasure or desire such as the right to see someone they love or to temporarily be told to leave her territory are fair.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''Willing Violations''%0a%3c !!!!!%25center%25'''Examples'''%0a%3c Cannibalism, killing other Uratha for petty reasons or betraying the Oath to satisfy some sort of personal desire all invite grave punishments. %0a%3c !!!!!%25center%25'''Punishment'''%0a%3c Willingly breaking the most important tenets warrants far harsher punishments. Casting such offenders from pack and tribe, or having a limb removed with a silver blade are acceptable punishments, though the former is often the greatest of the two punishments.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''Defiling Honor''%0a%3c Finally, defiling the honor of the Forsaken and the Oath’s very meaning requires the offender to face the harshest of all punishments. Only the worst sins count here. %0a%3c !!!!!%25center%25'''Examples'''%0a%3c Deliberately exposing the People to humanity or the willingly betrayal of the Uratha’s pack to the enemy stand as examples here. %0a%3c !!!!!%25center%25'''Punishments'''%0a%3c Punishments for such things are often death, exile, or imprisonment by the Lunes. Worst of all could be facing the very wrath of Mother Luna herself, and to date no one knows or wishes to guess that she might inflict upon those who betray her.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> %0a> !!!!%25center%25''[[Players.Skalds|Skalds]]''%0a> %0a> %0a> ||!

Dr. Fairchild was known for traveling the world in search of useful plants, but he was also an educator and a renowned scientist. At the age of 22, he created the Section of Foreign Seed and Plant Introduction of the United States Department of Agriculture, and for the next 37 years he traveled the world in search of plants of potential use to the American people.  In 1898, David Fairchild established the USDA Plant Introduction Garden in Florida and continued to travel and explore to add to the ever-growing collection.  What the history books leave out, of course, is that David Fairchild was a Ithaeur Bone Shadow, and the travels his team undertook were cover for his pack�s movements to better study the Hisil and its denizens around the world.%0a> %0a> Upon his retirement in 1935 Dr. Fairchild returned to Miami with his pack and they joined a group of passionate plant collectors and horticulturists, including retired accountant Col. Robert H. Montgomery (1872-1953), environmentalist Marjory Stoneman Douglas, County Commissioner Charles Crandon and landscape architect William Lyman Phillips. This core group worked tirelessly to bring the idea of a one of a kind botanic garden to life, and in 1938 the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden opened its 83 acres to the public for the first time. Col. Montgomery, who founded the Garden, named it to honor his friend. Many plants still growing in the Garden were collected by Dr. Fairchild, including a giant African baobab tree by the Gate House. In 1940, Dr. Fairchild embarked on the Garden's first official collecting expedition, sailing from the Philippines to the Indonesian archipelago on a special oceangoing Chinese junk called the Cheng Ho. The voyage provided many of the Garden's early botanical specimens before the outbreak of World War II forced the explorers to return home.%0a> %0a> Dr Fairchild married Marian Hubbard Bell and the pair of them had two children, a son Graham Fairchild, and daughter Nancy Fairchild.  Upon his retirement a sizeable number of the family that was still living in Connecticut - where the American branch of the family line originated from well after their arrival from England in the 1630s - moved down to Florida to join the good doctor and help keep the Botanic Garden open and running smoothly.%0a> %0a> The family developed a safe place for themselves called Kampong, located in Coconut Grove.  Marian�s sister & her husband Gilbert Grosvenor bought the property to the north that adjoined Kampong.  After David and Marian passed away Catherine Sweeney, a second cousin connected to the Fairchild�s, bought the property and maintained its upkeep.  Others in the Sweeney family helped to develop the Pacific Tropical Botanical Garden (now National Tropical Botanical Garden) and now own the property, though it is still used by all those connected to the Fairchilds.%0a> %0a> The blood of the Urfarah has always run deep in the family lines, with multiple Changes occurring each generation and a sizable number of wolf-blooded beyond that; the current generation boasts no less than four wolves and one blooded from one branch of the family alone, for example.  While some have decided to pack with family members exclusively others have branched out, making new bonds with other local Uratha to expand their own personal horizons.  Members of the family claim membership with all of the Forsaken tribes, although the Bone Shadows and Iron Masters see more prevalence.%0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> !!!!!%25center%25Other family names: Sweeney, Grosvenor, Bell%0a> %0a> %0a> !!!!!%25center%25Head of the Family \\%0a> %0a> %25center%25'''Aubrey Fairchild(nee Grosvenor)'''  \\%0a> %25center%25''Bone Shadows Elodoth'' \\%0a> Wife/Mate to Evan Fairchild.

Working for Henry Flagler, Sewell served as foreman and superintendent for the Florida East Coast Railway during the construction of the line from Jacksonville to Miami and later joined the hotel construction department. After helping to construct The Royal Poinciana Hotel and The Breakers Hotel at Palm Beach, Sewell moved to Miami in 1896 to work on the Royal Palm Hotel. While working on the hotel, Sewell stumbled upon the burial grounds of the Tequesta Native-Americans. Sewell gave away some of the skulls as souvenirs, and ordered African-American laborers to move the remaining bones and bury them in a hole, he did this to see if he could provoke some of the local Native American Spirits into showing themselves. Sewell remained in the employ of the Florida East Coast Railway until 1899, when he left to concentrate his efforts on the mercantile establishment jointly owned with this brother. He was Mayor of the City of Miami from 1903 to 1907.%0a> %0a> After serving in local politics, Sewell began the construction of his family home in 1912. Built on the highest point in the city, the house was named Halissee Hall from the Seminole word meaning "New Moon." He married a young Hunter in Darkness Elodoth named Mary Jones, having six children over the years.  Four made it to adulthood, two of whom followed in their parents� footsteps under Luna�s light.%0a> %0a> Sewell wrote a self-published autobiography entitled John Sewell's Memoirs and History of Miami, Florida. It included an appendix describing his witnessing the attempted assassination of president-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933. The book is valuable as a primary source of information on pioneer days in Miami.  Upon his death he was buried in Miami City Cemetery.%0a> %0a> John�s brother Everest George "E. G." Sewell ( September 17, 1874 � April 2, 1940) opened their first business north of the Miami River on March 26, 1896. In February 1916 he was elected as president of Miami Chamber of Commerce and was re-elected every year until 1925 (except for 1919). He was elected as Mayor of Miami in 1927, 1933, and twice in 1939 (once as a recall and one during a proper election).  While EG never changed he use his power as mayor to cover up incidents that would have exposed the local Uratha to undue scrutiny.%0a> %0a> EG married a young woman named Lucinda Blackwell, an Elodoth of the Iron Masters whom he met when she worked in his first store.  She was with him every step of the way on his political career, helping him and acting as the perfect Mayor's wife.  She gave him a total of seven children, but only three made it to adulthood.  Only one of the children, a young man named George, changed under the full moon and chose to join the Hunters in Darkness. EG died two days after suffering a heart attack on April 2, 1940 at Jackson Memorial Hospital, and was honored by having a nature park in Miami named after him.%0a> %0a> While not as Uratha-rich as the Fairchilds the Sewell family lines still boast a notable number of Blooded, with a network of connections forged between different packs in the area through pack bond, marriage or both.

Immigration usually entails violation of ancestral ties and parental obligations. Dealing in their youths with convulsive change, thrown back on their own devices to create a productive existence, ripped untimely from the womb of a settled life, immigrants everywhere suffer the guilts of disconnection from their homes and families and ally easily with the forces of the future against the claims of the past. Shaped by a fractured or betrayed conservatism, however, the immigrant's most revolutionary creations usually reverberate with remembered values. In forging a new world, he continually restores the old.%0a> %0a> In the history of the United States, each new flood of immigrants has enacted this essential drama of abandonment and rebuilding. But in recent years, no group has played it out with the energy and resourcefulness of the Cubans who fled Castro's Cuba in rage and fear and settled first in Miami, Florida.%0a> %0a> The city did not seem ready for them. For the economy of central Miami, 1961 was a grim year. In the inner-city area around the Tamiami Trail, more than 1,000 homes with Federal Housing Administration mortgages had been vacated, and many were vandalized for their copper pipe and electrical fixtures. Local shops gasped for customers and went broke; 40-year-old Burdine's, the chief downtown department store, was languishing helplessly as its clientele moved toward the suburbs. Even Miami Beach, the supreme American resort across the Bay of Biscayne, was slipping perceptibly past its prime, as wealthy northern tourists increasingly passed it by for mellower island shores to the south.%0a> %0a> To many observers, the arrival of the Cubans seemed a deadly blow to the city's hope for recovery. Some 200,000 had already fled Castro's burgeoning dictatorship, and more arrived daily. Castro had proclaimed a new law of potestas patria under which he was abolishing Catholic schools, establishing centers for communist indoctrination, incarcerating dissidents, and commandeering lawyers and other white-collar people for labor in the sugar fields. Refugees flocked the Miami airport in painful confusion then clustered five or more to a room in Miami bungalows and apartments, looking for jobs that didn�t exist in the struggling Dade County economy and confidently awaiting deliverance�and vicarious vengeance�through a brutal charge of US Marines onto the beaches of Cuba, ordered by America's macho new president, John F. Kennedy.%0a> %0a> Some 13,000 of the immigrants came as unaccompanied children, landing in Miami without kin, a grasp of the English language, and many with only a vague connection in the United States. They had been packed off by desperate parents and left to be processed in refugee camps and then passed on to orphanages and foster homes. Many of the immigrants of all ages were channeled first to other communities, but most of them gravitated back to southern Florida, the area closest to their prior home and most acculturated with Cubans.%0a> %0a> All statistical projections were dismal. Experts foresaw a prolonged siege of medical crises, economic stresses, and ethnic frictions; a teeming burden of "social disorders," needs for housing, welfare, and simple hygiene�an impossible load for the already afflicted social services of the city. Here in one economically stagnant urban area, over a period of just two years, thronged some 200,000 penurious immigrants�more than the total of black unemployed youths in all of America's urban areas at the time, concentrated in the hard core of one central city. It was an influx about one-fifth the size of the entire Dade County population in 1960, an inundation more rapid and overwhelming than any previous migration to one American city.%0a> %0a> Few of the arrivals spoke English, and virtually none had arranged for jobs or housing. Many had been reasonably well educated and well employed in Cuba, but their experience and credentials were often irrelevant in the United States. Doctors, architects, and lawyers escaped the sugar fields only to work as busboys, bootblacks, and parking-lot attendants. Nearly 60 percent of the exiles had been common laborers even in Cuba, and all had lost most of what they had accumulated at home. From the press coverage and political comment of the day it is difficult to find any observers who saw this human flood as anything but a tribulation for southern Florida or a problem to be solved by saviors at the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and the Immigration and Naturalization Service�or the US Marines.%0a> %0a> The Cubans' saviors, however, were already at hand: they would be saved by themselves�not chiefly by a trickle-down of grants from the government, but by the upsurge of their own productive efforts. They would be saved by people like Jos� Palmero, penniless, having invested his last dollars in some second hand records to peddle door to door; by Armando Codina, then a frightened, gangly youth, with just two words of English, hamburger and Coke, assigned to a refugee camp.%0a> %0a> Armando Cordina settled in among the others in what would soon be called Little Havana.  Armando himself fled for the same reason many of the others did.  While most of them had what folks would consider proper jobs back in Cuba, Armando�s skill set lay in the more �grey� area.  He was, however, very charismatic and used the connections with his �family� back home to gather other orphans of the crisis under his wing and start a proper trade in the less legal pleasures of life.   They started first with weed in small batches and some cocaine and cigars, later expanding to other narcotics as the market grew.  Armando pressed upon his newfound family that they find legitimate cover jobs to explain where their money came from, however, and most did: gophers, day laborers, sanitation work and child care helped to cover their tracks and offer additional income to the group besides.  %0a> %0a> Not long after his arrival a local cigar owner, Roy Shapiro, took a chance on Armando and hired the youth at his store Viva Cigar Lounge.  Soon he noticed Armando�s abilities with rolling cigars by hand and was quite happy with the money made off the counterfeit Cuban cigars that he and his friends rolled.  Armando put his nose to the grindstone, splitting his time between the store, the business handled by his �family� and the side business that fueled everything else.  When Roy decided to �retire� to Palm Springs he sold the store to Armando, trusting the young man to continue the good work he had been doing there.  %0a> %0a> With the store now in the hands of the Cordina Family they flourished, using the steady supply of Cuban cigars they were able to get in around the embargo to their advantage.  Armando pioneered a near-foolproof technique for cutting some of the actual Cubans with normal cigars, mixing the tobacco within before rerolling and relabeling them to near perfection to increase their stock of the product and adding to their profits.  As far as the public saw, Armando Cordina and his family seemed like a typical success story.  They had come here from Cuba with nothing, and with the successful business plan they opened two more Viva Cigar stores, both in prominent hotels in the area owned by the Sewell family.%0a>   %0a> In the 80�s when another flood of Cubans came to Miami, the family�s ranks swelled as many of those who�d come over in the 60�s asked their families to join them, bringing in more and more connections.  Armando helped send many of the children born in Miami to good schools and on to college using the grey money to fund it.  In return he got well educated young Uratha and blooded to help protect the family, keeping as much as he could in house  With their help he kept up the drug running and was able to bring in new shipment lines from Cuba down into Miami.%0a> %0a> Armando had already Changed under the Half Moon back in Cuba, leaving behind his pack as they were not able to make the journey himself.  A number of the motley crew that he had assorted upon his arrival was also touched by the Moon, having gone through the Change as well or showed tells of being blooded.  A core part of the now-extended family still maintains this tie to the Urfarah, with the Storm Lords and Iron Masters most prominent.%0a>    %0a> %0a> !!!!!%25center%25Other family names: Palmero, Oyarzun, Valls%0a> %0a> %0a> !!!!!%25center%25Head of the Family \\%0a> %0a> %25center%25'''Armando Codina'''  \\%0a> %25center%25''Storm Lord Elodoth'' \\%0a> One of the elder statesmen among the urban Uratha of Miami, the Elodoth does his best to keep his son�s ambitions in check as well as those of the other packmates.

Mateo feels that the family, the pack, are not doing enough. Sure they are doing well and making a name for themselves but they need to push for more. Mateo wants to bring in even more people for the family, push bigger volumes of drugs, push more than just cigars and some cocaine, why not heroin? Why not weapons? The young Rahu is hungry for all that could be, and the firm hand of his father upon his ambitions only serves to stir the anger in his heart.%0a> *'''Diego Palmero'''%0a> **''Iron Master Cahalith''%0a> **Diego Palermo, the resident Cahalith, is one of the best pushers there could be. The guy could sell ice to the best ice salesman there was. Always a smile on his face, and one of very few Uratha to ever stay overweight; he is almost constantly snacking, usually with a bag of potato chips on him somewhere. On the streets he goes by The Slug, because when he passes you drugs he's always got some sort of food substance on his hands that comes with, leaving their hands a slimy mess after the exchange.%0a> *'''Zelia Codina'''%0a> **''Storm Lord Ithaeur''%0a> **Is any pack really complete without an Ithaeur? This one sure wouldn't be. Zelia is the financial brains of the operation behind her father Armando, handling the various accounts and ensuring that the streams of income that shouldn�t touch don�t.

Theirs is a lust for life few humans can understand. They hunt to survive. They feel the rush of blood in their veins and from the open wounds of their prey. Death intertwines with life, and fury with joy. Bound not by human authority or morality, they are monsters who hunt monsters. Without a guiding purpose, many would descend into atavistic madness. All Forsaken have a purpose, however: the Oath of the Moon, sworn to their moon-god/dess in the name of their dead Father.%0a> %0a> The Oath binds Uratha to a code of savage harmony. It defines ''Siskur-Dah'', the legacy of ''Urfarah''. It helps Luna�s shapeshifting brood find its place in a world of animistic duality. Above all, the Oath is a weapon against degeneration into a mindless beast. By the Oath are Forsaken lifted above half-blind humans and mere wolves and spirits. Through it they gain strength, a creed, and an outlet through which to express their dedication. Even the Pure swear a version of the Oath, though each tribe has its own variations, and none of the ''Anshega'' would ever swear it to Luna. Other spirits, those that hate the Forsaken for their role in the death of ''Urfarah'', judge each Pure based on the form of the Oath that he took.  The Oath is a silver chain binding the monster. Yet it also drives those it binds to be better than they are. Mother Luna watches over her children still, and they know it through the presence of Lunes, the mad moon spirits. Lunes judge the Oath, exalting its champions and condemning its transgressors. Each of the Lunes is as bipolar as its mother, and while one might decry a werewolf for not upholding the Oath strongly enough, it might also barely react when she achieves a great success. No one said adhering to a creed of primeval hunters and capricious spirits would ever be easy.%0a> %0a> Not all punishments come from the Lunes. Werewolves who reject the Oath become lost in the hunt without guidance or support from the Firstborn. Some reject the Oath out of wickedness, and so become little more than cunning beasts who sometimes wear human skin. Ignoring the Oath is a sure way to lose one�s grip on the things that make the Uratha who, rather than what, they are. Without balance, werewolves can become trapped in one form or even one world. In time, they forget even what they once were, becoming as single-minded and inflexible as spirits.%0a> %0a> Several tenets comprise the Oath. Each tribe (indeed, each pack) places greater importance on some of the laws than it does the others. The added significance is in regard to tribe�s favored prey and its view of a proper world. Some werewolves pay only lip service to one tenet. The more devout take every law as sacred. In the end, not even her packmates can determine how a werewolf approaches the Oath; it is a decision she must make for herself.%0a> %0a> !!!%25center%25'''Urum Da Takus'''%0a> !!!!%25center%25''The Wolf Must Hunt''%0a> *No werewolf can transgress against this tenet, for it is the beating heart of his existence. The People hunt. They revere Siskur-Dahas their most holy purpose. To them, it is not just a way of life; the hunt is life. It is Father Wolf�s greatest legacy.  Only werewolves can hunt like Urfarahonce did. Every pack has its own rituals of the hunt, as does every Ghost Wolf. Like any religious law, this tenet is a point of contention among rivals and enemies. A pack�s solemn duty is to hunt, whether things of flesh or spirit or both. Failure to do so causes other packs to doubt the pack�s commitment, using it as an excuse (real or feigned) to move on its territory. Bloody clashes under the moon usually follow, threatening the sanctity of the Oath�s next most important clause.%0a> !!!%25center%25'''Imru Nu Fir Imru'''%0a> !!!!%25center%25''The People Do Not Murder The People''%0a> *A subject of many tribal debates and heated blood feuds, this tenet says that murdering other Uratha is a grave sin. It is both specific and ambiguous, which of course only adds to the confusion. Most agree the law makes it taboo to kill anyone with the blood of the Wolf except at great need. Many Uratha think of Wolf-Blooded and human pack members as part of the People, and thus their lives are equally sacred.  Nearly as many interpretations of this law exist as there are packs in the world. Open challenges of dominance resulting in accidental death might be considered acceptable to some, while murder of an unaware victim is a heinous crime. Lunes offer little help interpreting the law, their words every bit as contradictory as clashing Forsaken beliefs. Most werewolves assume that beating another werewolf is acceptable within the Oath. Slaying a defeated foe is murder. Killing when unnecessary � whether prey or fellow werewolf � is a sin, especially when the victim is one of your own kind. Elodoth argue with their packs and with one another about whether or not the law includes the Pure Tribes. Some Pure seem to believe that killing Forsaken is taboo, although torture doesn�t violate the law. Likewise, some Forsaken refuse to kill the Pure except when the Pure would murder them, and even then sing their lament to wolf and moon.%0a> !!!%25center%25'''Sih Sehe Mak; Mak Ne Sih'''%0a> !!!!%25center%25''The Low Honor The High; The High Respect The Low''%0a> *Uratha are intimately familiar with dominance and submission. Many humans and spirits feign distaste at the idea, but they, too, abide by hierarchies. The world simply won�t allow equality for everyone, and the Forsaken know it. If the prey is stronger than the pack, the pack must bring it to its level. If one pack is stronger than another, the stronger will wins out. It is the law of the wild. Younger werewolves with heads full of pride rebuke the authority of the elders. They feel the elders enforce this law, or perhaps made it up entirely, simply to wield power. In turn, the elders bear their scars, sing of their bloody glories, and take what they feel is their due. Wise elders know that the second half of the clause demands they show respect for pups and young hunters, and afford their less experienced kin that respect. Even the old and strong can have their throats torn out by angry pups. Attitudes toward this law vary within protectorates. In some, elders are given proper deference both for their ability as hunters and their wisdom as Forsaken. Some grow cruel or brutal. They fall out of balance and meet their ends at the claws of the oppressed. Some keep young werewolves in line when even the Oath can�t always guide them. All respect the Firstborn and the ways that the Forsaken have followed since prehistory. If wise elders know that they should respect the young hunters, then wise pups know to respect the scarred veterans for their knowledge and prowess.%0a> !!!%25center%25'''Ni Daha'''%0a> !!!!%25center%25''Respect You Prey''%0a> ***Humans long ago abandoned this law and suffer for it. Werewolves fully know the dangers of imbalance. Their ability to hunt suffers. Their territories fall into decline. They grow weak, as did Urfarahin his final days, and soon meet their ends. Wisdom teaches that werewolves should respect their prey. Strong prey shapes strong predators, and vice versa. It is a precarious balance. A pack that kills callously gains enemies among spirits who see them as cruel barbarians. Indifference to the deaths of animals and spirits leads to losing respect for the hunt itself. A true predator kills out of necessity, not mere desire. Respect your prey, and it in turn respects your place as its predator. Spirits lash out at needlessly vicious werewolves, but those who properly respect the hunt earn the Shadow�s begrudging respect as a necessary part of the natural order. Even the most selfish spirits can recognize the honor and savage nobility of the Uratha.  Some Uratha take this a step further. When one of these werewolves kills a deer, she understands that the animal has given its life that hers can continue. She respects the weight of the act. For most, killing is simply about necessity. Creatures like the Hosts and Claimed must be killed before they kill werewolves in turn. Respecting your prey means respecting the need for werewolves to hunt it. These creatures are deadly monsters in their own right.  Even humans are not exempt from Uratha predation, something which younger werewolves often have difficulty grasping. Humans can be prey, and in many cases must be, though the Oath forbids consumption of human flesh. Older werewolves, and those who quickly take to their roles as the ultimate predators, feel no more remorse for killing humans than they do for any other creature. Merciful werewolves might warn humans off first through various terrifying means. Just as many kill them as readily as they would their next meal.%0a> !!!%25center%25'''Nu Hu Uzuz Eren'''%0a> !!!!%25center%25''Do Not Eat The Flesh Of Man Or Wolf''%0a> *The act provides power and pleasure, a rush of Essence and a perverse satisfaction of basest urges. It is a surrender of honor and control, and no meat is sweeter upon the tongue of a hungry werewolf. The rush of power is too much, though. To a werewolf, eating her own kind, or her close kin, is a grave temptation that also drags her closer to the spirit than the flesh.  Forsaken lorekeepers have long wondered at the truth of the matter. This clause is one of the oldest and certainly the clearest. Some Uratha then wonder if the temptation has always existed, deliberately left by the mad moon-goddess or born in Father Wolf�s death at the claws and teeth of his own progeny. Perhaps it is an eternal reminder of that grave act. Whatever its origin, it remains a temptation and a threat to a werewolf�s soul. In the throes of Kuruth, even the most disciplined Uratha might devour her kill and remember the taste through the mists of Rage. No werewolf is safe from this temptation, even those who have never tasted the power of the sweetest meats.%0a> !!!%25center%25'''Nu Bath Githul'''%0a> !!!!%25center%25''The Herd Must Not Know''%0a> *Werewolves are mightier than any human, but not invincible. Angry, determined humans threaten even a pack. %0a> Guns and bombs quickly even up the score, and those few hunters capable of standing against the Uratha know some of their weaknesses. Younger werewolves laugh at the thought, thinking themselves immortal. This law protects against that headstrong thinking; it was born of a need to protect werewolves, not humans. A large-scale war between humans and werewolves would end badly for the werewolves. Even if the Uratha won a protracted war against their human kin, the results would devastate the world. Cunning werewolves stick to the shadows, hunting at night or across the Gauntlet. While it�s easy to dismiss �Bigfoot sightings� and isolated animal attacks, danger follows increased scrutiny. Werewolves already face enough challenges on the hunt.%0a> !!!%25center%25'''Uratha Safal Thil Lu'u'''%0a> !!!!%25center%25''The Uratha Shall Cleave To The Human''%0a> *Uratha mate among themselves and humans. They count humans among their packs, including the Wolf-Blooded. While they feel kinship with wolves, they crave socialization among humans. It grounds them, keeps them in touch with humanity, helps them maintain balance. Werewolves cannot forsake their human sides, lest they become remorseless monsters as selfish as spirits.%0a> %0a> %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> !%25center%25%25werewolf%25'''Tribal Vows'''%25%25%0a> %0a> The Firstborn stand apart from other spirits as the great totems of Uratha tribes. First among the children of Urfarah, the Firstborn exemplify different aspects of Siskur-Dah. They are older siblings and guides to the Forsaken. Their patronage provides knowledge, and tools to hunt specific prey. In turn the tribes honor their totems with vows sworn to the Oath of the Moon in their names. %0a> %0a> !!!%25center%25'''Nu sum ghumur nu su ghid'''-Blood Talon%0a> !!!!%25center%25''Offer No Surrender You Would Not Accept''%0a> *The Blood Talons lead violent lives even for werewolves. They offer no quarter and seek none. Sworn on Fenris-Ur�s name is this oath: to offer no dishonorable surrender, and to accept none from their enemies. Blood Talons stand at the forefront of Uratha conflicts, where baring their throats means worse than death: It means ''weakness''.%0a> !!!%25center%25'''Su a sar-hith sa'''-Bone Shadow%0a> !!!!%25center%25''Pay Each Spirit in Kind''%0a> *Bone Shadows know that their path leads them through darkness, death, and terrible secrets. They stalk the Shadow, hunting the things that would hunt them. Sworn on ''Kamduis-Ur�s'' name is this oath: to pay each spirit with claw and ''gathra'', respect and rage. The Bone Shadows know what horrors await them if the Uratha grow weak.%0a> !!!%25center%25'''Nu mus halhala'''-Hunters in Darkness%0a> !!!!%25center%25''Let No Sacred Place in Your Territory Be Violated''%0a> *Hunters in Darkness hold their territories sacred in a way other tribes don�t understand. It is the land in which the ''Meninna'' are supreme, the apex predators. Theirs is an ancient legacy borne proudly in their savage hearts. Sworn in ''Hikaon-Ur�s'' name is this oath: to never let friend or foe violate the Hunter�s territory unchallenged. The ''Meninna'' shape their ''mus-rahin'' service to the hunt; a violation of that ground is a violation of the Hunter�s very devotion.%0a> !!!%25center%25'''Kul kisura udmeda'''-Iron Master%0a> !!!!%25center%25''Honor Your Territory in All Things''%0a> *The Iron Masters know that change is the only constant. The world tomorrow might only resemble today�s world in passing. The Iron Masters know that they must adapt to the world. They ever search for ways to master their realm. Sworn in ''Sagrim-Ur�s'' name is this oath: to remember that which defines a werewolf even in the face of change.%0a> !!!%25center%25'''Nu si gid namtar'''-Storm Lord%0a> !!!!%25center%25''Allow No One to Witness or to Tend Your Weakness''%0a> *Presence and power mean everything to the Storm Lords. They must stand as giants among their kin. To their enemies and to their rivals alike they show no weakness. To the ''Iminir'' themselves, they ''have'' no weakness. Storm Lords hold themselves to a higher standard, such that when anyone looks upon the face of the Uratha, they see a fearless wolf. Sworn in ''Skolis-Ur�s'' name is this oath: to remain unbreakable in service to the hunt.%0a> %0a

Dr. Fairchild was known for traveling the world in search of useful plants, but he was also an educator and a renowned scientist. At the age of 22, he created the Section of Foreign Seed and Plant Introduction of the United States Department of Agriculture, and for the next 37 years he traveled the world in search of plants of potential use to the American people.  In 1898, David Fairchild established the USDA Plant Introduction Garden in Florida and continued to travel and explore to add to the ever-growing collection.  What the history books leave out, of course, is that David Fairchild was a Ithaeur Bone Shadow, and the travels his team undertook were cover for his packs movements to better study the Hisil and its denizens around the world.%0a%3c %0a%3c Upon his retirement in 1935 Dr. Fairchild returned to Miami with his pack and they joined a group of passionate plant collectors and horticulturists, including retired accountant Col. Robert H. Montgomery (1872-1953), environmentalist Marjory Stoneman Douglas, County Commissioner Charles Crandon and landscape architect William Lyman Phillips. This core group worked tirelessly to bring the idea of a one of a kind botanic garden to life, and in 1938 the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden opened its 83 acres to the public for the first time. Col. Montgomery, who founded the Garden, named it to honor his friend. Many plants still growing in the Garden were collected by Dr. Fairchild, including a giant African baobab tree by the Gate House. In 1940, Dr. Fairchild embarked on the Garden's first official collecting expedition, sailing from the Philippines to the Indonesian archipelago on a special oceangoing Chinese junk called the Cheng Ho. The voyage provided many of the Garden's early botanical specimens before the outbreak of World War II forced the explorers to return home.%0a%3c %0a%3c Dr Fairchild married Marian Hubbard Bell and the pair of them had two children, a son Graham Fairchild, and daughter Nancy Fairchild.

He was elected as Mayor of Miami in 1927 (until 1929), 1933 (until 1935), 1939 (in recall election for 2 months), and lastly 1939 (until his death in 1940).  EG never changed, but he did use his power as mayor to cover up incidents from the shadow. %0a> %0a> EG married a young woman named Lucinda Blackwell who worked in his first store, She was an Iron Master Elodoth.  She was with him every step of the way on his political career, helping him and acting as the perfect Mayor's wife.  She gave him a total of seven children, but only three made it to adulthood.  Only one of the children, a young man named George, changed under the full moon.

G. Sewell Park located at 1801 NW South River Drive.%0a> %0a> From the two brothers, we have the Sewell family.  The Sewell family’s house was one of Miami’s most prominent homes. Halissee Hall was acquired by the University of Miami in 1932 and, over the years, the University of Miami School of Medicine and Jackson Memorial Hospital grew up around the former estate. In 1997, the Medical Faculty Association took the initiative to undertake a complete restoration of this National Historic Register structure. When completed, Halissee will be home to the School of Medicine’s Faculty Club and will host receptions, conferences and lectures – once again, entertaining men and women vital to the growth of Miami and South Florida.%0a> It is known among the family, that there is a series of tunnels under the University of Miami.  That allow the family access to their home on campus.  Some say that both brothers had a hand in building it, as a way to move around in emergencies.

For the economy of central Miami, 1961 was a grim year. In the inner-city area around the Tamiami Trail, more than 1,000 homes with Federal Housing Administration mortgages had been vacated, and many were vandalized for their copper pipe and electrical fixtures. Local shops gasped for customers and went broke; 40-year-old Burdine's, the chief downtown department store, was languishing helplessly as its clientele moved toward the suburbs. Even Miami Beach, the supreme American resort across the Bay of Biscayne, was slipping perceptibly past its prime, as wealthy northern tourists increasingly passed it by for mellower island shores to the south.%0a%3c %0a%3c To many observers, the arrival of the Cubans seemed a deadly blow to the city's hope for recovery. Some 200,000 had already fled Castro's burgeoning dictatorship, and more arrived daily. Castro had proclaimed a new law of potestas patria under which he was abolishing Catholic schools, establishing centers for communist indoctrination, incarcerating dissidents, and commandeering lawyers and other white-collar people for labor in the sugar fields. Refugees flocked the Miami airport in painful confusion then clustered five or more to a room in Miami bungalows and apartments, looking for jobs that didnt exist in the struggling Dade County economy and confidently awaiting deliveranceand vicarious vengeancethrough a brutal charge of US Marines onto the beaches of Cuba, ordered by America's macho new president, John F. Kennedy.%0a%3c %0a%3c Some 13,000 of the immigrants came as unaccompanied children, landing in Miami without kin, a grasp of the English language, and many with only a vague connection in the United States. They had been packed off by desperate parents and left to be processed in refugee camps and then passed on to orphanages and foster homes. Many of the immigrants of all ages were channeled first to other communities, but most of them gravitated back to southern Florida, the area closest to their prior home and most acculturated with Cubans.%0a%3c %0a%3c All statistical projections were dismal. Experts foresaw a prolonged siege of medical crises, economic stresses, and ethnic frictions; a teeming burden of "social disorders," needs for housing, welfare, and simple hygienean impossible load for the already afflicted social services of the city. Here in one economically stagnant urban area, over a period of just two years, thronged some 200,000 penurious immigrantsmore than the total of black unemployed youths in all of America's urban areas at the time, concentrated in the hard core of one central city. It was an influx about one-fifth the size of the entire Dade County population in 1960, an inundation more rapid and overwhelming than any previous migration to one American city.%0a%3c %0a%3c Few of the arrivals spoke English, and virtually none had arranged for jobs or housing. Many had been reasonably well educated and well employed in Cuba, but their experience and credentials were often irrelevant in the United States. Doctors, architects, and lawyers escaped the sugar fields only to work as busboys, bootblacks, and parking-lot attendants. Nearly 60 percent of the exiles had been common laborers even in Cuba, and all had lost most of what they had accumulated at home. From the press coverage and political comment of the day it is difficult to find any observers who saw this human flood as anything but a tribulation for southern Florida or a problem to be solved by saviors at the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and the Immigration and Naturalization Serviceor the US Marines.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Cubans' saviors, however, were already at hand: they would be saved by themselvesnot chiefly by a trickle-down of grants from the government, but by the upsurge of their own productive efforts. They would be saved by people like Jos Palmero, penniless, having invested his last dollars in some second hand records to peddle door to door; by Armando Codina, then a frightened, gangly youth, with just two words of English, hamburger and Coke, assigned to a refugee camp.%0a%3c %0a%3c Armando Cordina settled in among the others in what would soon be called Little Havana.  Armando himself fled for the same reason many of the others did.  While most of them had what folks would consider proper jobs back in Cuba, Armandos skill set lay in the more grey area.  He was, however, very charismatic and used the connections with his family back home to gather other orphans of the crisis under his wing and start a proper trade in the less legal pleasures of life.   They started first with weed in small batches and some cocaine and cigars, later expanding to other narcotics as the market grew.  Armando pressed upon his newfound family that they find legitimate cover jobs to explain where their money came from, however, and most did: gophers, day laborers, sanitation work and child care helped to cover their tracks and offer additional income to the group besides.  %0a%3c %0a%3c Not long after his arrival a local cigar owner, Roy Shapiro, took a chance on Armando and hired the youth at his store Viva Cigar Lounge.  Soon he noticed Armandos abilities with rolling cigars by hand and was quite happy with the money made off the counterfeit Cuban cigars that he and his friends rolled.  Armando put his nose to the grindstone, splitting his time between the store, the business handled by his family and the side business that fueled everything else.  When Roy decided to retire to Palm Springs he sold the store to Armando, trusting the young man to continue the good work he had been doing there.  %0a%3c %0a%3c With the store now in the hands of the Cordina Family they flourished, using the steady supply of Cuban cigars they were able to get in around the embargo to their advantage.  Armando pioneered a near-foolproof technique for cutting some of the actual Cubans with normal cigars, mixing the tobacco within before rerolling and relabeling them to near perfection to increase their stock of the product and adding to their profits.  As far as the public saw, Armando Cordina and his family seemed like a typical success story.  They had come here from Cuba with nothing, and with the successful business plan they opened two more Viva Cigar stores, both in prominent hotels in the area owned by the Sewell family.%0a%3c   %0a%3c In the 80s when another flood of Cubans came to Miami, the familys ranks swelled as many of those whod come over in the 60s asked their families to join them, bringing in more and more connections.  Armando helped send many of the children born in Miami to good schools and on to college using the grey money to fund it.  In return he got well educated young Uratha and blooded to help protect the family, keeping as much as he could in house  With their help he kept up the drug running and was able to bring in new shipment lines from Cuba down into Miami.%0a%3c %0a%3c Armando had already Changed under the Half Moon back in Cuba, leaving behind his pack as they were not able to make the journey himself.  A number of the motley crew that he had assorted upon his arrival was also touched by the Moon, having gone through the Change as well or showed tells of being blooded.  A core part of the now-extended family still maintains this tie to the Urfarah, with the Storm Lords and Iron Masters most prominent.%0a%3c    %0a%3c %0a---%0a> The city did not seem ready for them.

At the age of 22, he created the Section of Foreign Seed and Plant Introduction of the United States Department of Agriculture, and for the next 37 years, he traveled the world in search of plants of potential use to the American people.  In 1898, David Fairchild establishes the USDA Plant Introduction Garden in Florida.  He continued to travel and explore, what the history books leave out is that David Fairchild was a Ithaeur Bone Shadow.  He and his pack traveled not only studying the real world but also the hisil.  %0a%3c Dr. Fairchild retired to Miami in 1935 and joined a group of passionate plant collectors and horticulturists who also happened to be his packmates, including retired accountant Col. Robert H. Montgomery (1872-1953), environmentalist Marjory Stoneman Douglas, County Commissioner Charles Crandon and landscape architect William Lyman Phillips. This core group worked tirelessly to bring the idea of a one of a kind botanic garden to life, and in 1938, Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden opened its 83 acres to the public for the first time.. Col. Montgomery, who founded the Garden, named it to honor his friend. Many plants still growing in the Garden were collected by Dr. Fairchild, including a giant African baobab tree by the Gate House. In 1940, Dr. Fairchild embarked on the Garden's first official collecting expedition, sailing from the Philippines to the Indonesian archipelago on a special oceangoing Chinese junk called the Cheng Ho. The voyage provided many of the Garden's early botanical specimens before the outbreak of World War II forced the explorers to return home.%0a%3c %0a%3c Dr Fairchild married Marian Hubbard Bell, the pair of them had two children, A son Graham Fairchild, and daughter Nancy Fairchild.  The Fairchild family has long roots in New England, United States. They descend from Thomas Fairchild who came from England in 1639 and settled in Stratford, Connecticut, a part of the fledgling New Haven Colony.  Once Dr Fairchild retired, more of the Connecticut Fairchilds moved down to Florida.  Joining them and helping to keep the Botanic Garden open.  Many of them had ties to the Bone Shadow, though some favored Storm Lords as well.  %0a%3c %0a%3c The Family developed a safe place for themselves called Kampong.   It’s located in the Coconut Grove Neighborhood.  Marian’s Sister & her Husband Gilbert Grosvenor bought the property to the north that adjoined Kampong.  After David and Marian passed away, Catherine Sweeney, a second cousin connected to the Fairchild’s bought the property.  Others in the family helped to develop the Pacific Tropical Botanical Garden (now National Tropical Botanical Garden).  They now own the property, though it is still used by all those connected to the Fairchilds.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!%25center%25Other family names: Sweeney, Grosvenor, Bell%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!%25center%25Head of the Family \\%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25'''Aubrey Fairchild(nee Grosvenor)'''  \\%0a%3c %25center%25''Elodoth Tribe'' \\%0a%3c %25center%25'''Bio''':  Wife/Mate to Evan Fairchild.

He was a Irraka belonging to the Iron Masters.  Sewell, working for Henry Flagler, served as foreman and superintendent for the Florida East Coast Railway during the construction of the line from Jacksonville to Miami and later joined the hotel construction department. After helping to construct The Royal Poinciana Hotel and The Breakers Hotel at Palm Beach, Sewell moved to Miami in 1896 to work on the Royal Palm Hotel. While working on the hotel, Sewell stumbled upon the burial grounds of the Tequesta Native-Americans. Sewell gave away some of the skulls as souvenirs, and ordered African-American laborers to move the remaining bones and bury them in a hole, he did this to see if he could provoke some of the local Native American Spirits into showing themselves. . Sewell remained in the employ of the Florida East Coast Railway until 1899, when he left to concentrate his efforts on the mercantile establishment jointly owned with this brother. He was Mayor of the City of Miami from 1903 to 1907.%0a%3c %0a%3c After serving in local politics, Sewell began the construction of his house in 1912. Built on the highest point in the city, the house was named Halissee Hall from the Seminole word meaning "New Moon." He married a young Elodoth named Mary Jones.  Between them having six children. Four made it to adulthood, two of whom first changed to follow in their parents footsteps.%0a%3c %0a%3c Sewell wrote a self-published autobiography entitled John Sewell's Memoirs and History of Miami, Florida. It included an appendix describing his witnessing the attempted assassination of president-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933.

In February 1916, he was elected as president of Miami Chamber of Commerce and was re-elected every year until 1925 (except for 1919). He was elected as Mayor of Miami in 1927 (until 1929), 1933 (until 1935), 1939 (in recall election for 2 months), and lastly 1939 (until his death in 1940).  EG never changed, but he did use his power as mayor to cover up incidents from the shadow. %0a%3c %0a%3c EG married a young woman named Lucinda Blackwell who worked in his first store, She was an Iron Master Elodoth.  She was with him every step of the way on his political career, helping him and acting as the perfect Mayor's wife.  She gave him a total of seven children, but only three made it to adulthood.  Only one of the children, a young man named George, changed under the full moon.

G. Sewell Park located at 1801 NW South River Drive.%0a%3c %0a%3c From the two brothers, we have the Sewell family.  The Sewell family’s house was one of Miami’s most prominent homes. Halissee Hall was acquired by the University of Miami in 1932 and, over the years, the University of Miami School of Medicine and Jackson Memorial Hospital grew up around the former estate. In 1997, the Medical Faculty Association took the initiative to undertake a complete restoration of this National Historic Register structure. When completed, Halissee will be home to the School of Medicine’s Faculty Club and will host receptions, conferences and lectures – once again, entertaining men and women vital to the growth of Miami and South Florida.%0a%3c It is known among the family, that there is a series of tunnels under the University of Miami.

It makes sense that the family would move out to the Western world to make their name bigger. They came overseas ten years before the War of the Four and actively fought against the vampires and the mages. They had a huge advantage being hidden in Portland�s Chinatown, knowing how the Shanghai Tunnels of the city worked. %0a> %0a> The family is known for its connections to the Triad and underground dealings. They are the enforcers and bodyguards for the higher leaders in the world, but some do manage upper-level members once in awhile.%0a> %0a> It wasn�t until the Awakening of one of the main family�s sons happened. At first, they hid him because the mages would steal their son away from them and they would have to fight against him. He was socially inept due to his hiding, but when he came out of hiding and declared he was a mage, the Forsaken were not sure what to do with him since he was apart of their family. Some wanted him dead, others exiled. The connection and a few other events are what caused the Supernatural Alliance to form to the dismay of many.%0a> %0a> Over time though, the Zhang family became pro-UN as their Markus became a head of the Mysterium over time, changing their thoughts towards the pesky mages. Not every member feels comfortable with the Alliance but they accept it and have access to starting to become a family that doesn�t focus on war, but rather knowledge, following Markus� example.%0a> %0a> The head of the family, Zhang Fan is only blooded, but the Chinese family accepts the oldest living member as the head, rather than the strongest.

Immigration usually entails violation of ancestral ties and parental obligations. Dealing in their youths with convulsive change, thrown back on their own devices to create a productive existence, ripped untimely from the womb of a settled life, immigrants everywhere suffer the guilts of disconnection from their homes and families and ally easily with the forces of the future against the claims of the past. Shaped by a fractured or betrayed conservatism, however, the immigrant's most revolutionary creations usually reverberate with remembered values. In forging a new world, he continually restores the old.%0a%3c %0a%3c In the history of the United States, each new flood of immigrants has enacted this essential drama of abandonment and rebuilding. But in recent years, no group has played it out with the energy and resourcefulness of the Cubans who fled Castro's Cuba in rage and fear and settled first in Miami, Florida.%0a%3c %0a%3c The city did not seem ready for them. For the economy of central Miami, 1961 was a grim year. In the inner-city area around the Tamiami Trail, more than 1,000 homes, with Federal Housing Administration mortgages, had been vacated, and many were vandalized for their copper pipe and electrical fixtures. Local shops gasped for customers and went broke; 40-year-old Burdine's, the chief downtown department store, was languishing helplessly as its clientele moved toward the suburbs. Even Miami Beach, the supreme American resort across the Bay of Biscayne, was slipping perceptibly past its prime, as wealthy northern tourists increasingly passed it by for mellower island shores to the south.%0a%3c %0a%3c To many observers, the arrival of the Cubans seemed a deadly blow to the city's hope for recovery. Some 200,000 had already fled Castro's burgeoning dictatorship, and more arrived daily. Castro had proclaimed a new law of potestas patria under which he was abolishing Catholic schools, establishing centers for communist indoctrination, incarcerating dissidents, and commandeering lawyers and other white-collar people for labor in the sugar fields. Refugees flocked the Miami airport, in painful confusion; then clustered five or more to a room in Miami bungalows and apartments, looking for jobs, nonexistent in the struggling Dade County economy, and confidently awaiting deliverance—and vicarious vengeance—through a brutal charge of US Marines onto the beaches of Cuba, ordered by America's macho new president, John F. Kennedy.%0a%3c %0a%3c Some 13,000 of the immigrants came as unaccompanied children, landing in Miami without kin, without English, and many with only a vague connection in the United States. They had been packed off by desperate parents and left to be processed in refugee camps and then passed on to orphanages and foster homes. Many of the immigrants of all ages were channeled first to other communities, but most of them gravitated back to southern Florida, the area closest to their prior home and most acculturated with Cubans.%0a%3c %0a%3c All statistical projections were dismal. Experts foresaw a prolonged siege of medical crises, economic stresses, and ethnic frictions; a teeming burden of "social disorders," needs for housing, welfare, and simple hygiene—an impossible load for the already afflicted social services of the city. Here in one economically stagnant urban area, over a period of just two years, thronged some 200,000 penurious immigrants—more than the total of black unemployed youths in all of America's urban areas at the time, concentrated in the hard core of one central city. It was an influx about one-fifth the size of the entire Dade County population in 1960, an inundation more rapid and overwhelming than any previous migration to one American city.%0a%3c %0a%3c Few of the arrivals spoke English, and virtually none had arranged for jobs or housing. Many had been reasonably well educated and well employed in Cuba, but their experience and credentials were often irrelevant in the United States. Doctors, architects, and lawyers escaped the sugar fields only to work as busboys, bootblacks, and parking-lot attendants. Nearly 60 percent of the exiles had been common laborers even in Cuba, and all had lost most of what they had accumulated at home. From the press coverage and political comment of the day, it is difficult to find any observers who saw this human flood as anything but a tribulation for southern Florida or a problem to be solved by saviors at the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and the Immigration and Naturalization Service—or the US Marines.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Cubans' saviors, however, were already at hand: they would be saved by themselves—not chiefly by a trickle-down of grants from the government, but by the upsurge of their own productive efforts. They would be saved by people like José Palmero, penniless, having invested his last dollars in some second hand records to peddle door to door; by Armando Codina, then a frightened, gangly youth, with just two words of English, hamburger and Coke, assigned to a refugee camp.%0a%3c %0a%3c Armando Cordina settled in among the others in what would soon be called Little Havana.  Armando himself, fled for the same reason many of the others did.  While most of them had what folks would consider proper jobs, back in Cuba, Armando’s skill set lay in the more “grey” area.  He was however, very charismatic.  He started collecting other cuban orphans.  He still had connections back with his “family” back home.   Armando set up himself and his new family, they started first with weed in small batches and some cocaine and cigars.  Then expanded to narcotics as well.  Armando pressed upon the family that they find legitimate cover jobs to explain where their money came from.  Most of them being teenagers, and young adults did simple jobs, cleaning up local businesses, or running errands and packages.  A few worked as day laborers, or looking over children.  %0a%3c %0a%3c Armando had already first changed back in cuba, having to leave his pack and family because there was no way for them to leave.  All of the family he picked out which was a motley sort, had first changed as well or showed tells of being blooded.  A local cigar owner, Roy Shapiro, took a chance on Armando.  He hired the youth at his store Viva Cigar Lounge.  Soon he noticed Armando’s abilities with rolling cigars by hand.  He also made money off the counterfeit Cuban cigars that he and his friends rolled.  After the embargo ban, cuban cigars became a thing of high demand.%0a%3c %0a%3c Armando worked three jobs, running the family the cigar store and the side business that fueled everything else.  He was able to save his cash, and rented an apartment building for everyone to have their own space.  When Roy picked to “retired” to palm springs, he sold the store to Armando.  It showed a great amount of trust on Roy’s part.  Leaving the store to his young employee.  %0a%3c %0a%3c With the store now in the hands of the Cordina Family, they flourished.  Under the table, they sold cubans.  They had a steady supply that came in around the trade embargo,  Armando taught his family how to take some of the actual Cubans, cutting them open and mixing them with real cigars and then rerolling and relabeling them to near perfection.  Doubling their product to sell and tripling their profits.  On the outside, the public face, Armando Cordina and his family seemed like a typical success story.  They had come here from Cuba with nothing, and with the successful business plan, they opened two more Viva Cigar stores, both in prominent hotels in the area, both of them owned by the Sewell family.  %0a%3c In the 80’s when another flood of Cubans came to Miami, their ranks swelled as many of those who’d come over in the 60’s asked their families to join them.  Bringing in more and more connections.  Armando helped send many of the children born in Miami to good schools and on to college.  Using the grey money to fund it.  In return he got well educated young uratha and blooded to help protect the family.  Keeping it in house  With their help he kept it up the drug running, and was able to bring in new shipment lines from Cuba down into Miami.    %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!%25center%25Other family names: Palmero, Oyarzun, Valls%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!%25center%25Head of the Family \\%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25'''NPC'''  \\%0a%3c %25center%25''Moon Tribe'' \\%0a%3c %25center%25'''Bio''':  Info%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Rest of the Family%0a%3c *'''NPC'''%0a%3c **''Tribe & Moon''%0a%3c *'''NPC'''%0a%3c **''Tribe & Moon''%0a%3c *'''NPC '''%0a%3c **''Tribe & Moon''%0a%3c *'''NPC'''%0a%3c **''Tribe & Moon''%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!'''Property''' %0a---%0a> !!!!%25center%25''The D�ambrosio Family'' %0a> %25center%25'''(Embassy Opposition)'''%0a> %0a> The D�Ambrosio family came over from Italy around the same time as the Zhang family. Instead of choosing to be a part of the criminal underworld they first chose to be police officers and city leaders. This didn�t change during the War of the Four, but it put them in a position to enforce police brutality against other supernaturals and try to pass laws to create curfews to restrict vampire movement. The were the biggest threat for the other factions during this war. Killing a leader or a Captain of the police Force would have brought more focus to the city than any supernatural wanted.%0a> %0a> Then the first wave came� the Hunters attacked all four factions which brought the alliance about. Laws that were created were overturned. Several members of the police were forced into retirement, including a dozen members of the family. Even one of the lawmakers of the city had to step down during this time. The family was broken in a year's time.%0a> %0a> They are against the alliance, the same Alliance that broke the family.

Places of spiritual power  that werewolves banded together and protected.  In Werewolf the Forsaken there  are no Caerns. Each pack of werewolves has their own territory usually claimed around a locus.. And no larger than a city block or two.More powerful packs might have larger territory.  Problem arise when two pack but heads over territory. This usually solved by the two packs themselves usually violently, and as long as it doesnt spill out enough to let the humans see what is going on packs are left to sort things out themselves. %0a> %0a> While a protectorate - a group of packs that hold territory over a large amount of land ( usually a city)  Might have an Alpha pack. It is not the Alpha packs responsibility to police all the other packs. They have their own territory to protect. Their own prey to hunt. %0a> %0a> Some packs might want to meet and talk things out. Information might need to be shared, stories told about the things packs have been doing, or things that threaten the protectorate,, and Urratha are social creatures at heart. This is where the concept to a Tur comes from. It is a Neutral area.  Not claimed by any pack. It is not itself a loci. %0a> %0a> Turs are usually places in locations far from where activity might be noticed by the human population, out of the way corners of public parks surrounded by fences.

It defines ''Siskur-Dah'', the legacy of ''Urfarah''. It helps Luna�s shapeshifting brood find its place in a world of animistic duality. Above all, the Oath is a weapon against degeneration into a mindless beast. By the Oath are Forsaken lifted above half-blind humans and mere wolves and spirits. Through it they gain strength, a creed, and an outlet through which to express their dedication. Even the Pure swear a version of the Oath, though each tribe has its own variations, and none of the ''Anshega'' would ever swear it to Luna. Other spirits, those that hate the Forsaken for their role in the death of ''Urfarah'', judge each Pure based on the form of the Oath that he took.  The Oath is a silver chain binding the monster. Yet it also drives those it binds to be better than they are. Mother Luna watches over her children still, and they know it through the presence of Lunes, the mad moon spirits. Lunes judge the Oath, exalting its champions and condemning its transgressors. Each of the Lunes is as bipolar as its mother, and while one might decry a werewolf for not upholding the Oath strongly enough, it might also barely react when she achieves a great success. No one said adhering to a creed of primeval hunters and capricious spirits would ever be easy.%0a%3c %0a%3c Not all punishments come from the Lunes. Werewolves who reject the Oath become lost in the hunt without guidance or support from the Firstborn. Some reject the Oath out of wickedness, and so become little more than cunning beasts who sometimes wear human skin. Ignoring the Oath is a sure way to lose one�s grip on the things that make the Uratha who, rather than what, they are. Without balance, werewolves can become trapped in one form or even one world. In time, they forget even what they once were, becoming as single-minded and inflexible as spirits.%0a%3c %0a%3c Several tenets comprise the Oath. Each tribe (indeed, each pack) places greater importance on some of the laws than it does the others. The added significance is in regard to tribe�s favored prey and its view of a proper world. Some werewolves pay only lip service to one tenet. The more devout take every law as sacred. In the end, not even her packmates can determine how a werewolf approaches the Oath; it is a decision she must make for herself.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> The Oath binds Uratha to a code of savage harmony.

Even the Pure swear a version of the Oath, though each tribe has its own variations, and none of the ''Anshega'' would ever swear it to Luna. Other spirits, those that hate the Forsaken for their role in the death of ''Urfarah'', judge each Pure based on the form of the Oath that he took.  The Oath is a silver chain binding the monster. Yet it also drives those it binds to be better than they are. Mother Luna watches over her children still, and they know it through the presence of Lunes, the mad moon spirits. Lunes judge the Oath, exalting its champions and condemning its transgressors. Each of the Lunes is as bipolar as its mother, and while one might decry a werewolf for not upholding the Oath strongly enough, it might also barely react when she achieves a great success. No one said adhering to a creed of primeval hunters and capricious spirits would ever be easy.%0a> %0a> Not all punishments come from the Lunes. Werewolves who reject the Oath become lost in the hunt without guidance or support from the Firstborn. Some reject the Oath out of wickedness, and so become little more than cunning beasts who sometimes wear human skin. Ignoring the Oath is a sure way to lose ones grip on the things that make the Uratha who, rather than what, they are. Without balance, werewolves can become trapped in one form or even one world. In time, they forget even what they once were, becoming as single-minded and inflexible as spirits.%0a> %0a> Several tenets comprise the Oath. Each tribe (indeed, each pack) places greater importance on some of the laws than it does the others. The added significance is in regard to tribes favored prey and its view of a proper world. Some werewolves pay only lip service to one tenet. The more devout take every law as sacred. In the end, not even her packmates can determine how a werewolf approaches the Oath; it is a decision she must make for herself.%0a> %0a214c254%0a%3c *No werewolf can transgress against this tenet, for it is the beating heart of his existence. The People hunt. They revere Siskur-Dahas their most holy purpose. To them, it is not just a way of life; the hunt is life. It is Father Wolf�s greatest legacy.  Only werewolves can hunt like Urfarahonce did. Every pack has its own rituals of the hunt, as does every Ghost Wolf. Like any religious law, this tenet is a point of contention among rivals and enemies. A pack�s solemn duty is to hunt, whether things of flesh or spirit or both. Failure to do so causes other packs to doubt the pack�s commitment, using it as an excuse (real or feigned) to move on its territory. Bloody clashes under the moon usually follow, threatening the sanctity of the Oath�s next most important clause.%0a---%0a> *No werewolf can transgress against this tenet, for it is the beating heart of his existence.

It is both specific and ambiguous, which of course only adds to the confusion. Most agree the law makes it taboo to kill anyone with the blood of the Wolf except at great need. Many Uratha think of Wolf-Blooded and human pack members as part of the People, and thus their lives are equally sacred.  Nearly as many interpretations of this law exist as there are packs in the world. Open challenges of dominance resulting in accidental death might be considered acceptable to some, while murder of an unaware victim is a heinous crime. Lunes offer little help interpreting the law, their words every bit as contradictory as clashing Forsaken beliefs. Most werewolves assume that beating another werewolf is acceptable within the Oath. Slaying a defeated foe is murder. Killing when unnecessary � whether prey or fellow werewolf � is a sin, especially when the victim is one of your own kind. Elodoth argue with their packs and with one another about whether or not the law includes the Pure Tribes. Some Pure seem to believe that killing Forsaken is taboo, although torture doesn�t violate the law. Likewise, some Forsaken refuse to kill the Pure except when the Pure would murder them, and even then sing their lament to wolf and moon.%0a---%0a> *A subject of many tribal debates and heated blood feuds, this tenet says that murdering other Uratha is a grave sin.

Many humans and spirits feign distaste at the idea, but they, too, abide by hierarchies. The world simply won�t allow equality for everyone, and the Forsaken know it. If the prey is stronger than the pack, the pack must bring it to its level. If one pack is stronger than another, the stronger will wins out. It is the law of the wild. Younger werewolves with heads full of pride rebuke the authority of the elders. They feel the elders enforce this law, or perhaps made it up entirely, simply to wield power. In turn, the elders bear their scars, sing of their bloody glories, and take what they feel is their due. Wise elders know that the second half of the clause demands they show respect for pups and young hunters, and afford their less experienced kin that respect. Even the old and strong can have their throats torn out by angry pups. Attitudes toward this law vary within protectorates. In some, elders are given proper deference both for their ability as hunters and their wisdom as Forsaken. Some grow cruel or brutal. They fall out of balance and meet their ends at the claws of the oppressed. Some keep young werewolves in line when even the Oath can�t always guide them. All respect the Firstborn and the ways that the Forsaken have followed since prehistory. If wise elders know that they should respect the young hunters, then wise pups know to respect the scarred veterans for their knowledge and prowess.%0a---%0a> *Uratha are intimately familiar with dominance and submission.

Werewolves fully know the dangers of imbalance. Their ability to hunt suffers. Their territories fall into decline. They grow weak, as did Urfarahin his final days, and soon meet their ends. Wisdom teaches that werewolves should respect their prey. Strong prey shapes strong predators, and vice versa. It is a precarious balance. A pack that kills callously gains enemies among spirits who see them as cruel barbarians. Indifference to the deaths of animals and spirits leads to losing respect for the hunt itself. A true predator kills out of necessity, not mere desire. Respect your prey, and it in turn respects your place as its predator. Spirits lash out at needlessly vicious werewolves, but those who properly respect the hunt earn the Shadow�s begrudging respect as a necessary part of the natural order. Even the most selfish spirits can recognize the honor and savage nobility of the Uratha.  Some Uratha take this a step further. When one of these werewolves kills a deer, she understands that the animal has given its life that hers can continue. She respects the weight of the act. For most, killing is simply about necessity. Creatures like the Hosts and Claimed must be killed before they kill werewolves in turn. Respecting your prey means respecting the need for werewolves to hunt it. These creatures are deadly monsters in their own right.  Even humans are not exempt from Uratha predation, something which younger werewolves often have difficulty grasping. Humans can be prey, and in many cases must be, though the Oath forbids consumption of human flesh. Older werewolves, and those who quickly take to their roles as the ultimate predators, feel no more remorse for killing humans than they do for any other creature. Merciful werewolves might warn humans off first through various terrifying means. Just as many kill them as readily as they would their next meal.%0a---%0a> ***Humans long ago abandoned this law and suffer for it. Werewolves fully know the dangers of imbalance.

It is a surrender of honor and control, and no meat is sweeter upon the tongue of a hungry werewolf. The rush of power is too much, though. To a werewolf, eating her own kind, or her close kin, is a grave temptation that also drags her closer to the spirit than the flesh.  Forsaken lorekeepers have long wondered at the truth of the matter. This clause is one of the oldest and certainly the clearest. Some Uratha then wonder if the temptation has always existed, deliberately left by the mad moon-goddess or born in Father Wolf�s death at the claws and teeth of his own progeny. Perhaps it is an eternal reminder of that grave act. Whatever its origin, it remains a temptation and a threat to a werewolf�s soul. In the throes of Kuruth, even the most disciplined Uratha might devour her kill and remember the taste through the mists of Rage. No werewolf is safe from this temptation, even those who have never tasted the power of the sweetest meats.%0a---%0a> *The act provides power and pleasure, a rush of Essence and a perverse satisfaction of basest urges.

Younger werewolves laugh at the thought, thinking themselves immortal. This law protects against that headstrong thinking; it was born of a need to protect werewolves, not humans. A large-scale war between humans and werewolves would end badly for the werewolves. Even if the Uratha won a protracted war against their human kin, the results would devastate the world. Cunning werewolves stick to the shadows, hunting at night or across the Gauntlet. While it�s easy to dismiss �Bigfoot sightings� and isolated animal attacks, danger follows increased scrutiny.

Places of spiritual power  that werewolves banded together and protected.  In Werewolf the Forsaken there  are no Caerns. Each pack of werewolves has their own territory usually claimed around a locus.. And no larger than a city block or two.More powerful packs might have larger territory.  Problem arise when two pack but heads over territory. This usually solved by the two packs themselves usually violently, and as long as it doesn&#2013266066;t spill out enough to let the humans see what is going on packs are left to sort things out themselves. %0a%3c %0a%3c While a protectorate - a group of packs that hold territory over a large amount of land ( usually a city)  Might have an Alpha pack. It is not the Alpha packs responsibility to police all the other packs. They have their own territory to protect. Their own prey to hunt. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some packs might want to meet and talk things out. Information might need to be shared, stories told about the things packs have been doing, or things that threaten the protectorate,, and Urratha are social creatures at heart. This is where the concept to a Tur comes from. It is a Neutral area.  Not claimed by any pack. It is not itself a loci. %0a%3c %0a%3c Turs are usually places in locations far from where activity might be noticed by the human population, out of the way corners of public parks surrounded by fences. The  top of mountains that are closed for most of the year because of snow. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Uratha of the City of Portland have two known TURs. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''Forest Park Tur''%0a%3c %0a%3c The first, and best known Tur is in Forest park Tur which is found by  going off the trails of the park.

The springs are within the Cascade Mountains in a heavily forested area at elevation 2280 ft (695 m).[1] The springs are just outside the boundary of Bull of the Woods Wilderness area.. The Springs have been Privately owned  since the early 1990&#2013266066;s  The family that owns the spring are comprised of Wolf blooded, of all different tribes who banded together to buy and protect the land. %0a%3c %0a

Once First Changed, the trial for the member begins and doesn&#2013266066;t end until one of two things happen: they become Thrice-born or they quit and the Hayes family head exiles them from the family and cuts them the money flow, contacts, allies, and family Locus.%0a%3c %0a%3c This does not mean they will not help the Uratha with their issues. The Hayes family and other Thrice-Born will be the first to offer assistance to any pack that asks for their help as long is it does not harm another Uratha.

If any other method can work, Thrice Born will try that direction first.) %0a%3c %0a%3c Family members who have undergone the First Change usually join the Hunters in Darkness for protecting the land and all its inhabitants is the most important thing to the family. This is not required as Blood Talons, Bone Shadows are needed to fight threats from spirits against the family.

It makes sense that the family would move out to the Western world to make their name bigger. They came overseas ten years before the War of the Four and actively fought against the vampires and the mages. They had a huge advantage being hidden in Portlands Chinatown, knowing how the Shanghai Tunnels of the city worked. %0a%3c %0a%3c The family is known for its connections to the Triad and underground dealings. They are the enforcers and bodyguards for the higher leaders in the world, but some do manage upper-level members once in awhile.%0a%3c %0a%3c It wasnt until the Awakening of one of the main familys sons happened. At first, they hid him because the mages would steal their son away from them and they would have to fight against him. He was socially inept due to his hiding, but when he came out of hiding and declared he was a mage, the Forsaken were not sure what to do with him since he was apart of their family. Some wanted him dead, others exiled. The connection and a few other events are what caused the Supernatural Alliance to form to the dismay of many.%0a%3c %0a%3c Over time though, the Zhang family became pro-UN as their Markus became a head of the Mysterium over time, changing their thoughts towards the pesky mages. Not every member feels comfortable with the Alliance but they accept it and have access to starting to become a family that doesnt focus on war, but rather knowledge, following Markus example.%0a%3c %0a%3c The head of the family, Zhang Fan is only blooded, but the Chinese family accepts the oldest living member as the head, rather than the strongest. Fan never First changed and was protected during the war of the four where many of the families Forsaken had died. Slowly, the 95%25 wolf-blooded family had more first changes and have restored a formidable amount of Uratha up to about 10%25 Uratha at the current day. Markus is currently the mages spokesperson for the family and to this day, the only member of the family that has Awakened. %0a%3c %0a%3c The familys Uratha at first were about seventy-five percent Blood Talons. While this has changed over the last three decades, with more Storm Lords and Iron Masters taking place in the family, the Blood Talons are still most of the chosen Tribe of the family. Still, the Hunters in Darkness and Bone Shadows, even Ghost Wolves, have their place in the family.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25Head of Family \\%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25'''Zhang Fan''' (84) \\%0a%3c %25center%25''Wolf-blooded'' \\%0a%3c %25center%25'''Personality''': Resilient, Stern, Strict, super happy when drunk \\%0a%3c %25center%25'''Story Hooks''': Fan definitely has connections to the Triad and is seen as an important member in the Triad. He has more pull in the criminal sphere than most in the city due to sixty years in the city.%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''The Dambrosio Family'' %0a%3c %25center%25'''(Embassy Opposition)'''%0a%3c %0a%3c The DAmbrosio family came over from Italy around the same time as the Zhang family. Instead of choosing to be a part of the criminal underworld they first chose to be police officers and city leaders. This didnt change during the War of the Four, but it put them in a position to enforce police brutality against other supernaturals and try to pass laws to create curfews to restrict vampire movement. The were the biggest threat for the other factions during this war. Killing a leader or a Captain of the police Force would have brought more focus to the city than any supernatural wanted.%0a%3c %0a%3c Then the first wave came the Hunters attacked all four factions which brought the alliance about. Laws that were created were overturned. Several members of the police were forced into retirement, including a dozen members of the family. Even one of the lawmakers of the city had to step down during this time. The family was broken in a year's time.%0a%3c %0a%3c They are against the alliance, the same Alliance that broke the family. Even when the UN offers help, they refuse. Pride is a huge factor, but there is another reason. The family believes the Shadow has become abstract and peculiar. Light Spirits having Darkness Influence and Tree Spirits have Fire based Numina. The DAmbrosios believe this was caused by the Supernatural alliance as the spirits have gotten more confusing with how they work in recent years. They want to bring the Shadow back to its original state with Water Spirits influencing water, not electricity.%0a%3c %0a%3c Members of the family that First change have recently become more focused on being Bone Shadows as they want to give Spirits their original forms back to them. This has taken over the majority being Storm Lords and Iron Masters in recent years, but both are still prevalent.%0a%3c %0a%3c The family no longer holds major political positions or important city jobs. In fact, they have had trouble with getting important jobs in the city. When the richest family member brings in 40K a year, you know they have fallen on hard times. If they asked for help, this would be the case, but family pride is too important. The DAmbrosios want to make a name for themselves again, but not with a cost so steep as to accept help from the UN.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25Head of Family%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25'''Melody Annette DAmbrosio -MAD-''' (38) \\%0a%3c %25center%25''Rahu Bone Shadow'' \\%0a%3c %25center%25'''Personality''': Bitchy, Vindictive, Catty \\%0a%3c %25center%25'''Story Hook''': Thankfully she focuses on the spirits more than the familys fall from grace. She hunts the dangerous spirits and tries to remake the abstracts and broken spirits whole again. Underneath that bitch of a shell, there is a soft spot for those who are broken.%0a

They hunt to survive. They feel the rush of blood in their veins and from the open wounds of their prey. Death intertwines with life, and fury with joy. Bound not by human authority or morality, they are monsters who hunt monsters. Without a guiding purpose, many would descend into atavistic madness.

Ignoring the Oath is a sure way to lose one&#2013266066;s grip on the things that make the Uratha who, rather than what, they are. Without balance, werewolves can become trapped in one form or even one world. In time, they forget even what they once were, becoming as single-minded and inflexible as spirits.%0a%3c %0a%3c Several tenets comprise the Oath. Each tribe (indeed, each pack) places greater importance on some of the laws than it does the others. The added significance is in regard to tribe&#2013266066;s favored prey and its view of a proper world. Some werewolves pay only lip service to one tenet. The more devout take every law as sacred. In the end, not even her packmates can determine how a werewolf approaches the Oath; it is a decision she must make for herself.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''Urum Da Takus'''%0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''The Wolf Must Hunt''%0a%3c *No werewolf can transgress against this tenet, for it is the beating heart of his existence. The People hunt. They revere Siskur-Dahas their most holy purpose. To them, it is not just a way of life; the hunt is life. It is Father Wolf&#2013266066;s greatest legacy.  Only werewolves can hunt like Urfarahonce did. Every pack has its own rituals of the hunt, as does every Ghost Wolf. Like any religious law, this tenet is a point of contention among rivals and enemies. A pack&#2013266066;s solemn duty is to hunt, whether things of flesh or spirit or both. Failure to do so causes other packs to doubt the pack&#2013266066;s commitment, using it as an excuse (real or feigned) to move on its territory. Bloody clashes under the moon usually follow, threatening the sanctity of the Oath&#2013266066;s next most important clause.%0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''Imru Nu Fir Imru'''%0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''The People Do Not Murder The People''%0a%3c *A subject of many tribal debates and heated blood feuds, this tenet says that murdering other Uratha is a grave sin. It is both specific and ambiguous, which of course only adds to the confusion. Most agree the law makes it taboo to kill anyone with the blood of the Wolf except at great need. Many Uratha think of Wolf-Blooded and human pack members as part of the People, and thus their lives are equally sacred.  Nearly as many interpretations of this law exist as there are packs in the world. Open challenges of dominance resulting in accidental death might be considered acceptable to some, while murder of an unaware victim is a heinous crime. Lunes offer little help interpreting the law, their words every bit as contradictory as clashing Forsaken beliefs. Most werewolves assume that beating another werewolf is acceptable within the Oath. Slaying a defeated foe is murder. Killing when unnecessary  whether prey or fellow werewolf  is a sin, especially when the victim is one of your own kind. Elodoth argue with their packs and with one another about whether or not the law includes the Pure Tribes. Some Pure seem to believe that killing Forsaken is taboo, although torture doesnt violate the law. Likewise, some Forsaken refuse to kill the Pure except when the Pure would murder them, and even then sing their lament to wolf and moon.%0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''Sih Sehe Mak; Mak Ne Sih'''%0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''The Low Honor The High; The High Respect The Low''%0a%3c *Uratha are intimately familiar with dominance and submission. Many humans and spirits feign distaste at the idea, but they, too, abide by hierarchies. The world simply wont allow equality for everyone, and the Forsaken know it. If the prey is stronger than the pack, the pack must bring it to its level. If one pack is stronger than another, the stronger will wins out. It is the law of the wild. Younger werewolves with heads full of pride rebuke the authority of the elders. They feel the elders enforce this law, or perhaps made it up entirely, simply to wield power. In turn, the elders bear their scars, sing of their bloody glories, and take what they feel is their due. Wise elders know that the second half of the clause demands they show respect for pups and young hunters, and afford their less experienced kin that respect. Even the old and strong can have their throats torn out by angry pups. Attitudes toward this law vary within protectorates. In some, elders are given proper deference both for their ability as hunters and their wisdom as Forsaken. Some grow cruel or brutal. They fall out of balance and meet their ends at the claws of the oppressed. Some keep young werewolves in line when even the Oath cant always guide them. All respect the Firstborn and the ways that the Forsaken have followed since prehistory. If wise elders know that they should respect the young hunters, then wise pups know to respect the scarred veterans for their knowledge and prowess.%0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''Ni Daha'''%0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''Respect You Prey''%0a%3c ***Humans long ago abandoned this law and suffer for it. Werewolves fully know the dangers of imbalance. Their ability to hunt suffers. Their territories fall into decline. They grow weak, as did Urfarahin his final days, and soon meet their ends. Wisdom teaches that werewolves should respect their prey. Strong prey shapes strong predators, and vice versa. It is a precarious balance. A pack that kills callously gains enemies among spirits who see them as cruel barbarians. Indifference to the deaths of animals and spirits leads to losing respect for the hunt itself. A true predator kills out of necessity, not mere desire. Respect your prey, and it in turn respects your place as its predator. Spirits lash out at needlessly vicious werewolves, but those who properly respect the hunt earn the Shadows begrudging respect as a necessary part of the natural order. Even the most selfish spirits can recognize the honor and savage nobility of the Uratha.  Some Uratha take this a step further. When one of these werewolves kills a deer, she understands that the animal has given its life that hers can continue. She respects the weight of the act. For most, killing is simply about necessity. Creatures like the Hosts and Claimed must be killed before they kill werewolves in turn. Respecting your prey means respecting the need for werewolves to hunt it. These creatures are deadly monsters in their own right.  Even humans are not exempt from Uratha predation, something which younger werewolves often have difficulty grasping. Humans can be prey, and in many cases must be, though the Oath forbids consumption of human flesh. Older werewolves, and those who quickly take to their roles as the ultimate predators, feel no more remorse for killing humans than they do for any other creature. Merciful werewolves might warn humans off first through various terrifying means. Just as many kill them as readily as they would their next meal.%0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''Nu Hu Uzuz Eren'''%0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''Do Not Eat The Flesh Of Man Or Wolf''%0a%3c *The act provides power and pleasure, a rush of Essence and a perverse satisfaction of basest urges. It is a surrender of honor and control, and no meat is sweeter upon the tongue of a hungry werewolf. The rush of power is too much, though. To a werewolf, eating her own kind, or her close kin, is a grave temptation that also drags her closer to the spirit than the flesh.  Forsaken lorekeepers have long wondered at the truth of the matter. This clause is one of the oldest and certainly the clearest. Some Uratha then wonder if the temptation has always existed, deliberately left by the mad moon-goddess or born in Father Wolfs death at the claws and teeth of his own progeny. Perhaps it is an eternal reminder of that grave act. Whatever its origin, it remains a temptation and a threat to a werewolfs soul. In the throes of Kuruth, even the most disciplined Uratha might devour her kill and remember the taste through the mists of Rage. No werewolf is safe from this temptation, even those who have never tasted the power of the sweetest meats.%0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''Nu Bath Githul'''%0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''The Herd Must Not Know''%0a%3c *Werewolves are mightier than any human, but not invincible. Angry, determined humans threaten even a pack. %0a%3c Guns and bombs quickly even up the score, and those few hunters capable of standing against the Uratha know some of their weaknesses. Younger werewolves laugh at the thought, thinking themselves immortal. This law protects against that headstrong thinking; it was born of a need to protect werewolves, not humans. A large-scale war between humans and werewolves would end badly for the werewolves. Even if the Uratha won a protracted war against their human kin, the results would devastate the world. Cunning werewolves stick to the shadows, hunting at night or across the Gauntlet. While its easy to dismiss Bigfoot sightings and isolated animal attacks, danger follows increased scrutiny. Werewolves already face enough challenges on the hunt.%0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''Uratha Safal Thil Lu'u'''%0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''The Uratha Shall Cleave To The Human''%0a%3c *Uratha mate among themselves and humans. They count humans among their packs, including the Wolf-Blooded. While they feel kinship with wolves, they crave socialization among humans. It grounds them, keeps them in touch with humanity, helps them maintain balance. Werewolves cannot forsake their human sides, lest they become remorseless monsters as selfish as spirits.%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !%25center%25'''Tribal Vows'''%0a%3c %0a%3c The Firstborn stand apart from other spirits as the great totems of Uratha tribes. First among the children of Urfarah, the Firstborn exemplify different aspects of Siskur-Dah. They are older siblings and guides to the Forsaken. Their patronage provides knowledge, and tools to hunt specific prey. In turn the tribes honor their totems with vows sworn to the Oath of the Moon in their names. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''Nu sum ghumur nu su ghid'''-Blood Talon%0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''Offer No Surrender You Would Not Accept''%0a%3c *The Blood Talons lead violent lives even for werewolves. They offer no quarter and seek none. Sworn on Fenris-Urs name is this oath: to offer no dishonorable surrender, and to accept none from their enemies. Blood Talons stand at the forefront of Uratha conflicts, where baring their throats means worse than death: It means ''weakness''.%0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''Su a sar-hith sa'''-Bone Shadow%0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''Pay Each Spirit in Kind''%0a%3c *Bone Shadows know that their path leads them through darkness, death, and terrible secrets. They stalk the Shadow, hunting the things that would hunt them. Sworn on ''Kamduis-Urs'' name is this oath: to pay each spirit with claw and ''gathra'', respect and rage. The Bone Shadows know what horrors await them if the Uratha grow weak.%0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''Nu mus halhala'''-Hunters in Darkness%0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''Let No Sacred Place in Your Territory Be Violated''%0a%3c *Hunters in Darkness hold their territories sacred in a way other tribes dont understand. It is the land in which the ''Meninna'' are supreme, the apex predators. Theirs is an ancient legacy borne proudly in their savage hearts. Sworn in ''Hikaon-Urs'' name is this oath: to never let friend or foe violate the Hunters territory unchallenged. The ''Meninna'' shape their ''mus-rahin'' service to the hunt; a violation of that ground is a violation of the Hunters very devotion.%0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''Kul kisura udmeda'''-Iron Master%0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''Honor Your Territory in All Things''%0a%3c *The Iron Masters know that change is the only constant. The world tomorrow might only resemble todays world in passing. The Iron Masters know that they must adapt to the world. They ever search for ways to master their realm. Sworn in ''Sagrim-Urs'' name is this oath: to remember that which defines a werewolf even in the face of change.%0a%3c !!!%25center%25'''Nu si gid namtar'''-Storm Lord%0a%3c !!!!%25center%25''Allow No One to Witness or to Tend Your Weakness''%0a%3c *Presence and power mean everything to the Storm Lords. They must stand as giants among their kin. To their enemies and to their rivals alike they show no weakness. To the ''Iminir'' themselves, they ''have'' no weakness. Storm Lords hold themselves to a higher standard, such that when anyone looks upon the face of the Uratha, they see a fearless wolf. Sworn in ''Skolis-Urs'' name is this oath: to remain unbreakable in service to the hunt.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> !%25center%25'''The Oaths of the Moon '''%0a> %0a> *test%0a> *test%0a> **test%0a> **test%0a> ***test%0a> *test%0a> %0a
