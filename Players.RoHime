Her once hazel eyes are now vibrant pink and magenta. Her skin is just as pale but filled with the subtle light of smoldering embers just beneath which influences her natural scent to be something akin to burning exotic woods. Swirling, non symmetrical flame like symbols mark her body in various places such as her side, thighs, arms, and under one eye. In the center of her chest, embedded in her sternum, is a large pink gem that glows softly with light at times. There's an otherworldly strangeness to her in the way she walks, talks, or even looks: the aspects of the others.

She still is very new to supernatural life.  She&rsquo;s learned much but still it&rsquo;s only a drop in an ocean of new information.%0a> * '''The Dancer''' - She managed to get a job as an erotic dancer at a local club called The Special Hell. It’s fun work and the money is good.  She works there quite a bit providing for her and her sister.%0a> * '''The Helles Belle''' - She's the newest member of the infamous band and ready to carry on their legacy one monster summon at a time.  She'll sing and play on her amazing fiery guitar with all her heart and fury.%0a> * '''The Immigrant''' - Ryuko, along with her twin, are 3rd generation japanese-americans who greatly enjoy and value their heritage.%0a> * '''Grand Warden of the Eldritch Forest''' - In that life she left behind she was nobility, second only to the Queen of that cursed place.  She carried out her Queen's law, claimed what her Queen wanted, found new playthings, or helped the huntsman do their dark deeds.  Maybe you've seen her when she was a warden?  Her noble upbringing shows still though, her posture is perfect, she eats delicately, and the way she moves is graceful.%0a> * '''The Herald''' - Ryuko is an adept of the Heralds of the Void.  Perhaps you&rsquo;re part of them or interested in joining?%0a> * '''The Sweet Spell''' - Ryuko is the proud owner of [[Portland's only Maid Cafe]].  Odd for someone who can't cook at all.%0a> * '''The Emissary to the Kindred''' - Once, she was exiled from the freehold.  Now, she's the emissary of the Lost to the Kindred community.  Her connections to both groups run deep.%0a> %0a> https://i.imgur.com/9PBTQDB.png %25center%25%0a> %0a> :'''Telekinesis''':She's a potent telekinetic and is often using it subtly.%0a> :'''Legendary Language''':She can understand and speak just about any language with this. It sounds ancient and strange but anyone hearing automatically understands her.%0a> :'''Cloak of the Elements''':She can wreathe herself in the elements of fire, air, blood, and void. %0a> :'''Control Elements''':She's formed pacts with the elements of fire, earth, wind, water, blood, and void.%0a> :'''Goblin Vows''':The power of ghost stories and fresh blood are very much part of her own.%0a> :'''Boon of the Scuttling Spider''':It's rare but she can walk up the side of a building or sit on the ceiling of a room. %0a> :'''Changeling Fate''':Need a bonus to an action? Ryu can give you a +2 if you like!%0a> :'''Third Pillar''':Ryuko is a devoted fire elemental and often will happily let magic flow through her to aid someone's own magic. Feel free to ask for a boost.%0a> :'''Vainglory''':She can bend the mask to reveal her true form but without most of the side effects. Mortal can't hurt her like this. The mind can be changed so easily this way.%0a> :'''Pathfinder''':Once she used this to help her bring stolen or escaped people back to arcadia. Now she uses it to find trifles for her friends.%0a> :'''Unity of Purpose''':Ryuko is deeply bonded with the other members of the cult. This affords her a multitude of wild powers.%0a> :'''Phantom Glory''':Ryuko can ascend to a higher plane and become incorporeal or allow her inner fires to bloom fourth.%0a> :'''Wings of the Void Angel''':Ryuko can manifest blackened feathery wings with burning edges that spread out to thirty feet in total.%0a> :'''Nights Subtle Distractions''':Fire and Shadow will always dance together in the night.%0a> %0a> https://i.imgur.com/aGBRfiy.png %25center%25%0a> %0a> (:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a> %0a> (:cellnr width=360px:) %25lfloat width=150%25 https://i.imgur.com/6DRhZta.jpg%0a> [[Enter Link | Enter Name]]\\%0a> %25white%25 [Enter Description Here]%0a> %0a> (:cell width=360px:) %25lfloat width=150%25 https://i.imgur.com/6DRhZta.jpg%0a> [[Enter Link | Enter Name]]\\%0a> %25white%25 [Enter Description Here]%0a> %0a> (:cellnr width=360px:) %25lfloat width=150%25 https://i.imgur.com/6DRhZta.jpg%0a> [[Enter Link | Enter Name]]\\%0a> %25white%25 [Enter Description Here]%0a> %0a> (:cell width=360px:) %25lfloat width=150%25 https://i.imgur.com/6DRhZta.jpg%0a> [[Enter Link | Enter Name]]\\%0a> %25white%25 [Enter Description Here]%0a> %0a> (:cellnr width=360px:) %25lfloat width=150%25 https://i.imgur.com/6DRhZta.jpg%0a> [[Enter Link | Enter Name]]\\%0a> %25white%25 [Enter Description Here]%0a> %0a> (:cell width=360px:) %25lfloat width=150%25 https://i.imgur.com/6DRhZta.jpg%0a> [[Enter Link | Enter Name]]\\%0a> %25white%25 [Enter Description Here]%0a> %0a> (:cellnr width=360px:) %25lfloat width=150%25 https://i.imgur.com/6DRhZta.jpg%0a> [[Enter Link | Enter Name]]\\%0a> %25white%25 [Enter Description Here]%0a> %0a> (:cell width=360px:) %25lfloat width=150%25 https://i.imgur.com/6DRhZta.jpg%0a> [[Enter Link | Enter Name]]\\%0a> %25white%25 [Enter Description Here]%0a> %0a> (:tableend:)%0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %3cimg title="" alt="" src="http://www.china-cart.com/u/153/18235615/Asian_Peacock_Princess_Feather_Costumes_Full_Set.jpg"> %25center%25%0a

She also has a varied wardrobe for her work outfits: everything from sweet and sexy outfits to submissive leather. She has a few gothic or punk outfits also but this part of her wardrobe is growing now that she&rsquo;s met so many who enjoy the culture. Recently she&rsquo;s become interested in lolita fashion.''%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c https://i.imgur.com/3PZAQpM.png %25center%25%0a%3c %0a%3c ''Her fellow changelings and those touched by the fae see her quite differently. Her long hair is vibrant pink fire that shifts into orange flickers of flame at the tips: eventually fading away like mist similar to a lithium or strontium fire. Her once hazel eyes are now vibrant pink and magenta. Her skin is just as pale but filled with the subtle light of smoldering embers just beneath which influences her natural scent to be something akin to burning exotic woods. Swirling, non symmetrical flame like symbols mark her body in various places such as her side, thighs, arms, and under one eye. In the center of her chest, embedded in her sternum, is a large pink gem that glows softly with light at times. There's an otherworldly strangeness to her in the way she walks, talks, or even looks: the aspects of the others. Most obviously this manifests in her pointed ears and her chaotic personality.''%0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=right border='2px solid #008000' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=450px height=500px%25 https://i.imgur.com/SqbjYGH.png%0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=left border='2px solid #008000' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=450px height=500px%25 https://i.imgur.com/HSSPoxF.png%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c https://i.imgur.com/Kg6xzkc.png %25center%25%0a%3c %0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #008000' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=450px height=500px%25 https://i.imgur.com/lM9yrQR.png%0a%3c %0a%3c * '''The Newcomer''' - While Ryuko arrived in Portland in Mid January of 2017 and only escaped a few weeks prior.
