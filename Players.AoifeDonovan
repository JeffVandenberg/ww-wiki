Almost like she is trying to make herself smaller then she already is, wanting to be unnoticed or overlooked. %0a%0aShe typically wears clothing in darker shades; blue, purple, grey, black. And her clothing looks second hand, sometimes a tear or rip in them, and often a little dirty with paint splatter, or charcoal, chalk, and the like. Her clothes almost always cover her arms and legs fully, all the way down to wrists, and ankles. Nothing very revealing. Aoife's hair is usually left loose, or braided.%0a%0aAnd she is always carrying a rather large hobo style bag, that is filled with various items.
