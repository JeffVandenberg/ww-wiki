His clothes are mostly old and worn, things that look like they would fit comfortably in a fight. He wears jewelry around his neck and a ring on one hand, his eyes are hungry but hint at a primal intelligence, like he's sizing up his prey. Most of his upper torso is covered in tattoos from various times, a collection of history that he keeps on his body like scars. Often, he can be seen with shades and his hair, while usually kept as dreads, can also be seen cut short when it suits him.%0a%0a'+%25vampire%25The Beast+' \\%0aLike most masters of Protean, Mustang has a number of forms he can rely on. His primary form for when things get ugly is an extremely large grizzly bear, rippling muscles, huge teeth and claws, the beast looks like something primordial. For tracking, he's seen as a medium sized white wolf, or in the city he takes the form of a large German Shepard. When things really turn for the worst, he takes on the form of a swarm of flesh eating beetles, monstrous creatures that can shred a man to bone in moments. %0a%0a%25center%25 http://livedoor.4.blogimg.jp/kinisoku/imgs/7/0/70897a55.gif%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25vampire%25Contacts%0a%0a||! %25vampire%25Image ||! %25vampire%25Name ||! %25vampire%25Relationship ||! %25vampire%25Comment ||! %25vampire%25Ringtone ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://junehunterimages.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/raven-looks-down.jpg || %25vampire%25Poe || %25vampire%25Ghoul || %25vampire%25Mustangs faithful sidekick.
