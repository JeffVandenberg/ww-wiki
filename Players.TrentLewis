He can be pretty expensive, but on occasion will take on a client pro-bono or quid-pro-quo. He tailors his services to the client and can range to spiritual advice and remedies, to practical job or relationship advice. Group sessions are available. Also available for corporate events and parties!%0a%0a!!!!%25werewolf%25 ''That Resonates With Me (Werewolves)'': %0aTrent's affinity with the Hisil is strong enough that he can deliberately alter resonance. Loci are prized boons to a territory, but not everyone wants or is able to put in the work and time it takes to change the resonance into something more beneficial to the territory.  %0a%0a!!!!%25werewolf%25 ''Justice for All (All)'': %0aTrent has a particular love for social justice and reform. He is willing to speak publicly about his passion or to call in any particular favors he may have to get things done, as long as he actually supports the initiative. Closing down a neighborhood staple, gentrification, education reform, zoning changes that negatively impact communities are all issues he might lend his voice to.%0a%0a!!!!%25werewolf%25 ''The Wolf Must Hunt (All)'':%0aTrent loves to network. Meeting new people, going new places. All ultimately serve his oath to hunt the most dangerous game. He needs allies, he needs favors, and he needs access. And like any true wolf in sheep's clothing, he is relatively easy-going and ready to have a good time.  %0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a(:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a%0a(:cellnr width=100%25:)%0a!!%25center%25%25werewolf%25'''Quotes'''%0a%0a%25werewolf%25 "We both like to help people and in this world it's rare to find a kindred soul like that."
