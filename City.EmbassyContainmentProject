Currently, this is made up of several central 'viewing areas', research labs, cells, libraries and other data storage, 'veterinary' rooms, material storage areas, and a few dedicated habitats for the first creatures that have been brought here. %0a\\\\%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25%25color=#add8e6%25'''NOTE:'''%25%25%0aAnti-Embassy/Anti-Accord individuals are not given even basic access to this area; the elevator will simply not travel there for them, and if they try to force their way in the Wards deal with them normally.%0a%0a(:tableend:)   %0a%0a%0a(:table valign=top:)%0a(:cellnr width=700 colspan=2 align=left:)%0a%0a!! %25center%25%25color=#add8e6%25 '''Details'''%25%25%0a%0aThe first area you come into is the main 'viewing room', wherein a large number of various screens, arranged carefully along the walls behind protected glass, can be seen, which peer into just about each and every non-classified cell, and in more than one location in some cases (for larger enclosures). Only those with proper clearance can adjust these images, but they'll inherently respond to the voice commands of those that do have it, zooming in, panning the cameras, or otherwise adjusting as needed. Note that these don't work off the voice recognition directly; entering even the main area requires a hand scan which involves a bit of a DNA sample, and the Embassy Wards will inherently shunt anyone out utilizing any sort of magics to shift or conceal these details when entering the area. %0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='1px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=25px margin-right=25px width=300px height=300px%25https://img00.deviantart.net/7a0e/i/2014/061/4/3/steampunk_door_by_bmacsmith-d78kvfx.jpg%0a%0aBranching off from here are several hallways, the motifs of which seem to shift subtly depending on the habitats and enclosures, or other services, one is heading towards. The wing that leads into the research labs, for instance, has a sort of clean, metallic look to it, while those leading to the Shadow Cat enclosures (see below) start to look stony and cave-like. %0a%0aThe further out one gets, the more security clearance one needs, with reinforced metal doors blocking the way (which have an ephemeral and immaterial presence, like the walls/floors/ceiling, blocking any twilight or other incorporeal forms from getting through), which open with scanners/DNA-samplers akin to the one needed to get inside in the first place, for those with the proper clearance.%0a%0a\\%0a%0a!!!%25center%25Research Labs%0a%0a(TBA)%0a%0a!!!%25center%25Libraries/Archives%0a%0a(TBA)%0a%0a!!!%25center%25Medical Area%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=25px margin-right=25px width=250px height=250px%25https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NV9w6RS8yB8/maxresdefault.jpg %0a\\\\\\\\\\%0a(TBA)%0a%0a!!!%25center%25Secure Viewing Rooms%0a%0a(TBA)%0a%0a!!!%25center%25Low Security Enclosures%0a%0a(TBA)%0a%0a!!!%25center%25Storage%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='1px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=25px margin-right=25px width=300px height=300px%25https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ac/da/a8/acdaa855a66581a70077f33bdfb9783b.jpg%0a\\\\\\\\\\%0a(TBA)%0a%0a!! %25center%25''Security Clearances''%0a%0aThere are 5 different tiers of Security clearance for getting access to the various specimens and objects kept here. %0a%0a!!!Contributor (Level 1 Clearance)%0a%0aThe 'basic' level that most can gain access to with a simple talk with Daniel or those of at least Researcher ranking, Contributors are those trusted to be in the area unescorted, and they have access to basic research materials, the viewing room, and the low security cells, where they can leave and return to 'safe' sorts of specimens.%0a%0a(Must have Status 1 (Embassy) or greater and not be recognized as having Anti-Accord sympathies.

They've proven basic capabilities and prudence, and so are trusted with greater access to the facilities.%0a%0aRecovery teams are those dedicated to identifying and recovering potentially dangerous specimens from within the City for storage and research in the ECP. They have access to the 'generic' cells and can put in requests for more specialized holding areas when they've identified threats. Generally, they'll work under a Team Leader if one's available, but they're capable of being sent out on their own.%0a%0a(Those with this level of clearance may put in for Status 2 (Embassy) if they don't have it already)%0a%0aCurrent Individuals at this level:%0a*[[Players.Deirdre Anderson |Deirdre Anderson]] (General Assistant)%0a*[[Players.Laura Renatus |Laura Renatus]] (Research Assistant)%0a*[[Players.MarjaEmergenceJovanovic|Marja Jovanovic]] (Regis' Assistant)%0a*[[Players.AdrianZsolt|Adrian Zsolt]] (Recovery Team)%0a*[[Players.BobbiJoKinslayerCaine|Bobbi Jo]] (Recovery Team)%0a*[[Players.SamuelCaine|Samuel Caine]] (Recovery Team)%0a*[[Players.SophieDawson |Sophie Dawson]] (Recovery Team)%0a%0a%0a!!!Researcher / Team Leader (Level 3 Clearance)%0a%0aResearchers are those that have a proven record among their faction or the embassy of having a keen mind and an eye for Research, Development, and Identification of strange phenomena, and have been granted permissions accordingly by the Curator. They have a far greater level of independence and access to some of the more secure areas of the Facility, as well as the more dangerous creatures kept there. %0a%0aTeam Leaders are those trusted to identify the need for Recovery Teams on their own, with access to the materials and supplies the facility provides for such things, and the ability to put those teams together, sending them out or leading them directly.

They're capable of directing anyone of lower ranking, and are trusted with the studies of just about any creature or object kept within. On a temporary basis, they may even grant temporary clearance to Researchers or their own Assistants, to single areas at a time. %0a%0a(Those at this level may put in for Status (Embassy) 3)%0a%0aCurrent Individuals at this level:%0a*%0a%0a!!!Curator / Ambassadors (Level 5 Clearance)%0a%0aOnly the Curator and the Ambassadors have access to the facilities at this level. Generally, the only special clearance they have over the Head Researchers is the ability to decide on any facility modifications; all such requests go through the Curator (The Ambassadors may do so without his intervention, but others will be pointed to Daniel).

Awakened Magic is maintained over the area, and infused into specialized fabricated creatures the specimens hunt down and feed on. On the 'border' of the cell, surrounding it on all sides, in between the inner and outer walls of the enclosure, is a thin area flooded with incredibly bright lights, to keep the creatures from escaping (although the cell itself has a Twilight presence, it's for good measure). %0a%0a!!!!Capabilities%0a%0aThe creatures are capable of existing in an ephemeral state when not in the presence of bright light, are naturally combat-capable, and are able to absorb Supernal (ie Mage) Magic. They're agile, cunning creatures, and seem to thrive in 'packs'. %0a%0aThe larger variants seem to have an empathic level of influence over the smaller varieties, and don't suffer the inherent urge to destroy light sources mentioned below. %0a%0a!!!!Weaknesses%0a%0aWhen bright line is shined on them, they're incapable of retaining ephemeral form, and have an obsessive drive to snuff that light out. %0a%0a%0a!!!Pandora's Box%0a:Threat Level: Dangerous%0a:View/Visit/Study Clearances: Level 3/4/5%0a%0a!!!!Description%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='1px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=25px margin-right=25px width=300px height=300px%25http://i68.tinypic.com/16a2nmo.jpg%0a%0aThe keepsake box is made of a dark wood.

The only identifier on the box is a small brand on the bottom, barely perceivable these days, that traces back to a London craftsman from the 1800s. As a result of the heavy exposure to dark magics, any magic cast directly on the box is permanent.

Access to even the cameras is left to the Level 3 Viewing Room. %0a%0a!!!!Capabilities%0a%0aThe Box contains a powerful ward of sorts, that's keeping a potent entity bound up inside it with a form of permanent ritual sorcery. It's nearly unbreakable, and cannot be opened by any known mundane means outside of potentially direct, incredible amounts of force (and even this is untested).

At ST discretion, healing/restorative powers that are announced and the recipient is willing to receive might waive this.%0a*Powers altering/weakening/harming the Embassy itself, whether physically, temporally, spatially, spiritually, fate-wise, creating large scale illusions, or similar effects of any kind, or altering the space/time/fate/realm/etc of those within, will cause a Clash of Wills with the wards and needs a staff member present (or simply fails). If done for a hostile reason, the user is subject to being ‘shunted’ out (see below).%0a*Stealth power usage similarly requires a Clash of Wills against the wards, or it fails as soon as one enters the Embassy’s area of influence. If the power was being used for a hostile reason, they’re subject to being ‘shunted’, as described below.%0a*"Shunting:" Power usage done in any sort of ‘hostile’, ‘debilitating’, or even simply ‘debuffing’ manner will trigger the Embassy’s wards. Whether the effect succeeds or fails, the intent becomes obvious to the Wards immediately after completion, and the perpetrator is teleported out of the Embassy (if needbe, it will Clash powers meant to prevent this; if it fails, it will ‘try again’ on subsequent turns until it wins). %0a**Extreme instances, such as attempting or succeeding at killing someone, or similar heinous offenses against Accord members or the Embassy itself, will involve being ‘shunted’ into a sort of internal ‘Labyrinth’ within the Embassy; these are closed off rooms and looping hallways that are outside of normal reality,and don’t touch upon typical realms. Teleportation can only get out of this if it’s capable of doing so through unknown realms, and requires a Clash as normal. Should someone end up in such a room, the Ambassadors will immediately become aware.%0a**Mundane hostile actions will cause the user to be shunted as soon as the hostility of it is ‘obvious’ to a theoretical neutral observer. Drawing a knife and pointing it at someone is enough to trigger it, for instance. Similarly, ‘intimidating’ actions meant to provoke or subdue will also cause this reaction.%0a%0a%0a%0a(:tableend:)   %0a%0a(:include GameRef.Directorycity:)

Whether the effect succeeds or fails, the intent becomes obvious to the Wards immediately after completion, and the perpetrator is teleported out of the Embassy (if needbe, it will Clash powers meant to prevent this; if it fails, it will ‘try again’ on subsequent turns until it wins). %0a%3c **Extreme instances, such as attempting or succeeding at killing someone, or similar heinous offenses against Accord members or the Embassy itself, will involve being ‘shunted’ into a sort of internal ‘Labyrinth’ within the Embassy; these are closed off rooms and looping hallways that are outside of normal reality,and don’t touch upon typical realms. Teleportation can only get out of this if it’s capable of doing so through unknown realms, and requires a Clash as normal. Should someone end up in such a room, the Ambassadors will immediately become aware.%0a%3c **Mundane hostile actions will cause the user to be shunted as soon as the hostility of it is ‘obvious’ to a theoretical neutral observer. Drawing a knife and pointing it at someone is enough to trigger it, for instance.
