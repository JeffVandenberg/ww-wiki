Over the years she seemed to fill out, it almost seemed like a switch was flipped between seasons.  The braces removed, the skin tanned, the hair suddenly seem to be full of body and sleek.  Years of swimming had helped give her mild curves in the right places.  The only thing that never changed was the eyes.  Always a crystal blue of the seas.  No one can seem to agree when Torrance went from gangly kid to an almost perfect example of a woman.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25beast%25The Horror%0a%25center%25Torr's horror is what people would automatically link to a sea siren from tales. Her skin turns a sort of shimmery green/blue with a pattern of scales. Long and razor-sharp fangs fill her mouth, and when her jaws open you can see rows behind like a shark. Her eyes are the same color as the sea on a calm clear day. Her fingers are all webbed fully, but tiny tips of hooked claws could slide out. Her hair grows darker and has a rainbow type sheen to it, which seems to cover all of her body as she moves. Her feet are longer and webbed like flippers.%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25beast%25'''Contacts'''%0a%0a||! %25beast%25Image ||! %25beast%25PC Name ||! %25beast%25Relationship to PC ||! %25beast%25Comments  ||! %25beast%25Ringtone ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/uBA55pR.jpg || %25beast%25[[Ryan Seaberg]] || %25beast%25Swoonworthy Dream Boyfriend || %25beast%25''Torrance just stares at Ryan, disconnecting from everything else aroud them'' || %25newwin%25[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCXGJQYZ9JA|%25beast%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QGGfuSh.jpg || %25vampire%25[[Markus Kincaid]] || %25vampire%25Best Friend || %25vampire%25Protected me when I needed it..

Over the years she seemed to fill out, it almost seemed like a switch was flipped between seasons.  The braces removed, the skin tanned, the hair suddenly seem to be full of body and sleek.  Years of swimming had helped give her mild curves in the right places.  The only thing that never changed was the eyes.  Always a crystal blue of the seas.  No one can seem to agree when Torrance went from gangly kid to an almost perfect example of a woman.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25%25beast%25The Horror%0a%3c %25center%25Torr's horror is what people would automatically link to a sea siren from tales. Her skin turns a sort of shimmery green/blue with a pattern of scales. Long and razor-sharp fangs fill her mouth, and when her jaws open you can see rows behind like a shark. Her eyes are the same color as the sea on a calm clear day. Her fingers are all webbed fully, but tiny tips of hooked claws could slide out. Her hair grows darker and has a rainbow type sheen to it, which seems to cover all of her body as she moves. Her feet are longer and webbed like flippers.%0a---%0a> %25center%25[Enter here]%0a> %0a
