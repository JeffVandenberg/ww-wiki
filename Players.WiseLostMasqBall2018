The evenings flat wear felt like the consistency of polished bone, at the head of the room refreshments were available with three large cauldrons bubbling over a violet gas one labeled “Totally Poison” (Hedge Wine), the next “Poison” (Booze) the last labeled “Totally not Poison” (Non-Alcoholic). The entertainment for the night were dressed in funeral tuxes and wore skeletal half masks where they played music that crawled enhanced the feeling of the unknown, what was just out of sight but not out of mind. Rather conspicuously settled around the room for the privacy and protection of those within were security dressed as members of the undead, skeletons, ghosts, zombies and other not quite living fare.%0a%0aTonight's Soundtrack: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi2bVMHbdZw6guaxpSoMEnuy_5gz2dIgX%0a%0a||!

Welcoming, inviting, and warm, who wouldn't wish to dance with Apollo this night? ||%0a> || %25thumb%25https://www.picclickimg.com/00/s/MTAwMFgxMDAw/z/Ij8AAOSw2gxY3TjE/$/Creative-design-Phantom-for-men-Masquerade-Mask-Costume-_1.jpg || %25thumb%25https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/268804308676378634/508337622050144266/patchwork.jpg || Broken Man - Party masq || His broken mask conceals only half his face, as though his creator may have gotten bored with the concept somewhere along the line. || Put together swiftly and made more than his consumate parts, the Broken man lingers at the edge of the party.  There's nothing particularly supernatural about him, except for the unnerving aura that seems to follow him around.   A faint dissonance seems to linger, his movements are disjointed and lack grace, and yet the speed at which he moves draws ever more of that primative fear in one's mind out.  Who is this, why do they move so unnaturally?  Is he a man, or many men? ||%0a> || %25thumb%25https://img1.etsystatic.com/060/0/5495774/il_570xN.694060831_nqnj.jpg || %25thumb%25http://www.alternativebridalgowns.co.uk/Ice-Princess.jpg|| Issa Vintern - Party Masq || A white and icy blue mask, decorated with delicate lace and frosty crystals, overall forming an elaborate snowflake design. || Matching the mask, hers is a gown of light blue silks running to white at the hem.

Across her chest is painted the word 'Kallisti' in stylized script in gold paint. The back of her dress is bare, exposing the angel-in-chains tattoo on her back along with the faint hint of a heart on fire on her lower back. Around her neck was a golden choker with a diamond and ruby drop.  On her left wrist was a green ribbon twisted with gold beads, while on her feet were red to black ombre stilettos with golden spikes along the edges. Her curls were loose and pinned back in a romantic fashion, exposing her orange eyes to the world. She didn't wear a lot of makeup, letting her natural beauty stand out. ||%0a> || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/GgJ3EZU.jpg || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/WslDLmJ.jpg || Belisama - Party Masq || Description of Mask || A Victorian style gown in dark navy blue with black embroidery and lace ||%0a> || %25thumb%25https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6a/50/34/6a503406b28e80749a566f1744381d6d.jpg || %25thumb%25https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a3/0a/d5/a30ad59d20ef1ee0e58bb2b73508f722.jpg || Pathos- party masq || Three-faced mask, black with blue decorations. || Sleek Modern harlequin style in silk and leather. ||%0a> || %25thumb%25https://c1.neweggimages.com/ProductImage/A14T_1_20130705146728518.jpg || %25thumb%25https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718FrtT7rQL._UX342_.jpg || Freya - Party masq || A black mask adorned with leaves on the left and feathers on the right. || A navy blue knee length dress with a sweetheart neckline and black lace. ||%0a> || %25thumb%25http://www.vivashe.co.za/uploaded/productimages/1533784585Black%2520&%2520Silver%2520Venetian%2520Masquerade%2520Mask.jpg || %25thumb%25https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0f/2f/3c/0f2f3cc1e65c7696a2200df7598f0130.jpg || Selene - Party Masq || Almost a full faced mask of silver and black that seem to wrap perfectly around her face and meld into her silver hair || The dress is a shimmering silver satin with flowing sleeves of gossamer and an emerald shining ribbon embroidered around the bottom of the bodice along the top of a 'belt' of embroidered lace.

His suit is printed with an intricate stained glass pattern, like one might see within a cathedral. On his shoulders are a pair of epaulettes, also made of colored glass pieces, bits of it hanging off of chains down his arms and back. The outfit is finished off with some gold baroque style jewelry.  ||%0a> || %25thumb%25https://i.etsystatic.com/6953645/r/il/e2905f/1333663546/il_fullxfull.1333663546_11bs.jpg || %25thumb%25https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/196313473066598400/508158095596453888/ColtOutfit.jpg || Saint Sebastian - Party Masq|| An irreverent iconography places this halo around the dingy and dull bone of a mask that covers all but the lower jaw and eyes deep inside.

When one comes closer, the design seems to be shaped as little red droplets under gold and ivory cages. Finishing off the outfit is a crimson scarf, a red jasper necklace in the shape of an arrowhead, and a quartet of arrow bracelets binding his wrists. ||%0a> || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/tBm2tfe.jpg || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/tBm2tfe.jpg || Queen of Black Dragons - Party Masq || Shaped like the upper half of a dragon's skull.

She encompasses quiet wild growth of life and quiet the stillness of death. Pale ivory and pink flowers cascade in adroit vines around her mostly naked figure while matte black paint smears across her flesh to keep a whisper of modesty. Silvery cream hair tumbles from under the skull, the ends nesting at the small of her back, its lengths affixed with a glittering array of bird feathers and flowers. The only man-made artifact besides her own form and flesh is a pure silver chain draped from horn to horn, adding a soft twinkling refrain to each measured step she takes.   ||%0a> || %25thumb%25https://file.1001shops.com/Masquerade/m_Venetian-Masks_Full-Face-Feather-Masks_Full-White-Deco-Face-White-Feathers.jpg || %25thumb%25https://image.dhgate.com/0x0s/f2-albu-g5-M01-87-97-rBVaJFjDl3yAR_D7AAT78-ehnL0833.jpg/2017-white-and-black-bodycon-sheath-dress.jpg || Valva Albe - Party Masq || Her mask is golden with white feathers rising up || a white sheath dress leaving the shoulders bare ||%0a> || %25thumb%25https://sep.yimg.com/ay/mydivascloset/butterfly-masquerade-mask-28.jpg || %25thumb%25https://venusdancewear.com/679-large_default/black-gradational-ballroom-competition-standard-waltz-smooth-foxtrot-women-dance-dress.jpg || Caroline -party masq || A gold half butterfly masque || The woman has no signs of the supernatural upon her, smooth, elegant, and classy.

Other than a pair of leather jeans and their mask, this figure wears nothing else. There are horns that extrude from holes in the satin hood, sweeping back half a foot and sweeping upwards like a goats. The back of their arms have scales that cover up and over the shoulders, twining around their neck and down to cover their back and ribs. Under the arms are the patagia like wings of a bat, and their hands end in wicked looking talons. The eyes behind the mask shine when the light hits them just right, like a cat's shrewd gaze. ||%0a> || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png || Name || Description of Mask || Description of Outfit ||%0a> || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png || Name || Description of Mask || Description of Outfit ||%0a> || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png || Name || Description of Mask || Description of Outfit ||%0a> || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png || Name || Description of Mask || Description of Outfit ||%0a> || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png || Name || Description of Mask || Description of Outfit ||%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a

Other than a pair of leather jeans and their mask, this figure wears nothing else. There are horns that extrude from holes in the satin hood, sweeping back half a foot and sweeping upwards like a goats. The back of their arms have scales that cover up and over the shoulders, twining around their neck and down to cover their back and ribs. Under the arms are the patagia like wings of a bat, and their hands end in wicked looking talons. The eyes behind the mask shine when the light hits them just right, like a cat's shrewd gaze. ||%0a---%0a> || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png || %25thumb%25https://www.idjnow.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/placeholder.png || Name || Description of Mask || Description of Outfit ||%0a
