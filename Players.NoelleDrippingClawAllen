Her eyes are a rare hazel color that seems to flawlessly match compliment her hair. She keeps her body in good shape and has a toned form with some noticeable muscles. It's quite obvious that she works out to maintain her physique using her own methods.%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25%25width=200px%25https://i.imgur.com/IFuQ9JN.png%0a%25center%25 %25color=#ffcc99%25In urhan, Noelle takes on the form of a black wolf who's fur identically matches her hair in hishu. At night she is a bit more difficult to spot, especially if she sticks to the shadows. Noelle's urhan also retains her hazel eyes from her hishu form. While urhan is rarely a form she uses to kill, she does often use it for tracking her prey or just to laze about in.%0a%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25width=180px%25https://i.imgur.com/pCFION2.png%0a%0a!!!!%25width=390px%25https://i.imgur.com/aBJzw4x.png%0a%25color=#ffcc99%25Noelle excels at not being able to be seen or followed by other people, the shadows have long been a good friend to her and she wears the darkness well. If someone needs to be watched without them being much the wiser she could very well be a person to turn to for such a job.%0a%0a!!!!%25width=280px%25https://i.imgur.com/OKTlEBw.png%0a%25color=#ffcc99%25After a long day of running around doing this and that, sometimes you just want to take a seat in a bar and grab a drink. Or if you're feeling like you want to keep the party moving, head on over to a local night club, while Noelle won't want to be the center of attention she does enjoy going out, having fun, and learning more about her new surroundings.%0a%0a!!!!%25width=300px%25https://i.imgur.com/gLjVtzb.png%0a%25color=#ffcc99%25Dripping Claw is a member of the Lodge of Garm, a prestigious Lodge dedicated to hunting and killing the most dangerous prey to the forsaken and their eternal foe, the Anshega. Despite her lack of Glory, she has participated in many battles and it is rumored that she shifts the story of those battles. Not exactly lying about them but embellishing the actions of others so her's pale in comparison. After all, its hard to be a good Irraka if everyone's heard of you. %0a%0a!!!!%25width=250px%25https://i.imgur.com/gYUO3qY.png%0a%25color=#ffcc99%25Noelle has only been in town for a couple of months and has yet to form a complete circle of friends. As such she often seeks to amend this inconvenience. She has also yet to fully establish a job, while she picks up the occasional side job, she doesn't have a real full time job herself. She manages to get by but is actively seeking employment.%0a%0a!!!!%25width=430px%25https://i.imgur.com/rjhoqTM.png%0a%25color=#ffcc99%25Dripping Claw has been chasing a Predator King by the name of Bloodmaw for months. Her tracking of him has lead her to Miami where she hopes to finally settle an old debt that can only be paid for with the man's death. This specific hunt is very personal for her as he is responsible for the death of her brother.%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25width=240px%25https://i.imgur.com/gweiAxa.png%0a%0a|| %25width=150px%25https://i.imgur.com/fX5NKY9.png ||! %25werewolf%25[[Angel Payne]] ||! %25werewolf%25Packmate ||! %25werewolf%25Comments ||! %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25werewolf%25Ringtone]] ||%0a||! %25width=150px%25https://i.imgur.com/Nqx30qf.jpg ||! %25werewolf%25[[JosephineGarcia|Josephine Garcia]] ||! %25werewolf%25Packmate ||! %25werewolf%25Comment ||! %25werewolf%25Ringtone ||%0a|| %25width=150px%25https://i.imgur.com/u6hUmg4.jpg ||! %25werewolf%25[[PamelaSalam|Pam]] ||! %25werewolf%25Girlfriend ||! %25werewolf%25Comments ||! %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25werewolf%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25width=150px%25https://i.imgur.com/1XinTRu.jpg ||! %25werewolf%25[[TempestPax|Pax]] ||! %25werewolf%25Drinking and party buddy ||! %25werewolf%25Comments ||! %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25werewolf%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/BC0eaKc.png || %25werewolf%25PC Name || %25werewolf%25Relationship to PC || %25werewolf%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25werewolf%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a(:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a!!%25center%25%25width=200px%25https://i.imgur.com/vFrvPrP.png%0a(:cellnr width=100%25:)%0a%0a%0a%25werewolf%25 "Smart, Sharp girl.
