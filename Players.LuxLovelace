They reigned as the Alpha pack for almost four Decades.%25%25%0a*Lux is the youngest of four kids. Her three older brothers all first changed when they hit puberty. However, when Lux's time came she never got the change. A disappointment in the eyes of the family. She threw herself into learning other skills to help the pack.%0a*%25color=#6E227C%25Her family had a vast farm, where all the of the family lived over 100 acres. They farmed cotton, along with growing their own food. So from a young age, she was involved in farm life. From helping work the equipment to tending to the animals. %25%25%0a*When her waystone tell showed up she started to help out when rituals and other things to help out as the portable loci. When they found her skill with helping among rituals and fetish making, it was like she was the golden child. %0a*%25color=#6E227C%25From a young age she was given a bb gun, she met [[WMustang|%25vampire%25Mustang%25%25]] %25color=#6E227C%25when she accidentally mistook him for a predator and shot him while on parol, then a rifle for hunting and finally when she was about 15 she went along on her first mission.%25%25%0a*She had been practicing with the new assault rifle she'd gotten for her birthday. Her brother had spent weeks helping her learn how to use all the stuff and aiming with the scopes. The pack laid traps to funnel the pack of pure that had been harassing the city. Lux was up and away from the actual action. With her gun and scope. She helped to pick off and wound the pure as they charged in. After that one fight, her parents agreed that she was ready to join the pack %0a*%25color=#6E227C%25For the next four years, she went on missions and helped to pick off from afar, she and beauty(Her rifle) helped to keep Savannah safe from those who wished to enslave it. When she was almost 18, she was just about to start learning how to perform rites for the pack. %25%25%0a*Disaster struck, Lux was hospitalized with what they thought was the flu. The pack went out to deal with a new pack of fire touched. The pack had been tricked and slaughtered, it was just one pack it was four moving in.  Lux had been begging her parents and the pack to change their tactics, she blames herself for not pushing harder.  Among the Bone Shadows and packs around the south, what happened to Lawless is told as a cautionary tale, warning them to always try and not get stuck in ruts with how they deal with enemies. %0a*%25color=#6E227C%25It's known that Lux spent the years between when her pack was killed and when she moved to Portland with her Aunt Michelle.  But not much is known about what all went on during that time, Lux seems reluctent to speak about it.%25%25%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a(:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a%0a(:cellnr

They reigned as the Alpha pack for almost four Decades.%25%25%0a%3c *Lux is the youngest of four kids. Her three older brothers all first changed when they hit puberty. However, when Lux's time came she never got the change. A disappointment in the eyes of the family. She threw herself into learning other skills to help the pack.%0a%3c *%25color=#6E227C%25Her family had a vast farm, where all the of the family lived over 100 acres. They farmed cotton, along with growing their own food. So from a young age, she was involved in farm life. From helping work the equipment to tending to the animals. %25%25%0a%3c *When her waystone tell showed up she started to help out when rituals and other things to help out as the portable loci. When they found her skill with helping among rituals and fetish making, it was like she was the golden child. %0a%3c *%25color=#6E227C%25From a young age she was given a bb gun, she met [[WMustang|%25vampire%25Mustang%25%25]] %25color=#6E227C%25when she accidentally mistook him for a predator and shot him while on parol, then a rifle for hunting and finally when she was about 15 she went along on her first mission.%25%25%0a%3c *She had been practicing with the new assault rifle she'd gotten for her birthday. Her brother had spent weeks helping her learn how to use all the stuff and aiming with the scopes. The pack laid traps to funnel the pack of pure that had been harassing the city. Lux was up and away from the actual action. With her gun and scope. She helped to pick off and wound the pure as they charged in. After that one fight, her parents agreed that she was ready to join the pack %0a%3c *%25color=#6E227C%25For the next four years, she went on missions and helped to pick off from afar, she and beauty(Her rifle) helped to keep Savannah safe from those who wished to enslave it. When she was almost 18, she was just about to start learning how to perform rites for the pack. %25%25%0a%3c *Disaster struck, Lux was hospitalized with what they thought was the flu. The pack went out to deal with a new pack of fire touched. The pack had been tricked and slaughtered, it was just one pack it was four moving in.  Lux had been begging her parents and the pack to change their tactics, she blames herself for not pushing harder.  Among the Bone Shadows and packs around the south, what happened to Lawless is told as a cautionary tale, warning them to always try and not get stuck in ruts with how they deal with enemies. %0a%3c *%25color=#6E227C%25It's known that Lux spent the years between when her pack was killed and when she moved to Portland with her Aunt Michelle.  But not much is known about what all went on during that time, Lux seems reluctent to speak about it.%25%25%0a---%0a> !!%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/LvWYZ06.png%0a> *Know Deed%0a> *Know Deed%0a>
