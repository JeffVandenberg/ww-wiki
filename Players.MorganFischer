Her hair is mixed shot through with feathers in various shades of brown and cream. Her eyes are a gold and raptorial. They stand out quite strikingly thanks to the dark band that stretches across her face from one temple to the other. The rest of Morgan's figure is perhaps a work in progress. While she is not covered in feathers, markings across pale skin give the impression that she should have them. Just below her knees and elbows, her skin gives way to grey-white scales and her hands and feet are tipped with sharp black claws. Vestigial wings rest just above Morgan's proper shoulders. They span only a little wider than the length of her outstretched fingertips. The left wing seems complete in the sense that all of the feathers resemble those of an osprey, but the right wing is more of a work in progress. Dark brown banded feathers give way to cream colored parchment as scrawled schematics and shorthand span a wide swath of of her coverts and primaries, detailing length and attachment like some sort of schematic. %0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Mantle''%0a%0a%25center%25 The air hangs heavy with the mingled scent ozone and petrichor.
