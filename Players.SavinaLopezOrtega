You would never guess she was in her 40’s and generally had a love of revolutionary and political theory. She dresses fashionably but never in name brands. She seems to almost prefer knock offs for the message it sends, does anyone else get the message? She doesn’t know but she likes it regardless. Savina tends to carry herself with confidence and a lot of the time she will have paint stains on the tips of her fingers.%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/5BysuHu.png%0aPale skin with cold eyes, she tends to look a little leaner and her nails look a little sharper.

Her parties are not your average raves and they’re not some high society shindig. They’re dirty, violent, sexual, and not the kind of thing you want to be associated with in polite company…but that just adds to the fun right?%0a*'''%25color=#03E1F3%25Rebel Girl (Carthians, Vampires)''': Savina is a passionate revolutionary. She cut her teeth on protests in her mortal life and has since then continued to try and build a strong case for Vampiric Revolution, a bloody red rebellion against the powers that be. The smallest Cuban Vampire though is still new to this and while she can deliver a damn fiery speech she isn’t the best at organization and hasn’t actually been able to build up enough support to effect real change, but that doesn’t stop her.%0a*'''%25color=#CD1D5E%25Street Artist (Artists, Streetwise Characters)''': From Anti-Government works of art to rallying pieces for local communities. Savina takes to the streets armed with a selection of spray paint cans and loses herself in the art she puts on public display. Her artwork is almost always political in nature but she does hide clues for fellow Carthians to denote safe places or areas to avoid.%0a(:div2end:)%0a-----%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/OVQNRmk.png%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #B8860B' margin-top=0px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=25px width=250px height=250px%25https://i.imgur.com/PIJMbu1.png%0a*%25color=#03E1F3%25[[https://youtu.be/m3Sr8N6W7v4|Teenage Anarchist]]%0a*%25color=#CD1D5E%25[[https://youtu.be/jSZWslqjfPE|Which Side Are You On?]]%0a*%25color=#03E1F3%25[[https://youtu.be/RQ9xveRsWxo|Party Hard]]%0a(:div2end:)%0a-----%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/eo36Cy8.png%0a(:table:)%0a(:cellnr width=50%25 align=left style='padding-right: 10px;':)%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=4px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=0px width=75%25https://i.imgur.com/R0s4tx6.jpeg%0a%25color=#CD1D5E%25[[KatyaOrlov|Katya]]\\%0a%25white%25My sweet sweet ghoul.
