Stephens in 1846, who bought the claim from John McLoughlin of the Hudson's Bay Company. The city was incorporated in 1871.%0a%0aStephens platted the land from the Willamette River to East First Street, and from today's Glisan Street to present Hawthorne Boulevard. Much of the land east of the river was marshy and crossed by creeks and sloughs, so it was less desirable than Portland river front property on the west side of the Willamette River. Development was difficult and expensive since many streets had to be built on trestles.%0a%0aA few years after Stephens acquired his land, Gideon Tibbetts filed a Donation Land Claim for 640 acres (260 ha) south of what is now Division Street in southeast Portland. Tibbetts founded the first flour mill on the east side of the Willamette, planted extensive orchards, and raised hay on part of his claim. He platted some of this land in the Brooklyn neighborhood, and platted an addition to East Portland. Tibbetts later sold some parcels and his flour mill to Stephens. The value of East Portland waterfront property skyrocketed in 1869, when the East-Side Oregon Central Railroad connecting East Portland and Salem was completed. Railroad magnate Ben Holladay established ferry service across the Willamette to Portland from the northern terminus of the railroad about that time; the boat was superseded in 1880 by the Oregon & California Railroad Ferry No. 2, put into service by Henry Villard, and later by the Steel and Morrison bridges.%0a%0aOn July 6, 1891, the cities of East Portland, Albina and Portland merged as the city of Portland, Oregon. At the time, the population of East Portland was estimated to be 11,457. In about the same year, Ladd's Addition, which lay between the Stephens and Tibbetts land claims, was converted from farm land to a residential neighborhood.%0a%0a!!%25center%25''The modern district in the eastern part of Portland''%0a%0aThe term East Portland now refers to the portion of the city east of 82nd Avenue, where approximately 28%25 of Portland's population resides. Much of Portland's black and minority population have moved east of 82nd Avenue, as of 2011, in a trend that was expected to continue.%0a%0aIn March 2015, a group called East Portland de-Annexation Secession filed a measure with the City of Portland, and are petitioning to secede from Portland. However, Deborah Scroggin, Portland's election officer, rejected the petition because it did not meet requirements of Section 1 (2) (d) and (5) Article IV of the Oregon Constitution. Collene Swenson, a resident of East Portland, said that she will draft the new initiative, with the help of lawyers.  Over the last five years, east Portland’s Hazelwood neighborhood there were almost 1,000 more calls for police, due to serious and violent crime, than were made downtown. The city classifies crime in clusters, the most serious, are part-one crimes, and includes, murder, rape but also larceny and burglary.  Hazelwood, with over 23,462 residents covering 2,625 acres, is one of the largest neighborhoods in Portland. The neighborhood has about 2.31 of part-one crimes per person.  Of the top 35 most dangerous neighborhoods, there are 13 located in east Portland, and nine with over 2,000 calls for police service on serious and violent crime, way above the average for a Portland city neighborhood.%0a%0a[[#to]]%0a!!%25center%25''Argay''%0a%0aEast Portland neighborhoods like Argay are located within a wealth of shopping, dining, and other amenities.

Hazelwood does have a mix of residential and commercial areas.  The largest area employer is the Adventist Hospital, and there are a lot of other medical related businesses in the area (mostly closer to 102nd Ave).   You'll find Mall 205 and the Gateway Shopping Center, many retail shops, and some automobile-related businesses such as car dealerships, which are primarily located along 122nd Ave.  Family friendly. A great mix of suburban and urban areas, with easy access to shopping, dining, and public transportation.%0a%0aThis area features modest family homes, with many ranch style and cape cod homes, generally built in the 1950s-1960s.  There are a few original older homes mixed throughout the neighborhood, as well as some new development such as townhouses and row houses.  %0a%0aBecause Hazelwood is not located "close in" to downtown Portland, homes are still more affordable than many other areas in Portland.  This may also a good area to check if you are looking for a starter home.  Once the area is fully redeveloped with improvements to the aesthetics of the area such as additional tree plantings and other upgrades to storefronts and community areas, given it's proximity to convenient transportation options, there is good potential that property values may rise accordingly over the next several years.%0a%0aThe recent new development of townhouses, apartment buildings and multi-story condos in the area is because the Gateway area has been designated (by Metro's 2040 plan) as a Regional Center.  This means it has been zoned to eventually have a density similar to the Pearl District or the Lloyd Center.  This doesn't apply to the entire neighborhood, but does cover the area between the Gateway Shopping Center and Mall 205%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a[[Players.TheRussianMafia|The Russian Mafia]]%0a%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' •••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Lents''%0a%0aLents is an East Portland neighborhood with a nice mix of residential communities, while still being close to major roadways for plenty of access to shopping and other amenities and an easy commute.

Interstate 84 runs through the middle of the neighborhood.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Wilkes School property was donated by the Wilkes family. The Wilkes also settled Banks and Wilkesboro in the Dairy Creek area. The Wilkes were the family that Dr. John McLoughlin sent Noble Ellis up to Mt. Hood to rescue in the winter of 1847. The Wilkes Family Book "By an Oregon Pioneer Fireside" written by L. E. Wilkes is located in the Oregon State Legislative Library. The first park established in the neighborhood was Wilkes Park. The land for the park was acquired in 1998 and the park was dedicated August 3, 2004. Since then, the city's parks department and its Bureau of Environmental Services partnered to acquire 20 acres (8.1 ha) of land at the headwaters of Wilkes Creek in March 2011 to create a second park and natural preservation area%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Collene Swenson, a resident of East Portland, said that she will draft the new initiative, with the help of lawyers.  Over the last five years, east Portland’s Hazelwood neighborhood there were almost 1,000 more calls for police, due to serious and violent crime, than were made downtown. The city classifies crime in clusters, the most serious, are part-one crimes, and includes, murder, rape but also larceny and burglary.  Hazelwood, with over 23,462 residents covering 2,625 acres, is one of the largest neighborhoods in Portland. The neighborhood has about 2.31 of part-one crimes per person.  Of the top 35 most dangerous neighborhoods, there are 13 located in east Portland, and nine with over 2,000 calls for police service on serious and violent crime, way above the average for a Portland city neighborhood.%0a---%0a> In March 2015, a group called East Portland de-Annexation Secession filed a measure with the City of Portland, and are petitioning to secede from Portland.

Stephens in 1846, who bought the claim from John McLoughlin of the Hudson's Bay Company. The city was incorporated in 1871.%0a%3c %0a%3c Stephens platted the land from the Willamette River to East First Street, and from today's Glisan Street to present Hawthorne Boulevard. Much of the land east of the river was marshy and crossed by creeks and sloughs, so it was less desirable than Portland river front property on the west side of the Willamette River. Development was difficult and expensive since many streets had to be built on trestles.%0a%3c %0a%3c A few years after Stephens acquired his land, Gideon Tibbetts filed a Donation Land Claim for 640 acres (260 ha) south of what is now Division Street in southeast Portland. Tibbetts founded the first flour mill on the east side of the Willamette, planted extensive orchards, and raised hay on part of his claim. He platted some of this land in the Brooklyn neighborhood, and platted an addition to East Portland. Tibbetts later sold some parcels and his flour mill to Stephens. The value of East Portland waterfront property skyrocketed in 1869, when the East-Side Oregon Central Railroad connecting East Portland and Salem was completed. Railroad magnate Ben Holladay established ferry service across the Willamette to Portland from the northern terminus of the railroad about that time; the boat was superseded in 1880 by the Oregon & California Railroad Ferry No. 2, put into service by Henry Villard, and later by the Steel and Morrison bridges.%0a%3c %0a%3c On July 6, 1891, the cities of East Portland, Albina and Portland merged as the city of Portland, Oregon. At the time, the population of East Portland was estimated to be 11,457. In about the same year, Ladd's Addition, which lay between the Stephens and Tibbetts land claims, was converted from farm land to a residential neighborhood.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!'''The modern district in the eastern part of Portland'''%0a
