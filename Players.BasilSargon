He seems easy going, or relaxed one moment, but can make simmering jokes the next that test the waters. Even when he seems friendly, talking to the drifter can be a bit like a verbal spar; he leaves no stone unturned and always seems to correct or jibe, even if it's almost always good-natured. Still, he's quick to take any kind of charity or handout anyone will offer, and is gracious about that in particular; he won't ever bite the hand that feeds him.%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c (:div2end:)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Contacts'''%0a%3c %0a%3c ||! %25mortal%25Image ||! %25mortal%25Name ||! %25mortal%25Relationship ||! %25mortal%25Comment ||! %25mortal%25Ringtone ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c %0a%3c (:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Hooks'''%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25mortal%25 ''Junkyard Rabbit (Drivers)'': %0a%3c Hook info here%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25mortal%25 ''Freelancer (Criminals)'': %0a%3c Hook info here%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25mortal%25 ''Fine Arts (High Society)'': %0a%3c Hook info here%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c (:div2end:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:cellnr width=100%25:)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''Quotes'''%0a%3c %0a%3c %25mortal%25 "I am a quote!
