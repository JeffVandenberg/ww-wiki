Description%0aTyee is a rather unassuming 5'10” tall and weighs in at just under 180 lbs.  He has long black hair and brown eyes, and has a reputation around the reservation and the local native americans as being one of the pretty ones.  He usually dresses in some of the most outlandish clothing (according to his family) when he's been at work, with leather moccasins, jeans, a large metal belt buckle, a denim shirt with geometic shapes stitched into it, and a leather vest with totemic animals painted on it.  In short, like the stereotypical native american should look, according to television.  Otherwise, he sticks to simple jeans, boots, and a t-shirt.%0a!!Currently - %0a%0aTyee has recently returned to Portland from who knows where.  It isn’t like he ever stuck around long enough to put down real roots, anyway.  However, that ever present smile that had been starting to fade seems to have returned with a vigor and he shows some signs of being rejuvenated.%0a%0a!!

Most of his family and members of his tribe tend to despise how he is always seeming to try his hardest into fitting into the stereotype of a television “Indian.”  However, they tend to settle down and laugh with him when they realize what he convinces people to buy for decorations. \\%0a----%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=350px height=450px%25 https://i.imgur.com/BL1NRlJ.jpg%0a%0a!!
