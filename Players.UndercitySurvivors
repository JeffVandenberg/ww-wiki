The spirit of Cooperation that lives within, ever happy to help, builds a cohesive working group for those who are willing to truly work together. Misfits, unfortunates, psychics without a place... All are welcome, and with the destruction of Maelstrom, a new beginning is forming. The people of the Undercity were originally drawn by the promises of Maelstrom, but without his hand to lead them through his manipulation of the spirits, they are back to the basics, trying to forge their own paths forward.%0a%0aLiving in the tunnels, trying to make ends meet, the psychics of the Undercity are a hearty group that is used to struggle. Together, they hope to forge a new place for themselves.  The Undercity, above all else, is a community that feels that it doesn't quite fit anywhere else.  While some may eventually find places among the factions, most feel displaced, and just as happy to stay among the others that they have lived with and next to, since the debacle with the Lucky 7 and their fight with the Rose City Guild began.%0a%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''%25color=#669999%25Purpose''' \\%0a%0aNot the most trusting people, considering their recent learning of the fact that they were held under the sway of captive spirits, they now are willing to follow the two who brought them back to their freedom.  The two who are willing to help them keep their freedom.  Now they work to rebuild, both their homes and their community.  Not to mention their trust in the world around them.  The hope is, they'll be something for the rest of the city to eventually look up to, instead of down at.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''%25color=#669999%25Doctrine''' \\%0a%0aAll members have access to the Temple within but are not required to live in the Undercity.  It is more a cult formed out of mutual wants for the survival of the people there. All splats are welcomed. The goal of this MCI is to build on the community so that they can be more self-sufficient, and to make certain that they continue to maintain their freedom.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''%25color=#669999%25Ties to the setting''' \\%0a%0aRecently the undercity was held under the thumb of Maelstrom and his band of goons.  The vampires used their skill to remove the goons from the Undercity.  Remy, with Charlie watching his back, removed Maelstrom and helped to free & heal the oracle and spirit choir that Maelstrom had taken over to keep the undercity people under his rule.  The Undercity was damaged by the recent earthquake, Remy, Charlie, VB, and Sam want to make sure that those who wish to stay in the Undercity, have the help they need to make their life better.  Those who wish to leave the Undercity will also have the option to try living on the surface%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''%25color=#669999%25Titles and Mechanics''' \\%0a%0a%25center%25%25color=#669999%25'''Status 1''' [[%3c%3c]]%0a%25center%25%25color=#669999%25''- Safe Place 1, The Underground Temple'' -%25%25 [[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25center%25The temple is the social market of the Undercity, people trading, building and working together.

The spirit of Cooperation that lives within, ever happy to help, builds a cohesive working group for those who are willing to truly work together. Misfits, unfortunates, psychics without a place... All are welcome, and with the destruction of Maelstrom, a new beginning is forming. The people of the Undercity were originally drawn by the promises of Maelstrom, but without his hand to lead them through his manipulation of the spirits, they are back to the basics, trying to forge their own paths forward.%0a%3c %0a%3c Living in the tunnels, trying to make ends meet, the psychics of the Undercity are a hearty group that is used to struggle. Together, they hope to forge a new place for themselves.  The Undercity, above all else, is a community that feels that it doesn't quite fit anywhere else.  While some may eventually find places among the factions, most feel displaced, and just as happy to stay among the others that they have lived with and next to, since the debacle with the Lucky 7 and their fight with the Rose City Guild began.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!'''%25color=#669999%25Purpose''' \\%0a%3c %0a%3c Not the most trusting people, considering their recent learning of the fact that they were held under the sway of captive spirits, they now are willing to follow the two who brought them back to their freedom.  The two who are willing to help them keep their freedom.  Now they work to rebuild, both their homes and their community.  Not to mention their trust in the world around them.  The hope is, they'll be something for the rest of the city to eventually look up to, instead of down at.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!'''%25color=#669999%25Doctrine''' \\%0a%3c %0a%3c All members have access to the Temple within but are not required to live in the Undercity.  It is more a cult formed out of mutual wants for the survival of the people there. All splats are welcomed. The goal of this MCI is to build on the community so that they can be more self-sufficient, and to make certain that they continue to maintain their freedom.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!'''%25color=#669999%25Ties to the setting''' \\%0a%3c %0a%3c Recently the undercity was held under the thumb of Maelstrom and his band of goons.  The vampires used their skill to remove the goons from the Undercity.  Remy, with Charlie watching his back, removed Maelstrom and helped to free & heal the oracle and spirit choir that Maelstrom had taken over to keep the undercity people under his rule.  The Undercity was damaged by the recent earthquake, Remy, Charlie, VB, and Sam want to make sure that those who wish to stay in the Undercity, have the help they need to make their life better.  Those who wish to leave the Undercity will also have the option to try living on the surface%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!'''%25color=#669999%25Titles and Mechanics''' \\%0a%3c %0a%3c 1: A Skill Spec or 1 dot merit (Safe Place 1, The Underground Temple)- The temple is the social market of the Undercity, people trading, building and working together. As such, it is possibly the most defensible place within the tunnels. Newcomers to the Undercity are often even sheltered within until it can be found what best they can do to help their community. \\%0a%3c 2: A 1 dot merit (Direction Sense)- The tunnels are hard to navigate, having been turned into smuggling tunnels years ago, but with some work, it becomes easier to note symbols and sigils to navigate further out to the outskirts of the Undercity. \\%0a%3c 3: A skill or a 2 dot merit(Often Supernatural) (Locus 2- Undercity Temple)- The deeper levels of the temple contain a small but important Locus that has been the hub of the Cooperation spirit's influence on the area. Those who are proven worthy enough, often the most helpful for defenses or procuring supplies, are granted access to the Locus, where the spirit's influence can help deepen their resolve. \\%0a%3c 4: A 3 dot merit (Often Supernatural)(Biokinesis 3)- Heroes emerge in small groups where cooperation tends to be a survival tool. A mother lifts a car off of her child, a man wrestles a bear away from his family... The Undercity takes it a step further, with the spiritual influence flowing. Those who prove themselves heroic to the cause of the Undercity are able to shift strengths to fit the situation that they need, whether, from exposure to the Locus or something else, those that achieve this level within the Undercity's structure are able to shift stats to better take advantage of their bodies. \\%0a%3c 5: A 3 dot merit or major advantage (Master Shaper 3- Undercity specific)- Perhaps more a side effect of Remy's meddling in the Undercity, a twisted form of his spell casting has become intrinsic to the Undercity itself. Any who would be considered a leader within the group, are able to affect the items and landscape of the Undercity to help the people in either positive ways for the people, or negative ways for the intruders (books that read themselves, statues that guard the tunnels, etc...) \\%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!'''%25color=#669999%25Contact''' \\%0a%3c %0a%3c Remy or Charlie%0a
