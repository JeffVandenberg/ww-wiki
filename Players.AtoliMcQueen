A slightly wide nose, her head is framed by thick spirals of curls of medium brown with sun-bleached highlights that hang so heavy they frame her head by several inches on each side, while also descending to her upper chest and mid-back.%0aShe has silver eyes with a feral glint framed by a gray so dark it could be mistaken for black. Said eyes are framed by long, thick black lashes and with a pair of medium brown fine arches for brows. She is of slender frame with a lightly toned yet feminine build. Often her left shoulder has a large bite mark that will sometimes bleed through her clothes depending on what she is wearing.%0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25color=#E496FF%25'''Hooks'''%0a%0a!!!!%25color=#E496FF%25 ''I'm What Now?!?!(Werewolf/Wolf-Blooded)'':%0aShe was recently bitten and is very new into the life of being a blooded. She could use a helping hand or paw very often in this new life.%0a%0a!!!!%25color=#E496FF%25 ''Artist(All)'': %0aShe loves to paint in the styles of surrealism and fantasy realism in her art pieces. She also dabbles in sculpting from time to time but is isn't her preferred medium. With rumors that she might be opening up a gallery of her newly arrived work soon, she is garnering a bit of local fame and an image within the artistic society of Miami.%0a %0a!!!!%25color=#E496FF%25 ''Mute(All)'':%0aSomething very traumatic happened when she was little and just stopped speaking. Hopefully one knows sign language or at least has the patience for her to write out her answers.%0a%0a!!!!%25color=#E496FF%25 ''Out of Towner(All)'':%0aShe is originally from Boston and freshly in Miami. Are you also from Boston? Do you know her already?%0a%0a!!!!%25color=#E496FF%25 ''Seeking Someone(All)'': %0aShe seems to be on the hunt for her birth father.
