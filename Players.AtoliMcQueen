Her hair is a tangled cascade of curls that rises up from her hair before hanging naturally down to dust her shoulders. Her almond-shaped eyes are enhanced by smoky kohl adorning the eyelashes and also forming sharp, narrow lines from the outer corners of the eyes to the temples. Her fine-featured face is also enhanced by red ochre ranging from her upper eyelids down to her cheekbones vertically and ranging from the front edge of her ears forward, even covering nearly all of her slender nose. Freckles also enhance the ochre as well. Slender tapered ears are left visible from the front, as her hair is kept more behind them, as her moderately plump lips are accented with burgundy stained lips.
