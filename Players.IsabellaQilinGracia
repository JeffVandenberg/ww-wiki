Am I the girl, the little asian girl with the cuban family that everyone sees, that dies 'her hair all those colors and wears these awesome clothes? Am i a HORSE? Am i all those other things i can be? Am i all of them at once? I don't even know anymore, I try not to think about it. Thinking about it makes me upset. IM AN IZZY! '%0a%0a%25beast%25Isabella stands out in a crowd immediately. Tall and long limbed, thin and busty, her hair and clothes in a multitude of colors and a wide easy smile she is someone you remember. Round north Chinese features are prominent in her face, which she often makes up brilliantly in sparkles and colors to match her wardrobe. Izzy walks almost a little clumsy with her limbs not quite matching her gait, not unlike seeing a young horse learning to run, its not uncommon to see her fall or stumble. %0a%0a%25beast%25In her Mien for those that can see its apparent that izzy is an anthropomorphic bicorn with silver fur and flowing hair on her limbs and a soft marvelous tail. Along with her powerful equine body she has a curling horn on her head, and a curved antler above it that actually looks quite deadly were she to impale you with it. A blessing of Spring, she possesses an aura of rainbow colors and sparkles that erupt from her body wherever she moves. Flowering plants erupt and fall from her body and wildflowers seem to bloom in her steps where they land%0a%0a%25center%25%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=10px border='2px solid #6e68a3' width=305 margin-right=0px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=10px newwin%25 https://i.imgur.com/jSfIp2E.jpg%0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a!!%25left%25%25beast%25'''History in the City'''%0a%0a%25beast%25"Please don't ask me to talk about it ok? Im a PLAYMATE. You know what that means right? My time with THEM wasn't like your time. I know the things THEY do are just awful but they were never awful to me. They liked me, we played together all day. They combed me and rode me and ran me and i was so good. I don't know why they got rid of me and forgot me, but you all helped me anyway, you didn't need to but you did. Im your friend now, all your friend. We're going to run and jump and play and I'll hit and fight and bleed to keep you here with me and stay my friend. I miss them though. I miss them everyday. Help me think of something else, help me not think at all? Whatever that's fun you want to do together im totally game but Whatever you do though don't ask me to talk about it, ok? Dont ask me to talk about THEM. "%0a%0a%25beast%25The Lost of Miami found her on the street and they took her in, and welcomed her as one of their own even though some of them whispered she clearly wasn't. She was a Playmate after all, they have a certain reputation. They're usually rarer in the human side of the world, because they so rarely escape or have any reason to try. They're pampered. Izzy knew it must have been the same for her, and maybe there was some sort of mistake. Maybe she got Lost, out playing and ran too far! That must be it. One day she ran, out back into the Thorns to find her way home, but no matter how hard she ran she couldn't find it. She was usually so good at finding things. One of The Princess' favorite games was hide and seek, and Grace was pretty good at finding her hiding places. She was lost in the thorns, and all hope seemed lost. She was alone, and began to hear howling. Wolves closed in, but before they could attack the freehold came again and rescued her, together they fought the dire wolves and Izzy learned too just as her rescuers how strong a unicorn could actually be, and how thrilling and amazing the heat of the fight was. It was something unlike anything at home, there was never any fighting there at all. There was never any of the pleasures she found celebrating with one of her rescuers that night either in the Princess' palace. %0a%0a%25beast%25This world had its charms she had to admit, and its people had her gratitude. She learned their stories, and the injustices they suffered and that's when she decided she would stay with them. She would play and fight and love with them, and try her best to remember what it was like to be a human as apparently they all once were. She Swore their promises and put the past in Arcadia behind her. She was helped to find who she once was, and helped destroy the doll left in her place. She cried to break something that once belonged to HER but when she did, she remembered, REALLY remembered her name. She stays with friends in the freehold now, and has the time of her life doing it. She has to after all, every moment she pushes to be the best moment, because in those moments of awful quiet and stillness she can almost hear the voice of a Princess. %0a%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a----%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/FtJjurr.png%0a%0a!!!!%25chrisf%25 Easily Distracted [---(Anyonel)---]%0a-> its a PROBLEM. Izzy just can't keep her mind on anything for more than five minutes unless it's fun. She can't sit still, she can't stop and think, and she can't stick to a routine to save her life. She's tried, but can't manage to go to school and get a proper education (something someone taken as an elementary school kid could sorely need), she can't hold a steady job, and she would forget her head if it wasn't attached to her. On the other hand her tendency to wander leads her to the wildest adventures, and into the most unlikely places. Like the time she broke into unlicensed MMA fighting. Or the time she figured out shes a natural behind the wheel and started street racing and won this awesome bike. Or the time she got lost in a fetish club and forgot what a safeword was. It's almost like she is running away from something, or wants to think of anything else but what's on her mind%0a%0a%0a!!!!%25chrisf%25 Animal Whisperer [---(Any)---]%0a->Izzy, after long times searching for her calling has found it as Empyrean Farms own animal handler extraordinaire. The most gentle bee keeper, bird keeper, horse trainer, pest remover, and even veterinarian anyone could ever find izzy uses her special gifts with animals to keep them happy and healthy. If you have any questions concerning animals Isabella the unicorn might have solutions %0a%0a%0a!!!!%25chrisf%25 Claviger [---(Changeling, Spring Court)---]%0a->she might be a cute little horse with a horn but when the time has come Izzy can hit like... Well a horse with a sharp deadly horn. She was courted by the Summers for awhile for her strength and ferocity in the heat of a moment but she decided in the end that outside of the moments when she needed it anger just didn't taste great in her mouth. She's still game for a fight though, for missions or just for fun. Just don't blame her for getting knocked on your butt by a princess toy. She'll kiss it and make you feel better too. In recent nights her recognized prowess in battle and her talents for navigation in the hedge have earned her the title of Claviger, protector and champion of the Verdent Court %0a%0a!!!!%25chrisf%25 Right to Bear Arms? [--- (Supernatural, Changeling)---]%0a->izzy is a shapechanger, her skin fluid between a few different Beasts and traits belonging to them. Just as frequently as she might be in her human form she's at home in other shapes too, and in so many places. Some might say she seems more natural in a beasts skin than a person's, and maybe they're on to something. %0a[[%3c%3c]] %0a!!%25center%25%25chrisf%25''Shapes '' %0a|| %25thumb%25https://www.wallpaperup.com/uploads/wallpapers/2013/11/10/172440/331500fbe622d82b38f9823dfd11b818.jpg ||%25chrisf%25 Unicorn || %25chrisf%25 "Best go-to for land!"  || %25chrisf%25My first special shape I was in for a decade of my life with The Princess.

One day she ran, out back into the Thorns to find her way home, but no matter how hard she ran she couldn't find it. She was usually so good at finding things. One of The Princess' favorite games was hide and seek, and Grace was pretty good at finding her hiding places. She was lost in the thorns, and all hope seemed lost. She was alone, and began to hear howling. Wolves closed in, but before they could attack the freehold came again and rescued her, together they fought the dire wolves and Izzy learned too just as her rescuers how strong a unicorn could actually be, and how thrilling and amazing the heat of the fight was.

Izzy just can't keep her mind on anything for more than five minutes unless it's fun. She can't sit still, she can't stop and think, and she can't stick to a routine to save her life. She's tried, but can't manage to go to school and get a proper education (something someone taken as an elementary school kid could sorely need), she can't hold a steady job, and she would forget her head if it wasn't attached to her. On the other hand her tendency to wander leads her to the wildest adventures, and into the most unlikely places. Like the time she broke into unlicensed MMA fighting. Or the time she figured out shes a natural behind the wheel and started street racing and won this awesome bike. Or the time she got lost in a fetish club and forgot what a safeword was. It's almost like she is running away from something, or wants to think of anything else but what's on her mind%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25mage%25 Animal Whisperer [---(Any)---]%0a%3c ->Izzy, after long times searching for her calling has found it as Empyrean Farms own animal handler extraordinaire. The most gentle bee keeper, bird keeper, horse trainer, pest remover, and even veterinarian anyone could ever find izzy uses her special gifts with animals to keep them happy and healthy. If you have any questions concerning animals Isabella the unicorn might have solutions %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25mage%25 Claviger [---(Changeling, Spring Court)---]%0a%3c ->she might be a cute little horse with a horn but when the time has come Izzy can hit like... Well a horse with a sharp deadly horn. She was courted by the Summers for awhile for her strength and ferocity in the heat of a moment but she decided in the end that outside of the moments when she needed it anger just didn't taste great in her mouth. She's still game for a fight though, for missions or just for fun. Just don't blame her for getting knocked on your butt by a princess toy. She'll kiss it and make you feel better too. In recent nights her recognized prowess in battle and her talents for navigation in the hedge have earned her the title of Claviger, protector and champion of the Verdent Court %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25mage%25 Right to Bear Arms? [--- (Supernatural, Changeling)---]%0a%3c ->izzy is a shapechanger, her skin fluid between a few different Beasts and traits belonging to them. Just as frequently as she might be in her human form she's at home in other shapes too, and in so many places. Some might say she seems more natural in a beasts skin than a person's, and maybe they're on to something. %0a%3c [[%3c%3c]] %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25mage%25''Shapes '' %0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://www.wallpaperup.com/uploads/wallpapers/2013/11/10/172440/331500fbe622d82b38f9823dfd11b818.jpg ||%25mage%25 Unicorn || %25mage%25 "Best go-to for land!"  || %25mage%25My first special shape I was in for a decade of my life with The Princess.

One only needs to be attuned to that energy to listen. Markus is Sangiovanni, and the Bloodline, while oft looked down upon by some, has shown to be greatly useful to others. Their Sorcery in Necromancy is second only to the Wise and if you have use of his particular talents, he makes himself available to assist in personal and city matters. It has been said that he can pull the secrets from the dead and see what they saw in their last moments and even interact with hidden specters and spirits. %0a> %0a> !!!!%25mage%25 Occultist [---(Occult, Magic, Any)---]%0a> ->Markus can be found around the various hang outs and occult bookstores around the city. He's constantly adorned in trinkets and charms with Occult runes of protection and seen his with own library of authentic books on magic. He creates protective charms and trinkets and even artifacts that can enhance latent mystical talents and energies. He's always willing to work on a new project for the right price, or for anyone who he cares for. Often, people will need to provide their own materials, but he's more than willing to assist. He's also known to share access to his Library for the right reasons, depending on the person, and if one just asks he may be willing to help research any sort of knowledge one may need.%0a> %0a> !!!!%25mage%25 Galliard of the Dying Light [---(Vampire, Ordo Dracul)---]%0a> ->His status within the ranks of the Defiant has risen lately, and he serves as a Sworn of the Dying Light as a Galliard. His official position is to challenge the Status Quo and not let people get comfortable with how they learn and research. He finds it extremely important to view things with fresh and outside ideas, because when one gets comfortable with one way of thinking, it often ends with their minds becoming addled and spiritually rotting. In this way, he's annoyed many of the eldest of his Covenant and friends, but one could say he's always out to shake things up.%0a> %0a> !!!!%25mage%25 Lucky [---(Magic)---]%0a> ->Good luck seems to follow Markus. It's actually quite noticeable to those that are near him often. Winning lottery tickets, friends in all the right places, and generally succeeding on most anything he puts his mind to. Those that are closest to him knows he and lady luck have a special relationship, and he's willing to help those that need a little boost now and then for a fair price. If someone needs money, items, or information fast, it can't help to try and call upon the local Sorcerer to set events in motion.%0a> %0a> !!!!%25mage%25 Good with his hands [--- (Crafts, Weapons, Occult)---]%0a> ->Markus is known to be good with his hands, he's a skilled craftsman with a focus on making gifts for his friends and allies. He's made weapons, armor, and magical items to share with the people he cares for and has a particular fondness for jewelry and trinkets. If something needs repairs, modifications, or a new project started entirely Markus considered it a good use of time to spend a few days in his shop and come up with something special.%0a> %25center%25https://i.imgur.com/YHNAGVE.png%0a

"%0a> %0a> Izabella was born in china, an unwanted daughter but as luck would have it, and she was very lucky, adopted to a wealthy cuban family in Florida that were unable to have children of her own.

She saw the kid there playing with her toys as alone as she was, she ran up to her, they played together for HOURS forgetting the time, she offered Izzy one of her toys, anyone she wanted. Izzy chose a unicorn, and when she took it the child offered her hand instead. When they walked away together she left at the playground a doll that looked just like her new best friend. Her name was Grace then, grace the unicorn. They ran and jumped and played all day. The Princess cared for her, she fed her and combed her, they were inseparable. The Princess blessed her with incredible powers too, to help in their games. Rare was any of The Princess' friends more blessed than Grace the Unicorn. Somehow though, it all went wrong. Somehow the Princess left her. Somehow she was forgotten.

One only needs to be attuned to that energy to listen. Markus is Sangiovanni, and the Bloodline, while oft looked down upon by some, has shown to be greatly useful to others. Their Sorcery in Necromancy is second only to the Wise and if you have use of his particular talents, he makes himself available to assist in personal and city matters. It has been said that he can pull the secrets from the dead and see what they saw in their last moments and even interact with hidden specters and spirits. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25mage%25 Occultist [---(Occult, Magic, Any)---]%0a%3c ->Markus can be found around the various hang outs and occult bookstores around the city. He's constantly adorned in trinkets and charms with Occult runes of protection and seen his with own library of authentic books on magic. He creates protective charms and trinkets and even artifacts that can enhance latent mystical talents and energies. He's always willing to work on a new project for the right price, or for anyone who he cares for. Often, people will need to provide their own materials, but he's more than willing to assist. He's also known to share access to his Library for the right reasons, depending on the person, and if one just asks he may be willing to help research any sort of knowledge one may need.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25mage%25 Galliard of the Dying Light [---(Vampire, Ordo Dracul)---]%0a%3c ->His status within the ranks of the Defiant has risen lately, and he serves as a Sworn of the Dying Light as a Galliard. His official position is to challenge the Status Quo and not let people get comfortable with how they learn and research. He finds it extremely important to view things with fresh and outside ideas, because when one gets comfortable with one way of thinking, it often ends with their minds becoming addled and spiritually rotting. In this way, he's annoyed many of the eldest of his Covenant and friends, but one could say he's always out to shake things up.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25mage%25 Lucky [---(Magic)---]%0a%3c ->Good luck seems to follow Markus. It's actually quite noticeable to those that are near him often. Winning lottery tickets, friends in all the right places, and generally succeeding on most anything he puts his mind to. Those that are closest to him knows he and lady luck have a special relationship, and he's willing to help those that need a little boost now and then for a fair price. If someone needs money, items, or information fast, it can't help to try and call upon the local Sorcerer to set events in motion.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25mage%25 Good with his hands [--- (Crafts, Weapons, Occult)---]%0a%3c ->Markus is known to be good with his hands, he's a skilled craftsman with a focus on making gifts for his friends and allies. He's made weapons, armor, and magical items to share with the people he cares for and has a particular fondness for jewelry and trinkets. If something needs repairs, modifications, or a new project started entirely Markus considered it a good use of time to spend a few days in his shop and come up with something special.%0a%3c %25center%25https://i.imgur.com/YHNAGVE.png%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c (:div2end:)%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/819jYvIkK3L._AC_SX466_.jpg%0a%3c \%0a%3c %0a%3c ''%25mortal%25 "Your life is what your thoughts make it." - Marcus Aurelius''%0a%3c %0a%3c \%0a%3c %25vampire%25 "A wise man once said 'Men always want to be a woman's first love - women like to be a man's last romance.'...

On the other hand her tendency to wander leads her to the wildest adventures, and into the most unlikely places. Like the time she broke into unlicensed MMA fighting. Or the time she figured out shes a natural behind the wheel and started street racing and won this awesome bike. Or the time she got lost in a fetish club and forgot what a safeword was.

Izzy just can't keep her mind on anything for more than five minutes unless it's fun. She can't sit still, she can't stop and think, and she can't stick to a routine to save her life. She's tried, but can't manage to go to school and get a proper education (something someone taken as an elementary school kid could sorely need), she can't hold a steady job, and she would forget her head if it wasn't attached to her. On the other hand her tendency to wander leads her to the wildest adventures, and into the most unlikely places. Like the time she broke into unlicensed MMA fighting. Or the time she figured out shes a natural behind the wheel and started street racing and won this awesome bike. Or the time she got lost in a fetish club and forgot what a safeword was. It's almost like she is running away from something, or wants to think of anything else but what's on her mind%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=0px width=330 border='2px solid #6e68a3' margin-right=10px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=0px newwin%25 https://i.imgur.com/qj0Evtd.jpg%0a%3c %0a%3c %25changeling%25 '''''stronger than i look!

She was courted by the Summers for awhile for her strength and ferocity in the heat of a moment but she decided in the end that outside of the moments when she needed it anger just didn't taste great in her mouth. She's still game for a fight though, for missions or just for fun. Just don't blame her for getting knocked on your butt by a princess toy.

Am I the girl, the little asian girl with the cuban family that everyone sees, that dies 'her hair all those colors and wears these awesome clothes? Am i a HORSE? Am i all those other things i can be? Am i all of them at once? I don't even know anymore, I try not to think about it. Thinking about it makes me upset. IM AN IZZY! '%0a%3c %0a%3c Izabella stands out in a crowd immediately. Tall and long limbed, thin and busty, her hair and clothes in a multitude of colors and a wide easy smile she is someone you remember. Round north Chinese features are prominent in her face, which she often makes up brilliantly in sparkles and colors to match her wardrobe. Izzy walks almost a little clumsy with her limbs not quite matching her gait, not unlike seeing a young horse learning to run, its not uncommon to see her fall or stumble. %0a%3c [[%3c%3c]] %0a%3c !!! %25mortal%25 History:%0a%3c 'Please don't ask me to talk about it ok? Im a PLAYMATE. You know what that means right? My time with THEM wasn't like your time. I know the things THEY do are just awful but they were never awful to me. They liked me, we played together all day. They combed me and rode me and ran me and i was so good. I don't know why they got rid of me and forgot me, but you all helped me anyway, you didn't need to but you did. Im your friend now, all your friend. We're going to run and jump and play and I'll hit and fight and bleed to keep you here with me and stay my friend. I miss them though. I miss them everyday. Help me think of something else, help me not think at all? Whatever that's fun you want to do together im totally game but Whatever you do though don't ask me to talk about it, ok? Dont ask me to talk about THEM. "%0a%3c %0a%3c Izabella was born in china, an unwanted daughter but as luck would have it, and she was very lucky, adopted to a wealthy cuban family in Florida that were unable to have children of her own. Renamed from her original name of Qilin to Isabella Gracia she had a great childhood, her new parents were kind and loving, gave her a great education she never particularly payed attention to, and was sheltered from most of the wicked things of the world until the day THEY came for her. The day she disappeared. The day a doll was put in her place%0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=10px border='2px solid #6e68a3' width=305 margin-right=0px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=10px newwin%25 https://i.imgur.com/jSfIp2E.jpg%0a%3c %0a%3c Izzy did have a great childhood. She didn't think it was a big deal walking alone frlm school, and even though she was told not to talk to strangers she didn't think it was so bad if it was a kid like her right? She saw the kid there playing with her toys as alone as she was, she ran up to her, they played together for HOURS forgetting the time, she offered Izzy one of her toys, anyone she wanted. Izzy chose a unicorn, and when she took it the child offered her hand instead. When they walked away together she left at the playground a doll that looked just like her new best friend. Her name was Grace then, grace the unicorn. They ran and jumped and played all day. The Princess cared for her, she fed her and combed her, they were inseparable. The Princess blessed her with incredible powers too, to help in their games. Rare was any of The Princess' friends more blessed than Grace the Unicorn. Somehow though, it all went wrong. Somehow the Princess left her. Somehow she was forgotten. Izzy doesn't remember the day, perhaps it's best she doesn't.%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]] %0a%3c The Lost of Miami found her on the street and they took her in, and welcomed her as one of their own even though some of them whispered she clearly wasn't. She was a Playmate after all, they have a certain reputation. They're usually rarer in the human side of the world, because they so rarely escape or have any reason to try. They're pampered. Izzy knew it must have been the same for her, and maybe there was some sort of mistake. Maybe she got Lost, out playing and ran too far! That must be it. One day she ran, out back into the Thorns to find her way home, but no matter how hard she ran she couldn't find it. She was usually so good at finding things. One of The Princess' favorite games was hide and seek, and Grace was pretty good at finding her hiding places. She was lost in the thorns, and all hope seemed lost. She was alone, and began to hear howling. Wolves closed in, but before they could attack the freehold came again and rescued her, together they fought the dire wolves and Izzy learned too just as her rescuers how strong a unicorn could actually be, and how thrilling and amazing the heat of the fight was. It was something unlike anything at home, there was never any fighting there at all. There was never any of the pleasures she found with one of her rescuers that night either in the Princess' palace. %0a%3c %0a%3c This world had its charms she had to admit, and its people had her gratitude. She learned their stories, and the injustices they suffered and that's when she decided she would stay with them. She would play and fight and love with them, and try her best to remember what it was like to be a human as apparently they all once were. She Swore their promises and put the past in Arcadia behind her. She was helped to find who she once was, and helped destroy the doll left in her place. She cried to break something that once belonged to HER but when she did, she remembered, REALLY remembered her name. She stays with friends in the freehold now, and has the tike of her life doing it. She has to after all, every moment she pushes to be the best moment, because in those moments of awful quiet and stillness she csn almost hear the voice of a Princess. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[%3c%3c]] %0a%3c !!! %25mortal%25 Role Playing Hooks:%0a%3c ''The truth is out there. The thought reverberates inside my head, insistent and relentless. I was never a fan of the X-Files, but now I understand Muller's underlying desperation in his search for answers.

She goes through the local newspapers with a fine-tooth comb, looking for anything weird or out of place, trying to piece together evidence of paranormal phenomena. Anyone that openly entertains the notion that the supernatural might exist runs the risk of being subjected to her findings.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25mortal%25 '''''A devout member of the faith (anyone):'''''\\%0a%3c %25%25 The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. He makes me to lie down in green pastures: he leads me beside the still waters. He restores my soul: he leads me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for you are with me; your rod and your staff they comfort me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies: you anoint my head with oil; my cup runs over.

She is currently enrolled at the University of Miami, taking various classes that would enable her to pursue a career as a translator or interpreter. Recently, she has made an effort to involve herself more in the extracurricular activities offered by the university.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25mortal%25 '''''The right to bear arms (anyone):'''''\\%0a%3c %25%25 It is the God-given right of the American people to keep and bear arms; Amber often frequents gun clubs, gun shops, and firearms expositions. While unloading a clip of bullets into a paper target at the shooting range isn't going to solve any of her problems, it certainly has a way of making her feel a bit better about them. It also is a fine way of making new acquaintances.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25mortal%25 '''''Looking to make a quick buck (anyone):'''''\\%0a%3c %25%25 The list of expenditures keeps on piling high: school fees, class litteratures, rent, therapy, utilities, internet, and so on and so forth. Even with working two jobs and taking student loans, Amber is struggling to pay all her bills on time every month. Any opportunity to earn some extra money would pique her interest.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25mortal%25 '''''Something to soothe the nerves (medicine/crime):'''''\\%0a%3c %25%25 Amber returned home from from her deployment overseas bearing traumas unseen, suffering from panic attacks, chronic insomnia, and other stress-related symptoms. She has been prescribed variety of drugs by different doctors from across the state, sometimes by resorting to feigning or exaggerating ailments. Benzodiazepines, opiods, sleeping pills, and anti-depressants help her through those days when life itself just feels overwhelming. Most of the times she manages to get her prescriptions refilled by licensed doctors or pyschiatrists, but in dire situations she has resorted to more illicit methods.%0a%3c %0a%3c [[%3c%3c]] %0a%3c !!! %25mortal%25 Contacts:%0a%3c %0a%3c (:cellnr width=50%25 align=left style='padding-left: 0px;':)%0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center width=180 margin-top=0px border='2px solid #8666cc' margin-right=7px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=8px newwin%25 [[https://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/Players/SecondCircle|https://i.imgur.com/wqCxCUf.jpg]] %25beast newwin%25 [[https://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/Players/SecondCircle|'''Second Circle:''']]%0a%3c %0a%3c %25beast%25 '' "No man understands hospitality better than'' %25newwin%25 ''[[https://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/Players/JeremiahHamilton|Jeremiah]] %25beast%25 and it truly shows at the %25newwin%25 [[https://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/Players/SecondCircle|The Second Circle]]%25beast%25.
