Am I the girl, the little asian girl with the cuban family that everyone sees, that dies 'her hair all those colors and wears these awesome clothes? Am i a HORSE? Am i all those other things i can be? Am i all of them at once? I don't even know anymore, I try not to think about it. Thinking about it makes me upset. IM AN IZZY! '%0a%0aIzabella stands out in a crowd immediately. Tall and long limbed, thin and busty, her hair and clothes in a multitude of colors and a wide easy smile she is someone you remember. Round north Chinese features are prominent in her face, which she often makes up brilliantly in sparkles and colors to match her wardrobe. Izzy walks almost a little clumsy with her limbs not quite matching her gait, not unlike seeing a young horse learning to run, its not uncommon to see her fall or stumble. %0a[[%3c%3c]] %0a!!! %25changeling%25 History:%0a'Please don't ask me to talk about it ok? Im a PLAYMATE. You know what that means right? My time with THEM wasn't like your time. I know the things THEY do are just awful but they were never awful to me. They liked me, we played together all day. They combed me and rode me and ran me and i was so good. I don't know why they got rid of me and forgot me, but you all helped me anyway, you didn't need to but you did. Im your friend now, all your friend. We're going to run and jump and play and I'll hit and fight and bleed to keep you here with me and stay my friend. I miss them though. I miss them everyday. Help me think of something else, help me not think at all? Whatever that's fun you want to do together im totally game but Whatever you do though don't ask me to talk about it, ok? Dont ask me to talk about THEM. "%0a%0aIzabella was born in china, an unwanted daughter but as luck would have it, and she was very lucky, adopted to a wealthy cuban family in Florida that were unable to have children of her own. Renamed from her original name of Qilin to Isabella Gracia she had a great childhood, her new parents were kind and loving, gave her a great education she never particularly payed attention to, and was sheltered from most of the wicked things of the world until the day THEY came for her. The day she disappeared. The day a doll was put in her place%0a%25rfloat text-align=center margin-top=10px border='2px solid #6e68a3' width=305 margin-right=0px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=10px newwin%25 https://i.imgur.com/jSfIp2E.jpg%0a%0aIzzy did have a great childhood. She didn't think it was a big deal walking alone frlm school, and even though she was told not to talk to strangers she didn't think it was so bad if it was a kid like her right? She saw the kid there playing with her toys as alone as she was, she ran up to her, they played together for HOURS forgetting the time, she offered Izzy one of her toys, anyone she wanted. Izzy chose a unicorn, and when she took it the child offered her hand instead. When they walked away together she left at the playground a doll that looked just like her new best friend. Her name was Grace then, grace the unicorn. They ran and jumped and played all day. The Princess cared for her, she fed her and combed her, they were inseparable. The Princess blessed her with incredible powers too, to help in their games. Rare was any of The Princess' friends more blessed than Grace the Unicorn. Somehow though, it all went wrong. Somehow the Princess left her. Somehow she was forgotten. Izzy doesn't remember the day, perhaps it's best she doesn't.%0a[[%3c%3c]] %0aThe Lost of Miami found her on the street and they took her in, and welcomed her as one of their own even though some of them whispered she clearly wasn't. She was a Playmate after all, they have a certain reputation. They're usually rarer in the human side of the world, because they so rarely escape or have any reason to try. They're pampered. Izzy knew it must have been the same for her, and maybe there was some sort of mistake. Maybe she got Lost, out playing and ran too far! That must be it. One day she ran, out back into the Thorns to find her way home, but no matter how hard she ran she couldn't find it. She was usually so good at finding things. One of The Princess' favorite games was hide and seek, and Grace was pretty good at finding her hiding places. She was lost in the thorns, and all hope seemed lost. She was alone, and began to hear howling. Wolves closed in, but before they could attack the freehold came again and rescued her, together they fought the dire wolves and Izzy learned too just as her rescuers how strong a unicorn could actually be, and how thrilling and amazing the heat of the fight was. It was something unlike anything at home, there was never any fighting there at all. There was never any of the pleasures she found celebrating with one of her rescuers that night either in the Princess' palace. %0a%0aThis world had its charms she had to admit, and its people had her gratitude. She learned their stories, and the injustices they suffered and that's when she decided she would stay with them. She would play and fight and love with them, and try her best to remember what it was like to be a human as apparently they all once were. She Swore their promises and put the past in Arcadia behind her. She was helped to find who she once was, and helped destroy the doll left in her place. She cried to break something that once belonged to HER but when she did, she remembered, REALLY remembered her name. She stays with friends in the freehold now, and has the time of her life doing it. She has to after all, every moment she pushes to be the best moment, because in those moments of awful quiet and stillness she can almost hear the voice of a Princess. %0a%0a[[%3c%3c]] %0a!!! %25changeling %25 Role Playing Hooks:%0a''Got something to do? Im always ready for a game, or if you have one of those important missions I can come too. You know I can help right? Im strong and fast and unicorns can even heal your wounds. That's totally a thing someone told me once. Don't leave me alone or leave me behind. Its no fun when you leave, so promise?''%0a%0a%25mortal%25 '''''Easily Distracted (anyone) :''''' \\%0a%25%25 its a PROBLEM. Izzy just can't keep her mind on anything for more than five minutes unless it's fun. She can't sit still, she can't stop and think, and she can't stick to a routine to save her life. She's tried, but can't manage to go to school and get a proper education (something someone taken as an elementary school kid could sorely need), she can't hold a steady job, and she would forget her head if it wasn't attached to her. On the other hand her tendency to wander leads her to the wildest adventures, and into the most unlikely places. Like the time she broke into unlicensed MMA fighting. Or the time she figured out shes a natural behind the wheel and started street racing and won this awesome bike. Or the time she got lost in a fetish club and forgot what a safeword was. It's almost like she is running away from something, or wants to think of anything else but what's on her mind%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=0px width=330 border='2px solid #6e68a3' margin-right=10px margin-bottom=10px margin-left=0px newwin%25 https://i.imgur.com/qj0Evtd.jpg%0a%0a%0a%25mortal%25 '''''The right to bear arms?

She's tried, but can't manage to go to school and get a proper education (something someone taken as an elementary school kid could sorely need), she can't hold a steady job, and she would forget her head if it wasn't attached to her. On the other hand her tendency to wander leads her to the wildest adventures, and into the most unlikely places. Like the time she broke into unlicensed MMA fighting. Or the time she figured out shes a natural behind the wheel and started street racing and won this awesome bike. Or the time she got lost in a fetish club and forgot what a safeword was.

She saw the kid there playing with her toys as alone as she was, she ran up to her, they played together for HOURS forgetting the time, she offered Izzy one of her toys, anyone she wanted. Izzy chose a unicorn, and when she took it the child offered her hand instead. When they walked away together she left at the playground a doll that looked just like her new best friend. Her name was Grace then, grace the unicorn. They ran and jumped and played all day. The Princess cared for her, she fed her and combed her, they were inseparable. The Princess blessed her with incredible powers too, to help in their games. Rare was any of The Princess' friends more blessed than Grace the Unicorn. Somehow though, it all went wrong. Somehow the Princess left her. Somehow she was forgotten. Izzy doesn't remember the day, perhaps it's best she doesn't.%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]] %0a%3c The Lost of Miami found her on the street and they took her in, and welcomed her as one of their own even though some of them whispered she clearly wasn't. She was a Playmate after all, they have a certain reputation. They're usually rarer in the human side of the world, because they so rarely escape or have any reason to try. They're pampered. Izzy knew it must have been the same for her, and maybe there was some sort of mistake. Maybe she got Lost, out playing and ran too far! That must be it. One day she ran, out back into the Thorns to find her way home, but no matter how hard she ran she couldn't find it. She was usually so good at finding things. One of The Princess' favorite games was hide and seek, and Grace was pretty good at finding her hiding places. She was lost in the thorns, and all hope seemed lost. She was alone, and began to hear howling. Wolves closed in, but before they could attack the freehold came again and rescued her, together they fought the dire wolves and Izzy learned too just as her rescuers how strong a unicorn could actually be, and how thrilling and amazing the heat of the fight was. It was something unlike anything at home, there was never any fighting there at all. There was never any of the pleasures she found with one of her rescuers that night either in the Princess' palace. %0a%3c %0a%3c This world had its charms she had to admit, and its people had her gratitude. She learned their stories, and the injustices they suffered and that's when she decided she would stay with them. She would play and fight and love with them, and try her best to remember what it was like to be a human as apparently they all once were. She Swore their promises and put the past in Arcadia behind her. She was helped to find who she once was, and helped destroy the doll left in her place. She cried to break something that once belonged to HER but when she did, she remembered, REALLY remembered her name. She stays with friends in the freehold now, and has the tike of her life doing it. She has to after all, every moment she pushes to be the best moment, because in those moments of awful quiet and stillness she csn almost hear the voice of a Princess. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [[%3c%3c]] %0a%3c !!! %25mortal%25 Role Playing Hooks:%0a%3c ''The truth is out there.
