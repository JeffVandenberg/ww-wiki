An extensive network of connected tattoos run down both arms and over what parts of her chest are exposed. Concealed under her clothing, the ink continues to grace her form. Long black hair is usually pulled into a tight, single braid and she usually prefers to wear durable fabrics such as denim and leather, paired with sturdy boots and a black, worn out cowboy hat.%0a%0a%25white%25 In her War-form, Monica is still not as physically dominating as others of her kind, but what she lacks in size and flesh rending muscle, she makes up for in sheer brutality, and blood lust. Her coat is a mix of greys, blacks, and whites, with a small mohawk of black that runs down between her ears to her shoulder blades. Braids of black and white dangle from her head and her claws look like black onyx shimmering in the light.%0a%0a%25white%25 Monica's wolf-form does away with trinkets dangling from her fur and any concept that there is a human underneath. She maintains her war-form coloration, but the braids and mohawk disappear. Eyes are a deep shade of amber, displaying animal instinct with human cunning, and to look into her eyes is to see death itself staring back at you. %0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=25px width=250px height=350px%25https://i.imgur.com/ChT9GLi.png%0a!%25werewolf%25 History:%0aBorn in a small village on the Mexico side of the Texas border to a Cartel drug mule mother and a father she didn't know. All she knew about him is what others told her, and the story always changed...he was either a hero or the most despised thing on earth from both sides of the law, so she eventually made up her own version and stopped asking. When her mother was caught crossing the border, Monica was taken in by the new cartel growing in her region, the Zetas...a group of American-trained Mexican soldier who saw more profit in taking over the drug trade than fighting it. Some would assume her fate was one worse than death, but instead they trained her for the new generation of child soldiers. %0a%0aShe showed promise with a brutality and blood lust, they had only ever seen in their most senior killers. She was taught infiltration, assassination and adaptation and sent in alone to take out key targets and was even smuggled across the border from time to time. Her last job was when it all went wrong and she disappeared into the urban centers of Texas and remained a shadow for several years until they found her again. She refused to go back, having found a life for herself, and made sure none of them returned to report on her location. From there though, she no longer felt secure and wandered the Southwest until she found herself in Portland, thinking it was far enough away that she'd be able to make a new life.%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=250px height=350px%25https://i.imgur.com/TKYNdPe.png%0a!%25werewolf%25  Hooks:%0a%25werewolf%25'''Down Mexico Way''' (Everyone): Ever been to Mexico?

Lady-like? Not in the slightest. Does it keep her from going on a murderous rampage? Most definitely. %0a%0a%25werewolf%25'''Are You Good Enough?''' (Security/Law Enforcement): As a word-of-mouth security consultant, Monica contracts herself out as a target for security firms and law enforcement agencies to hunt down, or as a test to their systems. Is your firm good enough to stop her theft? Is your tactical unit tough enough to take her down on her own turf? She'll be the judge of that.%0a%0a%25werewolf%25'''The Messenger''' (Werewolf/Supernatural): Have a rival that muscled you out of your own turf? Want to send a message that's loud and clear?
