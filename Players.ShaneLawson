She isn't a model for sure but she is fit and generally wears baggy clothes or things that were in fashion back in the 90's. She is a throw back to what she feels was a simpler time. Still she is not opposed to some more...interesting fashions. She is a fan of the bikini top look since coming to Miami as it gives her a chance to show off her ink and abs.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Mien''%0a%0a%25center%25 Her skin becomes pale white with blue swirls through it that seems to sparkle and shift slightly as she moves along. Her hair also seems to never stop moving, sometimes it acts like it's caught in a fierce wind and other times it's a gentle breeze or ever so subtle. Her hair also becomes a stark white. Recently one can see a storm brewing behind her eyes and under her skin, he Wyrd has grown stronger and it's starting to show.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Mantle''%0a%0a%25center%25 Just like her Mien her mantle manifests in breezes.
