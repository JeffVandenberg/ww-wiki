It is located inside the home of the motley.  Deep in the basement is a little crawl space door that is big enough to accept Conall and Chris, as long as they are flexible.  It is in the northeast corner behind the boat bar. There is, of course, a special way to open the door, otherwise, it only opens into an unfinished crawl space section of the basement.  Once the pattern of knocking has been granted and the payment made, the door opens out where the Beach, redwood and jungle meet.  The door actually opens from inside one of the redwood trees, a large door shape knot has been made to accept them.%0a%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=25px margin-right=25px width=250px height=250px%25https://i.imgur.com/SiHzyVi.jpg%0aThe Island of Misfit Toys is the vast island the size of a small town.  The island itself is ringed with perfect white sandy beaches.  There are rocky caves and cliffs that break up the beach and the inside of the island.  The main part is half a rich lush jungle land, and the other half hold towering, impressive redwood trees of a vast forest.  A river runs between the forest and the jungle.  Waterfalls from bother areas feeding it, as well as the crystal clear blue ocean.  Under the water of the sea are coral reefs in every bright color imaginable.%0a%0a(:tableend:)   %0a%0a%0a(:table valign=top:)%0a(:cellnr width=700 colspan=2 align=center:)%0a%0a!! %25center%25%25color=#669966%25 The Sections%0a%0a%0a!!! %25center%25https://i.imgur.com/h1qdHt1.png%0a%0a%25color=#add8e6%25 The beaches during the day are perfect white sandy stretches of land.  Palm trees cast shade over the sand.  It's a perfect place to lay out and bask in the sun, soaking up the rays.  The warm water comes up and laps over the sand in waves.  On the west side of the island, larger waves come crashing in for surfing.  The rest of the island has more gentle waves that roll in and lap at the shore.  Birds fly over head, little crab hobs shuffle around keeping the sand clean.  Sometimes Seal hobs bask on the rocks near the caves after eating.%0a%0a!!!! %25center%25%25color=#add8e6%25Gallery%0a||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/Q4FsEi9.png|https://i.imgur.com/Q4FsEi9.png]]||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/AQE4MZe.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/AQE4MZe.jpg]]||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/BjxwzYo.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/BjxwzYo.jpg]]||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/VFyK7C7.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/VFyK7C7.jpg]]||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/xxiN1JR.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/xxiN1JR.jpg]]||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/L8vIomu.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/L8vIomu.jpg]]||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/p9GCsUC.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/p9GCsUC.jpg]]||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/KLlfScP.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/KLlfScP.jpg]]||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/phg1mPz.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/phg1mPz.jpg]]||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/7v4h91I.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/7v4h91I.jpg]]||%0a||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/OOOyPiH.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/OOOyPiH.jpg]]||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/2mbhqkc.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/2mbhqkc.jpg]]||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/goHtLaT.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/goHtLaT.jpg]]||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/vgxRGaL.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/vgxRGaL.jpg]]||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/15Xyyr8.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/15Xyyr8.jpg]]||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/h3snm4o.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/h3snm4o.jpg]]||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/8Gamm6g.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/8Gamm6g.jpg]]||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/5fybAl6.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/5fybAl6.jpg]]||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/bTiWPcv.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/bTiWPcv.jpg]]||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/DEmyUXb.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/DEmyUXb.jpg]]||%0a||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/Q0Pio76.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/Q0Pio76.jpg]]||%25thumb%25[[https://i.imgur.com/KJDKEc3.jpg|https://i.imgur.com/KJDKEc3.jpg]]||%25thumb%25[[|]]||%25thumb%25[[|]]||%25thumb%25[[|]]||%25thumb%25[[|]]||%25thumb%25[[|]]||%25thumb%25[[|]]||%25thumb%25[[|]]||%25thumb%25[[|]]||%0a%0a!!! %25center%25https://i.imgur.com/CNbIDDn.png%0a%0a%25red%25 All along the shore, there are caves in the cliffs that set the boundary between the beach and the rest of the island.

XX) represents a mundane-but-secure lair outside the Hedge, Hollow is your character’s secret, private bit of real estate inside the Hedge. It may be something as simple a closet door that opens into a quiet, hollowed-out tree, or as elaborate a knock that opens any unlocked door into a lavish, gothic mansion. These locations can be as varied as the Hedge itself.%0a%0aThese pockets of personal or inherited reality have been trimmed of any thorns that might cause their owners trouble. With few exceptions (see below), these faerie safe houses are tied to a single, consistent physical entrance into the Hedge, but being part of the Hedge means they don’t need to conform to available space. In any case, the Hollow belongs to your character or her motley and has some innate protection from intrusion.%0a%0aWhile a changeling is inside her Hollow, the Merit’s rating is subtracted from any attempts to learn her personal information, as if she had the Anonymity merit at an equal rating. Attempts to pursue or track her, both supernatural and mundane, are hindered by the same penalty. Should she be discovered, the entrance to the Hollow can only be forced open by an entity whose Wyrd exceeds the Merit’s rating. Even then, one of the Hollow’s owners (even if no one is present) can resist intrusion with Resolve + Hollow versus the intruder’s Wyrd. A day and a night must pass before the intruder can try again.%0a%0a:%25color=#669966%25Size Matters ••%25%25: Without purchasing this enhancement, the Hollow is only big enough for two changelings to sleep comfortably. With one purchase, a motley of five to six changelings has enough room to exist without immediate cabin fever. The second purchase turns the Hollow into a vast estate or small town, and members of a motley might not even see each other for the duration of a stay.%0a%0a:%25color=#006400%25Hob Alarm%25%25: A group of somewhat friendly hobs have taken refuge in the character’s Hollow. They react poorly to any sign of intruders. While within her Hollow, a character cannot be Denied her Defense due to surprise and adds her Hollow to the dice pools all actions during the first turn of combat. Maintaining the presence of these hobs requires a frequent quid-pro-quo that errs on the surprisingly honest side of hob deals.%0a%0a(:tableend:)   %0a%0a(:include GameRef.Directorycity:)

A lush tropical area that covers half the center of the island.  There are tall big leafed trees and bushes.  Vines connected all around.  The trees are massive with large twisting branches, big enough to support the weight of the big tiger that roams the area.

It's a perfect place to lay out and bask in the sun, soaking up the rays.  The warm water comes up and laps over the sand in waves.  On the west side of the island, larger waves come crashing in for surfing.  The rest of the island has more gentle waves that roll in and lap at the shore.  Birds fly over head, little crab hobs shuffle around keeping the sand clean.  Sometimes Seal hobs bask on the rocks near the caves after eating.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> %25color=#add8e6%25 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

It is located inside the home of the motley.  Deep in the basement is a little crawl space door that is big enough to accept Conall and Chris, as long as they are flexible.  It is in the northeast corner behind the boat bar. There is, of course, a special way to open the door, otherwise, it only opens into an unfinished crawl space section of the basement.  Once the pattern of knocking has been granted and the payment made, the door opens out where the Beach, redwood and jungle meet.  The door actually opens from inside one of the redwood trees, a large door shape knot has been made to accept them.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=25px margin-right=25px width=250px height=250px%25https://i.imgur.com/SiHzyVi.jpg%0a%3c The Island of Misfit Toys is the vast island the size of a small town.

The main part is half a rich lush jungle land, and the other half hold towering, impressive redwood trees of a vast forest.  A river runs between the forest and the jungle.  Waterfalls from bother areas feeding it, as well as the crystal clear blue ocean.
