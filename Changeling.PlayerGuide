The exception is if you specifically note you’re trying to gain the Hedge Denizen condition ahead of time, in which case Debt is only spent by staff normally. Note current Debt in the Conditions section of your sheet.%0a*Goblin Contracts always cost 2xp, period, and should be balanced appropriately. This means they currently require 2 Justifications to create with the Custom Item/Power system.%0a%0a[[#top |back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25'''Ensorcellment'''%0a'''The changeling can ensorcel a number of individuals equal to half their wyrd rounded up.'''%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0aEnsorcelling someone is a dangerous prospect initially but they quickly become a benefit and a companion that also sees the world through their eyes.  They become the agents of the Lost on the ironside and can often help bring about the goals of their changeling patrons.  Ensorcelled also are able to earn court goodwill to their patron’s court due to the fact that they’re considered tied to the changeling through the wyrd.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0aUnfortunately this also makes the ensorcelled person into something of a target for the huntsman.  The changeling’s personal huntsman is likely to try to capture the ensorcelled person and use them to draw the changeling into a trap. %0a[[%3c%3c]]%0aEnsorcelled individuals will always bare some sort of personal mark that ties them to their patron.  This is identifiable by other changelings and acts similarly to a signature: fae know instinctively who’s marked them.  It can be anything from a strange tattoo, scar, brand, matching eye color to their patron, or other more wild options.  Only fae entities can see the brand and it reacts to the patron’s mask strength only; if their patron has reinforced the mask the mark can be hidden from fae eyes. [[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Cost: One glamour''%0a%0aThe ensorcelled must consume the offered glamour in some way.  This can take the form of infusing a drink with magic, offering enhanced blood to a vampire, or giving over a small piece of cake labeled “eat me.”  As a boon this only has the cost of one glamour.  As a blessing this cost rises by one extra glamour.  The person to be ensorcelled must be willing or the result is a wyrd hex instead [[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Wyrd Boon''%0a%0aThe ensorcelled person sees past the mask of all fae entities while also seeing the world of the%0astrange around them.  They can also see hedge gates but can not activate them. The ensorcelled is considered to have a wyrd of zero for the purposes of carrying goblin fruit or oddments but they may benefit from them as a changeling does.  And lastly they can participate in oaths with another changeling or changelings although they can never share a kith blessing in return. [[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Wyrd Blessing''%0a%0aThe ensorcelled person must have been subject to the wyrd boon before.  Again the mask must be dropped in order to impart this powerful blessing.  The ensorcelled person sees past the mask of all fae entities while also seeing the world of the strange around them.  They can also see hedge gates but can’t activate them.  The ensorcelled is considered to have a wyrd of 1 for the purposes of carrying goblin fruit or oddments and they may benefit from them as a changeling does aside from any fruits that allow them to gain glamour.  An ensorcelled person can be part of an oath with another changeling. [[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0aAdditionally the ensorcelled person can be fed on with a return of 2 glamour per 1 willpower. Harvesting in this way is an addicting experience for the ensorcelled person.  They can also activate hedgespun items without penalty using a point of willpower but tokens behave normally requiring their catch to be met. [[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Wyrd Corruption''%0a%0aThe wyrd is always a double edged thing and a changeling can deepen the bond of ensorcellment even further.  This requires the ensorcelled to be a mortal.  At wyrd 6 the changeling can grant the mortal the benefits of wyrd blessing while also granting them their kith rather than their seeming.  They’re considered fae touched at this point and their promise is related to their patron rather than a stolen mortal. Upon corrupting a mortal the changeling suffers an automatic breaking point as they damage the person’s soul.  Elsewhere, perhaps the changeling’s keeper smiles a touch.  [[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Wyrd Hex:''%0a%0aIf ensorcellment is cast on an unwilling person the result is a hex from the wyrd.  This grants the bewitched condition at the persistent level.  This effect doesn’t cost any glamour.  Hexed individuals are likely to congregate with other hexed individuals and often become hunters as the hex tears apart their lives. [[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[#top |back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25'''Exotic Airs (• to •••••)'''%0a%0aThe following rules are a temporary replacement for the missing ‘Exotic Airs’ merit in the Playtest%0a%0aEffect: Your character can harvest the emotions of some of the stranger creatures of the World of Darkness. Each dot of this Merit allows your character to gain Glamour from one type of supernatural creature. This may mean werewolves, ghosts, mummies, zombies, or stranger things still. The Glamour works the same way as if it had been harvested from a mortal. This DOES allow such characters to be Reaped, as well, but they may inherently make a roll to determine the source, and add their Supernatural Tolerance to it. %0a%0aDrawback: This advantage does not inherently mean the character is (more) able to interact with the chosen subject. For example, ghosts exist in an ethereal state, and their emotions tend to be dead and blunted. If you take this Merit, work with your Storyteller to determine how your character might harvest from these monsters. %0a%0a[[#top |back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25'''Clarification: Changeling Hours'''%0a%0aWhen used on living things, Rewind the Clock doesn’t generally do much (unless counteracting similar age-based damaging powers), and Speed the Clock does bashing damage.%0a%0aThe fairest benefit affects all living supernaturals normally. Vampires (and other immortal/undead beings) are unaffected by Rewind or Speed the clock, but can be affected by Freeze the Clock. A Resolve + Wyrd contested roll is added in for freeze the clock.%0a%0a[[#top |back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25'''Playtest Documents'''%0a%0aChangeling 2ed is still in development and as part of the open playtest process, large sections of rules have been made available to the community. SashaH is currently working on keeping a PDF version for our use in 6.0.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Playtest Compilation V.6''%0a%0a*[[https://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=958&t=51964&p=42029&hilit=book#p42029|Playtest PDF]] - Updated by SashaH as she develops it.  New Versions will always be found in the link%0a%0a!!%25center%25'''Clarification: Cloak of Elements, Control Elements, etc'''%0a%0aElemental contracts require an element be chosen with the purchase. An elemental affinity that lets you manifest or control two elements gives you the second for free, and that affinity is a cheap way to buy a second element for others, too.%0a%0aFor Phantom Glory’s Elemental affinity, it can be purchased multiple times for new elements (only the first is free for Elementals).%0a%0a!!%25center%25'''Freehold of Three Pillars'''%0a%0aJoining a freehold or court is a formal Societal Oath. An oath is a permanent binding and cannot be undone. Breaking the oath merely changes the parameters of the oath, it does not erase it. By joining a freehold or court, the changeling is choosing to define herself by the oath. In swearing and keeping Societal Oath to the freehold the changeling becomes ingrained in the supernatural landscape of the area and gains +1 to navigating the local hedge. Upon swearing an Oath to a Court, she gains 1 dot of Court Mantle.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Mantles within the Mien''%0a*The mantle manifests as a minor wash of color, scent or flavor in the changeling’s mien.%0a*The mantle may now occasionally manifest a visible element, plant, or other symbol of the Court around them, particularly when using Court contracts or feeling their Court emotion.%0a*A pure embodiment of the Court, the character’s Mantle frequently flows out around the changeling and touches the miens and Mantles of others around her. This is a descriptive and not a mechanical effect, and only sensed by those who can see the character’s mien.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''The Crowns''%0a%0aThe leader of each Court has access to an additional advantage. Monarchs may apply the Charmed condition on as many people per session as they have dots in Mantle.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Court of Gristle''%0a*Courtiers gain +2 to social rolls when standing their ground in a social situation.%0a*Courtiers gain a dot of the Goblin Vow Merit (Bones).%0a*Courtiers gain two dots of Resources.%0a*Courtiers refine their Court Approach and may prioritize a single Court Approach related to how they fulfill the ideals and story of the Court. Huntsmen cannot benefit from a Court Approach unless they fulfill this Approach first.%0a*Each Courtier gains three dots of Potent Kith.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Court of Beirut''%0a*Each Courtier gains +2 to social rolls in a spontaneous gathering.%0a*Courtiers gain a dot of the Goblin Vow Merit (Color Black)%0a*Courtiers gain the Fixer merit as someone in the court can always point the courtier in the right direction.%0a*Courtiers refine their Court Approach and may prioritize a single Court Approach related to how they fulfill the ideals and story of the Court. Huntsmen cannot benefit from a Court Approach unless they fulfill this Approach first.%0a*Each courtier gains three dots of Aura Reading as she perceives the flow of the Wyrd through the world.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Court of Fortean''%0a*Courtier gains +2 to rolls involving a single mental specialty of their choice.%0a*Courtiers gain a dot of the Goblin Vow Merit (Whispered Secrets)%0a*Courtiers gain two dots of Library in their choice of Mental Skill. This merit represents the Fortean’s contributions and access to the Court’s library, and is shared with any other Forteans who have merited access. The Fortean *Library becomes increasingly cooperative with Courtiers who are tied more closely to its ideals, and it provides a bonus equal to Mantle to all appropriate research rolls.%0a*Courtiers refine their Court Approach and may prioritize a single Court Approach related to how they fulfill the ideals and story of the Court. Huntsmen cannot benefit from a Court Approach unless they fulfill this Approach first.%0a*The character’s Mantle is tightly controlled and rarely reaches out away from the changeling unless something strikes the courtier’s curiosity. Even when she drops her Mask it remains well controlled and each Courtier gains three dots of Dull Beacon.%0a%0a[[#top |back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25'''Approved Custom Items and Traits'''%0a%0a(:include GameRef.CustomItemsAndPowers#from3#to3:)%0a%0a[[#top |back to top]]%0a%0a(:include GameRef.Directorychangeling:)

The ensorcelled is considered to have a wyrd of zero for the purposes of carrying goblin fruit or oddments but they may benefit from them as a changeling does.  And lastly they can participate in oaths with another changeling or changelings although they can never share a kith blessing in return. [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c '''Wyrd Blessing:''' The ensorcelled person must have been subject to the wyrd boon before.  Again the mask must be dropped in order to impart this powerful blessing.  The ensorcelled person sees past the mask of all fae entities while also seeing the world of the strange around them.  They can also see hedge gates but can’t activate them.  The ensorcelled is considered to have a wyrd of 1 for the purposes of carrying goblin fruit or oddments and they may benefit from them as a changeling does aside from any fruits that allow them to gain glamour.  An ensorcelled person can be part of an oath with another changeling. [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c Additionally the ensorcelled person can be fed on with a return of 2 glamour per 1 willpower. Harvesting in this way is an addicting experience for the ensorcelled person.  They can also activate hedgespun items without penalty using a point of willpower but tokens behave normally requiring their catch to be met. [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c '''Wyrd Corruption:''' The wyrd is always a double edged thing and a changeling can deepen the bond of ensorcellment even further.  This requires the ensorcelled to be a mortal.  At wyrd 6 the changeling can grant the mortal the benefits of wyrd blessing while also granting them their kith rather than their seeming.  They’re considered fae touched at this point and their promise is related to their patron rather than a stolen mortal. Upon corrupting a mortal the changeling suffers an automatic breaking point as they damage the person’s soul.  Elsewhere, perhaps the changeling’s keeper smiles a touch.  [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c '''Wyrd Hex:''' If ensorcellment is cast on an unwilling person the result is a hex from the wyrd.  This grants the bewitched condition at the persistent level.  This effect doesn’t cost any glamour.  Hexed individuals are likely to congregate with other hexed individuals and often become hunters as the hex tears apart their lives.

The Cat’s Eye is a piece of jewelry, set with a stunning amber alexandrite with chatoyancy, creating a cat’s eye effect. Exposure of the gemstone to the wild magic of the fae brings a measure of the story to the gemstones, bringing a measure of feline to the gem, and to the wearer. %0a> %0a> Those who wear the adornment can use Animal Ken in place of Athletics, transforming one’s affinity for cats into physical manifestation, moving a bit more like a cat than a human. With ST approval, this can also apply to an Expression roll while dancing. This does not apply to magic power invocations, nor for any xp purchase prerequisites. To use the cat’s eye, the wearer simply has to openly display the gemstone on their person - if covered (such as by clothing) or the gem removed from the setting, the token cannot be used or, if active, ceases to function. The gemstone must be worn as part of a jewelry piece, and can be transferred to new settings and trinkets without ruining its magic. %0a> %0a> There is a small ritual involved to activate the gemstone, primarily taking a bit of time to put it on, making sure it lays right, and then brushing a hand over the stone itself last (taking at least two Instant Actions, making it nonviable during combat). The token remains active as long as the ornament is worn (for purposes of Clash of Wills, this counts as a year). Once removed, it must be activated again through the accompanying ritual.%0a> %0a> Action: Instant%0a> %0a> Mein: When active, the Eye actually blinks and looks around, the chatoyancy shifting as it observes the surroundings. The iris gains depth and appears alive, the pupil expands and contracts with lighting, though no sclera is present. Drawback: Using human tools suffers an untrained penalty to use (&#8722;1 if using a physical or social skill, &#8722;3 if using a mental skill). In short, the effect of the cat’s eye makes it more difficult to use objects primarily intended for humans; objects or equipment that can apply to animals can be used without penalty. %0a> %0a> Catch: The wearer can activate the token without a roll or glamour by simply walking around on all fours. However, the human body is not built to act on all fours, leading to developing pained muscles. Each use inflicts a cumulative &#8722;2 penalty to any action after use, as if a wound penalty. This cannot be offset by any merit or ability. The penalty is reduced by 1 per night’s rest.%0a> %0a> %0a> *Elemental Bow (••••)%0a> %0a> Public/Private: Public%0a> %0a> Abilities:The Elemental Bow is a large, ornate looking bow that’s often carried without any apparent ammunition, unless of course one plans to use it among mundane audiences. Upon activation, however, the bow alights in a chosen element (the options being fire, ice, electricity, and shadow), and upon the string being drawn back, will form an arrow of that element to be fired, for the rest of the scene, doing damage appropriate to the bow’s base stats (chosen from mundane options), but in addition having any additional effect that element might have; fire arrows may cause flammable materials to catch on fire, for instance. %0a> %0a> In addition, when already active, the user may reflexively reactive the object to change the element, rather than needing a standard action to do so, allowing for themn to swap easily between the chosen elements in the thick of things. %0a> %0a> Action: Standard, reflexive if already active.%0a> %0a> Mein: This large looking black bow doesn’t appear to be a real bow for combat, it’s long thin black piece has a thin line for the string. It has an opening in the middle where the arrows are presumably shot from. %0a> Drawback:For 24 hours the user opens themselves to the element; they take 1 extra level of damage from any manifestation of the chosen element, and a &#8722;1 penalty to hindrances caused by it.%0a> %0a> Catch:The bow explodes with power, causing it’s wielder damage, the user rolls the weapon rating, (4, in this case), and takes the successes as lethal damage, minimum of 1 lethal. As well, the user takes an environmental tilt for the scene corresponding to the element activated. The damage does not stack with a ‘re-activation’, but the user WILL suffer multiple tilts, in that case.%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a

With ST approval, this can also apply to an Expression roll while dancing. This does not apply to magic power invocations, nor for any xp purchase prerequisites. To use the cat’s eye, the wearer simply has to openly display the gemstone on their person - if covered (such as by clothing) or the gem removed from the setting, the token cannot be used or, if active, ceases to function. The gemstone must be worn as part of a jewelry piece, and can be transferred to new settings and trinkets without ruining its magic. %0a> There is a small ritual involved to activate the gemstone, primarily taking a bit of time to put it on, making sure it lays right, and then brushing a hand over the stone itself last (taking at least two Instant Actions, making it nonviable during combat). The token remains active as long as the ornament is worn (for purposes of Clash of Wills, this counts as a year). Once removed, it must be activated again through the accompanying ritual.%0a> Action: Instant%0a239d355%0a%3c %0a241,244c357%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c *Elemental Bow (••••)%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Elemental Bow (••••)%0a246d358%0a%3c %0a248d359%0a%3c %0a250d360%0a%3c %0a252d361%0a%3c %0a255d363%0a%3c %0a

So, until the book is published with those rules, a given changeling may ‘upkeep’ 1 ensorcelled mortal (or supernatural), the ensorcellment of which is assumed to happen in downtime for the time being.%0a%3c Please avoid calling it a pledge or similar because we don’t know for certain if that’s how it works.%0a%3c [&#8593; back to top]%0a%3c %0a%3c Exotic Airs (• to •••••)%0a%3c The following rules are a temporary replacement for the missing ‘Exotic Airs’ merit in the Playtest%0a%3c Effect: Your character can harvest the emotions of some of the stranger creatures of the World of Darkness. Each dot of this Merit allows your character to gain Glamour from one type of supernatural creature. This may mean werewolves, ghosts, mummies, zombies, or stranger things still. The Glamour works the same way as if it had been harvested from a mortal. This DOES allow such characters to be Reaped, as well, but they may inherently make a roll to determine the source, and add their Supernatural Tolerance to it. %0a%3c Drawback: This advantage does not inherently mean the character is (more) able to interact with the chosen subject. For example, ghosts exist in an ethereal state, and their emotions tend to be dead and blunted. If you take this Merit, work with your Storyteller to determine how your character might harvest from these monsters.

An elemental affinity that lets you manifest or control two elements gives you the second for free, and that affinity is a cheap way to buy a second element for others, too.%0a%3c For Phantom Glory’s Elemental affinity, it can be purchased multiple times for new elements (only the first is free for Elementals).%0a%3c Freehold of Three Pillars%0a%3c Joining a freehold or court is a formal Societal Oath. An oath is a permanent binding and cannot be undone. Breaking the oath merely changes the parameters of the oath, it does not erase it. By joining a freehold or court, the changeling is choosing to define herself by the oath. In swearing and keeping Societal Oath to the freehold the changeling becomes ingrained in the supernatural landscape of the area and gains +1 to navigating the local hedge. Upon swearing an Oath to a Court, she gains 1 dot of Court Mantle.%0a%3c %0a%3c Mantles within the Mien%0a%3c The mantle manifests as a minor wash of color, scent or flavor in the changeling’s mien.%0a%3c The mantle may now occasionally manifest a visible element, plant, or other symbol of the Court around them, particularly when using Court contracts or feeling their Court emotion.%0a%3c A pure embodiment of the Court, the character’s Mantle frequently flows out around the changeling and touches the miens and Mantles of others around her. This is a descriptive and not a mechanical effect, and only sensed by those who can see the character’s mien.%0a%3c The Crowns%0a%3c The leader of each Court has access to an additional advantage.

The Cat’s Eye is a piece of jewelry, set with a stunning amber alexandrite with chatoyancy, creating a cat’s eye effect. Exposure of the gemstone to the wild magic of the fae brings a measure of the story to the gemstones, bringing a measure of feline to the gem, and to the wearer. %0a%3c Those who wear the adornment can use Animal Ken in place of Athletics, transforming one’s affinity for cats into physical manifestation, moving a bit more like a cat than a human. With ST approval, this can also apply to an Expression roll while dancing. This does not apply to magic power invocations, nor for any xp purchase prerequisites. To use the cat’s eye, the wearer simply has to openly display the gemstone on their person - if covered (such as by clothing) or the gem removed from the setting, the token cannot be used or, if active, ceases to function. The gemstone must be worn as part of a jewelry piece, and can be transferred to new settings and trinkets without ruining its magic. %0a%3c There is a small ritual involved to activate the gemstone, primarily taking a bit of time to put it on, making sure it lays right, and then brushing a hand over the stone itself last (taking at least two Instant Actions, making it nonviable during combat). The token remains active as long as the ornament is worn (for purposes of Clash of Wills, this counts as a year). Once removed, it must be activated again through the accompanying ritual.%0a%3c Action: Instant%0a%3c Mein: When active, the Eye actually blinks and looks around, the chatoyancy shifting as it observes the surroundings. The iris gains depth and appears alive, the pupil expands and contracts with lighting, though no sclera is present. Drawback: Using human tools suffers an untrained penalty to use (&#8722;1 if using a physical or social skill, &#8722;3 if using a mental skill). In short, the effect of the cat’s eye makes it more difficult to use objects primarily intended for humans; objects or equipment that can apply to animals can be used without penalty. %0a%3c Catch: The wearer can activate the token without a roll or glamour by simply walking around on all fours. However, the human body is not built to act on all fours, leading to developing pained muscles. Each use inflicts a cumulative &#8722;2 penalty to any action after use, as if a wound penalty. This cannot be offset by any merit or ability. The penalty is reduced by 1 per night’s rest.%0a%3c Elemental Bow (••••)%0a%3c Public/Private: Public%0a%3c Abilities:The Elemental Bow is a large, ornate looking bow that’s often carried without any apparent ammunition, unless of course one plans to use it among mundane audiences. Upon activation, however, the bow alights in a chosen element (the options being fire, ice, electricity, and shadow), and upon the string being drawn back, will form an arrow of that element to be fired, for the rest of the scene, doing damage appropriate to the bow’s base stats (chosen from mundane options), but in addition having any additional effect that element might have; fire arrows may cause flammable materials to catch on fire, for instance. %0a%3c In addition, when already active, the user may reflexively reactive the object to change the element, rather than needing a standard action to do so, allowing for themn to swap easily between the chosen elements in the thick of things. %0a%3c Action: Standard, reflexive if already active.%0a%3c Mein: This large looking black bow doesn’t appear to be a real bow for combat, it’s long thin black piece has a thin line for the string. It has an opening in the middle where the arrows are presumably shot from. %0a%3c Drawback:For 24 hours the user opens themselves to the element; they take 1 extra level of damage from any manifestation of the chosen element, and a &#8722;1 penalty to hindrances caused by it.%0a%3c Catch:The bow explodes with power, causing it’s wielder damage, the user rolls the weapon rating, (4, in this case), and takes the successes as lethal damage, minimum of 1 lethal. As well, the user takes an environmental tilt for the scene corresponding to the element activated. The damage does not stack with a ‘re-activation’, but the user WILL suffer multiple tilts, in that case.%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
