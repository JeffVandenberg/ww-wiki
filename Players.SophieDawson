She loves to wear bright colors and little black dresses. She often wears cute eye glasses but sometimes uses contact lenses. She can easily been seen in casual wear such as jeans and t-shirts too. She's very versatile in her appearance. She is an attractive girl and she's not afraid to use it when she wants, which is often hand in hand with her intelligence. %0a(:cellnr width=500 align=left:) Personality wise, she's a pretty curious and intelligent ambivert who loves being around other people's energy and having her own space to recharge her batteries in equal measure. She is ambitious in everything she does but also feels the need to lie on a regular basis to keep her two lives, the hacker and the Emissary, separate. Being exposed to the supernatural in her college years has transformed her teenage 'defender of the bullied' attitude into a genuine desire to see the supernatural world coexist with the mortal world. %0a%0a(:tableend:)   %0a%0a%0a----%0a!!%25center%25%25mortal%25The Social Network%0a%0a|| %25thumb%25http://i67.tinypic.com/107j9z7.png || %25mage%25[[AutumnAionAverlane|Autumn]] || Older Sister || She's always looking out for me, she's like the sister I never had. || %0a|| %25thumb%25http://i66.tinypic.com/1iof3r.png || %25mortal%25[[AppleMcKinley|Apple]] || Casual Friend || She's a great cook and a fun friend. || %0a|| %25thumb%25http://i65.tinypic.com/a2zvgy.png || %25vampire%25[[LoreleiBowen|Lorelei]] || Social Acquaintance || I'm not really close to Lorelei but she's super fun to hang with. ||%0a|| %25thumb%25http://i63.tinypic.com/29bk5cl.png || %25mage%25[[CharlesDivianPeterson|Divian]] || Older Brother || He's a great buddy and someone who I know has my back. ||%0a|| %25thumb%25http://i68.tinypic.com/r9n9fp.png || %25vampire%25[[NathanialHawkins|Nate]] || Friends With Benefits || There's a lot going on here. || %0a|| %25thumb%25http://i63.tinypic.com/2jg9ye1.png || %25vampire%25[[HarveyWallson|Harvey]] || Respected Ally || Someone whose advice and insight I respect a lot. || %0a|| %25thumb%25http://i64.tinypic.com/6eklrc.jpg || %25mortal%25[[EssenceCorvin|Essence]] || Guild Mentor || A total sweetheart, she’s really become someone I look up to. || %0a|| %25thumb%25http://i64.tinypic.com/2m3iutd.jpg || %25mortal%25[[DavidErikson|David]] || Secret Keeper || Our bond is like no other.
