You must attend at least one meeting every four months  to maintain your membership. (Goal is to have a meeting once a month or every other month)\\%0a4. While we have fun, we do not play for fun.

What you might not know is that the rich get bored. There’s only so much you can do with you money before you’ve done it all. That’s where the High Rollers offer to alleviate some of that boredom. While money gives you an edge, you don’t need to be rolling in dough to gain membership. If another member vouches for you, then you are given a chance.  %0a%3c %0a%3c Their primary meeting place is the basement of the Crimson Crown casino, which is owned and operated by Esme Wallson. Whether you’re looking to take a risky bet, get an adrenaline rush, or leap out of your comfort zone - the High Rollers get up to all of it.

Benefit - Choose a single skill. Any rolls made with this skill exceptionally succeed on 3 successes instead of 5. Additionally, once per scene you may choose to automatically succeed on a roll involving your chosen skill. Drawback: The next roll you make must be rolled as a chance die. ||%0a%3c *As part of earning the 5th dot in this MCI, the member must touch the skull of Andrew Vandenberg. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25color=#008080%25'''Deeds'''%0a%3c %0a%3c *Example%0a%3c *Example%0a%3c *Example%0a%3c *Example%0a%3c *Example%0a%3c *Example%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25'''%25color=#008080%25Contact''' \\%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25 Raeras/[[Esme Wallson]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:cellnr width=100%25:)%0a%3c !%25center%25%25color=#008080%25'''Quotes'''%0a%3c %0a%3c %25mortal%25 ''"I am a quote!
