As Kindred evangelists, they focus on bringing new Kindred into the church or failing that, brining about a spiritual awakening in members of the other more temporal covenants (and thus at least partially aligning them with the Church).  The group uses both personal one on one methods and large, lively services to spread their message of the peace and resolve that only a knowing your divine purpose can bring.   %0a> %0a> !!!!%25vampire%25 ''Tollison Creed Ascends (Lancea):''  %0a> The Tollison Creed is recognized and tolerated within the Lancea, but it currently is the least important of the three major creeds.  The Revival seeks to change that.  Whether its to bring an end to "the last remnants of mortal papist influences" or simply part of a larger power play isn't always clear.  The coterie is happy to work with other Lancea regardless of Creed, but as they attract more and more members, they fully intend to convert those numbers into position, influence, and power within the Second Estate.%0a> %0a> !!!!%25vampire%25 ''In The World, Even If Not Of It (Kindred):'' %0a> Not all of the group's focus is purely on the divine.  The Kindred of the Revival live in the world of danse macabre and it would be perilous to ignore that fact.  Fortunately, as they cast a wide net in their evangelizing efforts, it allows them to cast an equally wide net for influence.  They are interested in seeing members gain influence in all the mortal spheres.  Such diversity allows them to better help each other and potential new recruits.  And makes them attractive allies to the other, more temporal factions of Miami's Kindred.  %0a> %0a77a79,80%0a> %0a> "And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.” - Mark 16:17-18%0a

The grounds provide ample parking and a few picnic tables for after-service gatherings. There is also an area in the back of the property that can be used for outdoors services in nicer weather.  Additionally in the back of the property, opposite the outdoor service area, is a matching house  - presumably where the preacher resides. %0a%3c %0a%3c '''Public Effects'''%0a%3c %0a%3c * Safe Place: 3%0a%3c * Haven: 3%0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c (:div2end:)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25vampire%25'''Members'''%0a%3c ||! %25vampire%25Image ||! %25vampire%25Name ||! %25vampire%25Role ||! %25vampire%25Comment ||! %25vampire%25Ringtone ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/eH7l3lo.png || %25vampire%25[[Players.JerryLakin|Brother Jerry]] || %25vampire%25Preacher || %25vampire%25Preacher, ringleader, and protective shepherd of his flock, Brother Jerry is the founder of the Revival. || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25vampire%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/eH7l3lo.png || %25vampire%25[[Players.Ezekiel|Brother Zeke]] || %25vampire%25Security || %25vampire%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25vampire%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/eH7l3lo.png || %25vampire%25[[Players.DariaMallory|Sister Daria ]] || %25vampire%25Theologian || %25vampire%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25vampire%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/eH7l3lo.png || %25vampire%25[[Players.GracieHamel|Gracie Hamel]] || %25vampire%25Councilor || %25vampire%25A listening ear, a shoulder to cry on, the nicest vampire you'll ever meet.

As Kindred evangelists, they focus on bringing new Kindred into the church or failing that, brining about a spiritual awakening in members of the other more temporal covenants (and thus at least partially aligning them with the Church).  The group uses both personal one on one methods and large, lively services to spread their message of the peace and resolve that only a knowing your divine purpose can bring.   %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25vampire%25 ''Tollison Creed Ascends (Lancea):''  %0a%3c The Tollison Creed is recognized and tolerated within the Lancea, but it currently is the least important of the three major creeds.  The Revival seeks to change that.  Whether its to bring an end to "the last remnants of mortal papist influences" or simply part of a larger power play isn't always clear.  The coterie is happy to work with other Lancea regardless of Creed, but as they attract more and more members, they fully intend to convert those numbers into position, influence, and power within the Second Estate.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25vampire%25 ''In The World, Even If Not Of It (Kindred):'' %0a%3c Not all of the group's focus is purely on the divine.  The Kindred of the Revival live in the world of danse macabre and it would be perilous to ignore that fact.  Fortunately, as they cast a wide net in their evangelizing efforts, it allows them to cast an equally wide net for influence.  They are interested in seeing members gain influence in all the mortal spheres.  Such diversity allows them to better help each other and potential new recruits.  And makes them attractive allies to the other, more temporal factions of Miami's Kindred.  %0a%3c %0a%3c    %0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c (:div2end:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a%3c %0a%3c (:cellnr width=100%25:)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25vampire%25'''Quotes'''%0a%3c %0a%3c "And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.” - Mark 16:17-18%0a%3c %0a%3c %25mortal%25 "I am a quote!
