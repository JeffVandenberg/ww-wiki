A well-kept parking lot off the highway leads to the farm’s produce and product store and the visiting centre, with employee housing in a bunkhouse and single or two-bedroom prefabricated housing. A comfortable, well-appointed medical clinic staffed around the clock is maintained nearby as well. Beyond that lies the big, sprawling farmhouse with the water behind it. The fields and orchards beyond are full of all manner of fruit and vegetables; cherries, oranges, blood oranges, various apples, peaches and pears, pumpkins, salad and garden produce, and fields of wheat, barley, malt, hops and rye.%0a32,40c32,40%0a%3c ||%25center%25%25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/ljYHfPK.png || %25center%25%25changeling%25[[Ascian Beng]] || %25changeling%25'''Yazata (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½)''' || %25changeling%25'''Asuraï¿½s Fire''' || %25changeling%25 '''Changeling''' ||%0a%3c ||%25center%25%25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/VqPPJ5S.jpg || %25center%25%25changeling%25[[Irene M Cervantes]] || %25changeling%25'''Yazata (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½)''' || %25changeling%25'''Ashaï¿½s Command''' || %25changeling%25 '''Changeling''' ||%0a%3c ||%25center%25%25thumb%25https://i.pinimg.com/564x/46/07/a1/4607a1123a1a1de2a5e6c5cd6576b8e2.jpg || %25center%25%25changeling%25[[Andrew Fox]] || %25changeling%25'''The Unstoppable Force (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½)''' || %25changeling%25'''Asuraï¿½s Fire''' || %25changeling%25 '''Changeling''' ||%0a%3c ||%25center%25%25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/jWeY4zw.jpg || %25center%25%25werewolf%25Josephine Garcia || %25werewolf%25'''The One Who Strives (ï¿½ï¿½)''' || %25werewolf%25'''Asuraï¿½s Fire''' || %25werewolf%25 '''Werewolf''' ||%0a%3c ||%25center%25%25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/NRYgV7y.gif|| %25center%25%25vampire%25[[Victor Beck]] || %25vampire%25'''The One Who Stands(ï¿½)''' || %25vampire%25'''Asuraï¿½s Fire''' || %25vampire%25 '''Vampire''' ||%0a%3c ||%25center%25%25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/3O1Iyg7.jpg || %25center%25%25beast%25[[David Harlow]] || %25beast%25'''The One Unbowed  (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½)''' || %25beast%25'''Ashaï¿½s Command''' || %25beast%25 '''Beast''' ||%0a%3c ||%25center%25%25thumb%25https://imgur.com/7I7BPla.jpg || %25center%25%25beast%25[[Elizabeth D'amico]] || %25beast%25'''The One Who Speaks (ï¿½)''' || %25beast%25'''Ashaï¿½s Command''' || %25beast%25 '''Beast''' ||%0a%3c ||%25center%25%25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25'''Rank (??)''' || %25mortal%25'''Asuraï¿½s Fire or Ashaï¿½s Command''' || %25mortal%25 '''Mortal''' ||%0a%3c %0a---%0a> ||%25center%25%25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/ljYHfPK.png || %25center%25%25changeling%25[[Ascian Beng]] || %25changeling%25'''Yazata (•••••)''' || %25changeling%25'''Asura’s Fire''' || %25changeling%25 '''Changeling''' ||%0a> ||%25center%25%25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/VqPPJ5S.jpg || %25center%25%25changeling%25[[Irene M Cervantes]] || %25changeling%25'''Yazata (•••••)''' || %25changeling%25'''Asha’s Command''' || %25changeling%25 '''Changeling''' ||%0a> ||%25center%25%25thumb%25https://i.pinimg.com/564x/46/07/a1/4607a1123a1a1de2a5e6c5cd6576b8e2.jpg || %25center%25%25changeling%25[[Andrew Fox]] || %25changeling%25'''The Unstoppable Force (••••)''' || %25changeling%25'''Asha’s Command''' || %25changeling%25 '''Changeling''' ||%0a> ||%25center%25%25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/jWeY4zw.jpg || %25center%25%25werewolf%25Josephine Garcia || %25werewolf%25'''The One Who Strives (••)''' || %25werewolf%25'''Asura’s Fire''' || %25werewolf%25 '''Werewolf''' ||%0a> ||%25center%25%25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/NRYgV7y.gif|| %25center%25%25vampire%25[[Victor Beck]] || %25vampire%25'''The One Who Stands(•)''' || %25vampire%25'''Asura’s Fire''' || %25vampire%25 '''Vampire''' ||%0a> ||%25center%25%25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/3O1Iyg7.jpg || %25center%25%25beast%25[[David Harlow]] || %25beast%25'''The One Unbowed  (•••)''' || %25beast%25'''Asha’s Command''' || %25beast%25 '''Beast''' ||%0a> ||%25center%25%25thumb%25https://imgur.com/7I7BPla.jpg || %25center%25%25beast%25[[Elizabeth D'amico]] || %25beast%25'''The One Who Speaks (•)''' || %25beast%25'''Asha’s Command''' || %25beast%25 '''Beast''' ||%0a> ||%25center%25%25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25'''Rank (??)''' || %25mortal%25'''Asura’s Fire or Asha’s Command''' || %25mortal%25 '''Mortal''' ||%0a> %0a42,64c42,64%0a%3c :%25center%25Shepherds: Asuraï¿½s Fire:%0a%3c %0a%3c ï¿½ The One Who Stands ï¿½ Your physical strength and capacity are without question, but you have tamed your power and made of yourself a safe harbor for those who need it..Others trust your strength and grace on sight. %0a%3c %0a%3c ï¿½ï¿½ The One Who Strives ï¿½ Your tenacity and determination make you a formidable foe, and you have learned to seek the higher reaches of your skills, and apply those skills to many paths.%0a%3c %0a%3c ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The One Unbowed ï¿½ You have learned to hold true to yourself against even the most horrific of foes, and your speed and skill give you the edge in any environment. %0a%3c %0a%3c ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The Unstoppable Force ï¿½ When others are at the limits of your strength you are only getting started.

A well-kept parking lot off the highway leads to the farm’s produce and product store and the visiting centre, with employee housing in a bunkhouse and single or two-bedroom prefabricated housing. A comfortable, well-appointed medical clinic staffed around the clock is maintained nearby as well. Beyond that lies the big, sprawling farmhouse with the water behind it. The fields and orchards beyond are full of all manner of fruit and vegetables; cherries, oranges, blood oranges, various apples, peaches and pears, pumpkins, salad and garden produce, and fields of wheat, barley, malt, hops and rye.%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c (:div2end:)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25mortal%25'''members'''%0a%3c %0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/3O1Iyg7.jpg || %25beast%25[[David Harlow]] || %25beast%25Vicious Lawyer and Politician || %25beast%25Namtaru Nemesis || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25beast%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c || %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/QRRTW65.png || %25mortal%25PC Name || %25mortal%25Relationship to PC || %25mortal%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25mortal%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%3c %0a%3c (:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c [[%3c%3c]]%0a%3c %0a
