He has a quick  smile and is easy to strike up a conversation with. His energy doesn't drift far from positive, accented by wafts of primal mutability and inquisitive passion. It's not hard for him to blend into most situations with relaxed, alluring ease. When it comes to his day-to-day wear, he dresses for the weather and the job, but usually it's a good pair of jeans, quality leather shoes or boots, and a smart jacket over a dress shirt or a soft, cozy sweater. %0a%0a%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.pinimg.com/originals/43/a3/8d/43a38de186b8e3b42a606918faacc5e8.png%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25%25color=#8b51b6%25''Long term''%0a%0a%25center%25 Spirits tend to be more active around Blake, and people that spend enough time in their presence may begin to hear the whispers of the spirit world, and feel a strange "realness" to the world around them, as if it is alive.%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25%25color=#8b51b6%25''Immediate''%0a%0a%25center%25 A rush of blood, and a primal passion flare momentarily in those that see Blake's nimbus, a call to let go in ecstatic release.%0aNimbus Tilt: -2 to Composure.%0a%0a!!!!%25center%25%25color=#8b51b6%25''Signature''%0a%0a%25center%25 Exhaustion and the ache of bones that come from partying too hard.%0a%0a%0a%0a\\%0a%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/2xrY225.png%0a%0a||! %25color=#8b51b6%25Image ||! %25color=#8b51b6%25Name ||! %25color=#8b51b6%25Relationship ||! %25color=#8b51b6%25Comment ||! %25color=#8b51b6%25Ringtone ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.pinimg.com/originals/69/c8/9f/69c89f337d0992e55012f4613f1f6296.png || %25mage%25[[Sasha Scorpio Domiano|Scorpio]] || %25mage%25Cabalmate, Friend, More || %25mage%25I think we've seen a lot of the same thing.

He has a quick  smile and is easy to strike up a conversation with. His energy doesn't drift far from positive, accented by wafts of primal mutability and inquisitive passion. It's not hard for him to blend into most situations with relaxed, alluring ease. When it comes to his day-to-day wear, he dresses for the weather and the job, but usually it's a good pair of jeans, quality leather shoes or boots, and a smart jacket over a dress shirt or a soft, cozy sweater. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25https://i.pinimg.com/originals/68/0f/d1/680fd122b36a62a67076c099105e89dc.png%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25center%25%25color=#8b51b6%25''Long term''%0a%3c %0a---%0a> ----%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25%25mage%25''Description'''%0a> %0a> %25center%25 See Picture%0a> %0a> ----%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25%25mage%25'''Nimbus'''%0a> %0a> !!!!!%25center%25%25mage%25''Long term'': %0a> %0a59,65c59,64%0a%3c !!!!%25center%25%25color=#8b51b6%25''Immediate''%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25 A rush of blood, and a primal passion flare momentarily in those that see Blake's nimbus, a call to let go in ecstatic release.%0a%3c Nimbus Tilt: -2 to Composure.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25center%25%25color=#8b51b6%25''Signature''%0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!!!!%25center%25%25mage%25''Immediate'': %0a> %0a> %25center%25 A rush of blood, and a primal passion flare momentarily in those that see Blake's nimbus, a call to let go in ecstatic release.
