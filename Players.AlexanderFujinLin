But it is most necessary that we remember what the world needs are dreamers who do.” - Truth, Leknaat%0a%0a%25mortal%25“Fujin is great, just to hang out with at a bar, to talk to, even to debate with. We don’t have the same outlook, but that’s what’s great about friends, yeah? You don’t *have* to have the same outlooks, just gotta be willing to accept the other person’s views as right for them” - Olivia%0a%0a%25mage%25“Warlocks tend to disappoint me, but Windy was a pleasant surprise. A rising star held back by attachments, which makes him ambitious and likable all at once” - Donna%0a%0a%25mage%25“A lot of things aren’t needed, but it doesn’t mean it’s always a bad idea if it’s not needed.” -Regis%0a%0a%25mage%25“He’s obviously nothing but trouble….but he has a way of making you feel really alive.

Nevermore may not like him too much but I think I’ll keep him around for now.” - Penny%0a%0a%25vampire%25“The first night we met I scolded him. The second night we chatted in the park…next thing I know I’m sitting in the Embassy starting to tell him my life story. Sort of. Fujin is intriguing and fun and if he can get Lorelei out of her shell and keep her out of it I’m all for having him stick around.” - [[Esme Wallson|Esme]]%0a%0a%25vampire%25“I like this dude. He makes me laugh, he knows how to have a good time, and he isn’t a dumbass. Him and Lore seem like a good match or whatever they are. I probably should say some stereotypical protective daddy shit, but I think he’s smart enough to know what happens to anyone that hurts my kid.” - [[Harvey Wallson]]%0a%0a%25mortal%25"Thank you" - Chesa%0a%0a%25mage%25"Dude is awesome to hang with.
