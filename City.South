He purchased property west of Red Road and Sunset Drive, where he built a home and barn. He also built the first general store east of that area in 1898 at what is known today as '"Cartagena Plaza" or "Cocoplum Circle" (actually in Coral Gables, Florida), and as the community grew, he established a post office in the community. Larkins became the first Postmaster, a role he held for sixteen years; he named the area Manila, but the majority of the settlers, who began building homes around his store, preferred the name "Larkins" in his honor.%0a%0aA depot was placed along the Florida East Coast Railway in 1904, and in the same year, John Moses Dowling built the first house within what is now South Miami city limits. His son-in-law opened the first store on the west side of the tracks, called the White Palace Grocery.%0a%0aOther prominent historic families have historic buildings and streets named for them, such as Dorn Avenue (Southwest 59th Avenue) and the Shelley Building, among others Harold W. Dorn and his brother Robert moved to the area in 1910; their primary interest was growing mango and avocado. Mary E. Dorn was the first president of the Cocoplum Thimble Club, the first Women's club in Larkins. In 1925, the Dorn brothers built the Riviera Theatre at 5700 South Dixie Highway; in 1934, Charles T. Fuchs moved his Holsum Bakery from Homestead to South Miami on the land where the Riviera Theatre had been.%0a%0aThe first African-American to purchase land in the Larkins area was Marshall Williamson, who moved there from Madison, Florida. He built his home at 6500 SW 60th Avenue and allowed it to be used for church services even before the construction was completed. In 1916, he donated land for the St. John's AME (African Methodist Episcopal) Church, one of Larkins's first churches and the first church in the black community; it is located at 6461 SW 59th Place. Later, Williamson also donated land for the J. R. E. Lee School. Because of his generosity, the black neighborhood became known as Madison Square, after Williamson's hometown. Williamson died in 1972. Named after him is Marshall Williamson Park, at 6125 SW 68 Street.%0a%0a[[#to]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Coconut Grove''%25%25%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/KjxeFZd.jpg%0aMiami’s original neighborhood was founded in 1873 by an eclectic mix of pioneers, artists, intellectuals and adventurers. The tropical oasis of Coconut Grove is an escape from the stresses of city life. Coconut Grove is located in the middle of Miami, yet completely separate and quaint.  The Grove offers a warm, laid-back atmosphere with charming boutiques, galleries, gourmet restaurants, sidewalk cafes and sailboats anchored at the bay. The neighborhood’s distinct bohemian flair and lush tropical canopy make this one of Miami’s favorite neighborhoods for locals and visitors alike. %0aFormerly an independent city, Coconut Grove was annexed by the city of Miami in 1925. In the 1960s, bay-shore Coconut Grove served as the center of South Florida's youth countercultural movement, notably hosting several love-ins and concerts (including a now-infamous Doors concert at Dinner Key Auditorium) during the latter part of the decade. The bohemian community continued to grow in Coconut Grove through the 1970s.%0a%0aA surge of commercial development in Coconut Grove was driven by the construction of three major residential complexes during the late 1970s and early 1980s: Yacht Harbour Condominiums in 1975; Grove Isle, a condominium, club and hotel complex, in 1979; and L'Hermitage in 1980. This was followed with the opening of 2575 S. Bayshore Drive in 1982 and 1983 opening of Grove Towers.

It is infamous for its strict zoning regulations. The city was developed by George Merrick during the Florida land boom of the 1920s. The city's architecture is almost entirely Mediterranean Revival style, mandated in the original plan, including the Coral Gables Congregational Church, donated by Merrick. The domed Catholic Church of the Little Flower was built somewhat later, in a similar Spanish Renaissance style. By 1926, the city covered 10,000 acres (4,000 ha) and had netted $150 million in sales, with over $100 million spent on development.%0a%0aMerrick meticulously designed the downtown commercial district to be only four blocks wide and more than two miles (3 km) long. The main artery bisected the business district. Merrick could boast that every business in Coral Gables was less than a two-block walk. The city used to have an electric trolley system, which was replaced by the popularity of modern automobiles, but now a new free circulator trolley system, initiated in November 2003, runs down Ponce de León Boulevard.%0a%0aIn 1925, roughly simultaneous to the founding of Coral Gables, the city was selected as the home to the University of Miami, which was constructed that year on 240 acres (97 ha) of land just west of U.S. Route 1, approximately two miles south of downtown Coral Gables.%0a%0aDuring World War II many Navy pilots and mechanics were trained and housed in Coral Gables. Today, Coral Gables is known as the Fine Dining Capital of South Florida.%0a%0aCoral Gables is a pedestrian-friendly destination. Located four miles from Miami International Airport, the "City Beautiful" has around 140 dining establishments and gourmet shops, and many notable international retailers.

It is the main east-west road through the city's downtown central business district, consisting of many shops, financial institutions, restaurants and arts institution. The LeJeune Road end of Miracle Mile is anchored by the Coral Gables City Hall.%0aMiracle Mile and the surrounding Downtown Coral Gables area is served indirectly by the Miami Metrorail by transferring from the Douglas Road station to the Coral Gables Trolley at the station. The trolley runs up and down Ponce de Leon Boulevard from Miracle Mile to the Metro.%0aThe boulevard is lined with restaurants, shops, boutiques, art galleries, and today "Downtown Coral Gables, including Miracle Mile, is one of South Florida's most sought-after shopping destinations."%0aThe downtown commercial district, including Miracle Mile, was designed by George Merrick, who could boast that every business in Coral Gables was less than a two-block walk.  The Colonnade Building at 133-169 Miracle Mile was designed in 1926 by Phineas Paist in collaboration with Walter De Garmo and Paul Chalfin in a mixture of Spanish Colonial and Baroque. The main purpose, in Merrick's planning, was to house his growing sales operation. Since the 1920s, the Colonnade has had many tenants including the Colonnade Movie Studios and a World War II parachute factory. Today it houses and hotel and office building designed by Spillis & Candela.%0aThe downtown commercial district was once serviced by a free trolley that ran down Ponce de Leon Boulevard, the main artery bisecting the business district. The old trolley system was replaced by the popularity of modern automobiles until a new free "trolley system" (buses with a "retro" trolly-like livery) was initiated in November 2003.%0a%0aAfter declines during the Great Depression and World War II, developers and business took to rebranding the area to turn it into a "high-end shopping destination." Through this vision and investment effort, the area was named Miracle Mile in 1955.%0aGeorge K. Zain and his wife Rebyl Zain contributed their leadership, enthusiasm and faith to the conception of the high-end shopping boulevard. Zain created a plan to resolve the solution to parking and built parking garages in the area. In 1960, George Zain was nicknamed "Father of Miracle Mile."%0aIn the Spring of 2016, Miracle Mile and Giralda Avenue began undergoing a street-scape design update. New York-based architecture firm Cooper Robertson has undertaken this $21 million re-design project. The new concept includes wider sidewalks, curb-less street edge lined with low stones and greenery, and a change in the parking structure.%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' •••••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Silver Bluff''%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/raa6sbb.jpg%0aSilver Bluff Estates is a smaller sub-neighborhood within the larger Coral Way neighborhood.

Much of this territory was the "City of Silver Bluff", which was annexed into the City of Miami in 1926. It is located at 25.749°N 80.236°W, with an elevation 10 feet (3.0 m).  Silver Bluff is one of the best and most affordable residential neighborhoods in the city. Often grouped in with the Gables, Brickell Hammocks or The Roads, there are few “secrets” in the Miami real estate market, and this is most certainly one of them.  Silver Bluff is close to everything in Miami. Only 5-7 minutes to Coconut Grove, 10-15 minutes to Brickell and Coral Gables and 15-20 minutes to South Beach.  The area has a low crime rating.  Silver Bluff is known as being a calm, residential area with lots of trees, ample parking and families. Relationships with neighbors are important here, and there is a real sense of community.  %0aFor wine lovers, Xixón Cafe , hip & modern Spanish eatery with multiple levels including dining room, wine cellar & bakery/deli, located on 21st and Coral Way, El Carajo is a must.

The original town boundaries were Red Road on the east, Kendall Drive to the south, Palmetto Road to the west (now Palmetto Expressway), and Bird Road and Miller Drive to the north. The year 1926 also saw the first street lighting and the first incoming class of freshmen at the newly chartered University of Miami campus, which abuts the city of South Miami eastern boundary along Red Road (SW 57th Avenue). Also founded with a university theme that same year was the Cambridge Lawns neighborhood of South Miami, situated just 0.7 miles (1.1 km) from the university campus. The neighborhood's Cambridge Lawns Historic District, some 30 homes in the Tudor Revival and Mediterranean revival style completed in 1928, were granted historic recognition by the City of South Miami in 2005.%0aAlso in 1926, South Miami received extensive damage from the 1926 Miami hurricane. The Town's leaders asked Congress to "relieve the people of their income tax for the current year," but federal assistance was not forthcoming. The Florida East Coast Railway station burned down, leaving the town without a station for many years. Residents suffered storm damage from Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and from Hurricane Bonnie (1998).%0aOn June 25, 1927, W. A. Forster was sworn in as South Miami's first Mayor.%0aIn 1933, the original six square miles of South Miami were reduced to just over three miles (5 km) due to an effort to reduce municipal responsibilities. The city's size was reduced again in 1937, and many of the northern city residents sued to get out of the city. This is why the city of South Miami has the most irregular boundaries of any city in Miami-Dade County today.%0aConstruction of the current City Hall building was approved by referendum in 1955. Designed by architect Henry George Fink, the governmental seat on Sunset Drive was dedicated in October 1956 by Mayor Paul U. Tevis.%0aJack Block was elected Mayor of the city in 1968, and was thereafter re-elected every two years until 1984 when, as he told interviewer Gregory W. Bush, "I started to not enjoy it as much."  In that interview, for the University of Miami Oral History Program, he gave snapshots of South Miami history when he told Bush (a history professor at the University of Miami),%0aIn 1990, Catherine (Rutherford) McCann (1933–2009) was elected as South Miami's first female Mayor, and was re-elected in 1992. She was responsible for the clean-up of South Miami after Hurricane Andrew; the Miami Herald wrote, "She had an encyclopedic knowledge of the South Miami city charter. She pushed for affordable housing and responsible development."%0aIn 2000, South Miami joined other municipalities in the country in forming city partnerships to help foster cultural and economic development between cities around the world. South Miami is a member of Sister Cities International and formed relationships with the cities of Grand Turk in Turks and Caicos Islands and Basseterre in Saint Kitts and Nevis.%0a%0a!!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a*%0a*%0a!!!!'''Average Resources''' •••%0a%0a!!!!'''Locations'''%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a*Link%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a(:include GameRef.Directoryhelp:)

In May 2008, Grapeland Water Park opened alongside the Melreese Country Club. The Grapeland Water Park is the first water park to open in Miami. The park is the largest city park in Grapeland Heights, and has proved very popular amongst young Miamians. In June 2011, it received national recognition from the City Parks Alliance chosen for its excellence in design and innovation.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!%25center%25''Miami Shores''%0a> %0a> By the early 1900s, the area encompassing today's Miami Shores Village was occupied by a starch (coontie) mill, a tomato packing plant, a saw mill, a pineapple plantation and a grapefruit grove. These were the various enterprises in which the early pioneers were engaged and with the coming of the railroad and its stop at the Biscayne Station, they were able to live off the land. Two of the most successful growers were Major Hugh Gordon and T.V. Moore. T.V. Moore owned the land in what is today's commercial district, while the Gordon Tract bordered the bay. By 1922, Lee T. Cooper, who had amassed his wealth from a patent medicine by the name of Tanlac, purchased T.V. Moore's land holdings. Cooper planned to develop the area and named it Bay View Estates. In 1924, the Shoreland Company purchased the Gordon Tract, Bay View Estates and other scattered acreage in order to create Miami Shores, "America's Mediterranean."%0a> %0a> Hugh M. Anderson, president of the Shoreland Company, and its board of directors were experienced real estate developers. They previously completed the successful development of the Venetian Islands and they decided that their new project would be similar – residences of Italian inspired architecture within a landscape associated with water. The master development plan for Greater Miami Shores included 9,000 building sites, 5 2/3 miles of bay frontage, four miles of inland waterways and ten miles of main roadways. The plans also called for the construction of a causeway to Miami Beach, a golf course, a country club, a yacht club, a business district, apartment buildings, hotels, a school and churches, a railroad station and beautifying features such as parks, plazas and entryways.%0a> %0a> Early in 1926, it was reported that approximately 50 homes had been completed, another 50 were under construction, and an additional 100 were being planned. The commercial building program was in progress, sidewalks and roadways were being laid out and lighting and landscape work was well underway. Record setting sales and resales of property were being recorded. Unfortunately, on September 18, 1926, all plans for the community came to a halt with the arrival of a devastating hurricane. In addition, other factors contributed to the Shoreland Company's bankruptcy in 1927.%0a> %0a> The present Miami Shores roughly corresponds with the original "Biscayne" neighborhood of the City of Miami. With the arrival of the Great Depression, the City of Miami gave up its jurisdiction and the area incorporated under the name Miami Shores Village in 1932. Previously, part of the area that now comprises the City of North Miami had been known as Miami Shores. Under the leadership of Roy H. Hawkins, a request to grant a charter creating Miami Shores Village was presented in the State Legislature. On January 2, 1932, the Village became official at a council meeting. The charter named the following five members to the first council: Hugh H. Gordon, a banker whose father had owned the Gordon Tract; Frank O. Pruitt, who was in the insurance business; John M. Carlisle, president of the Eli Witt Cigar Company; W.F. Andes, a prominent dentist; and M.R. Harrison, a general contractor, who constructed much of Biscayne Boulevard. At this first meeting, Pruitt was elected mayor, and other appointments were made including Village Manager Miller Williams, Village Attorney George E. Holt, and a single policeman, Ed Badger.%0a> %0a> In the decades that followed its incorporation, growth was steady. A variety of architectural styles were introduced, yet the community emerged as the type of development the Shoreland Company envisioned. The community retains many of its original characteristics – well situated and serviced by major highways, having tree-lined streets and wide roads, a downtown area, well-maintained homes provided with efficient services. and a variety of community activities.%0a> %0a> Today, Miami Shores is primarily a bedroom community for those working in Greater Miami, and has a sizeable retired population. The village is mostly single family residential homes, with very few multi-family units and only two small commercial areas along Northeast 2nd Avenue and Biscayne Boulevard.%0a> %0a> While it is frequently referred to as Miami Shores or the Village of Miami Shores, the municipality's official name under its charter is Miami Shores Village.%0a> %0a32,33c43,44%0a%3c !!!!'''Average Resources''' ••%0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' •••%0a> %0a35,39c46,50%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> *Barry’s University%0a> *Brockway Memorial Library%0a> *Miami Shores Country Club%0a> %0a> %0a42,45c53,59%0a%3c !!%25center%25''West Flagler''%25%25%0a%3c %0a%3c West Flagler is a neighborhood in Miami, Florida with a population of 52,799.

In 1970, Ben Novack, the Fontainebleau's original owner, grew jealous of Doris and Alfred Kaskel's plans in Doral and wanted to create his own planned golf course, resort, and community. It was to be known as Fontainebleau Park. Novack, however, soon fell into financial problems (and the Fontainebleau Park would play a part in the hotel's foreclosure in 1977).

Once a part of the pioneer settlement of Lemon City, Bayside contains the oldest intact community in Northeast Miami, as well as one of this area's last remaining bayfront estates. From its onset, Bayside was the home of many prominent residents who played significant roles in the business life of both Lemon City and Miami.%0a> %0a> Bayside has four distinct subdivisions which were plated between 1909 and 1925, although the area itself was first settled in the late nineteenth century. These subdivisions include Elmira (N.E. 68th Street and N.E. 67th Street), which was platted in 1909; Acadia (N.E. 70th Street), which was platted in 1915; Baywood (N.E. 69th Street and the south side of N.E. 71st Street), which was platted in 1921 and added to in 1924; and Washington Place (N.E. 72nd Street and the north side of N.E. 71st Street), which was platted in 1925.%0a> %0a> In 1909, William B. and Fred C. Miller (not related) subdivided a seven-acre bayfront lot on today's N.E. 68th Street. The Millers had come to Florida in the late 1880s from Elmira, New York and had developed Elmira Farms near Arch Creek. Their new subdivision was named Elmira, and oolitic limestone gates announced the entrance to the new community.%0a> %0a> While much of what was Lemon City has been engulfed by later developments, Elmira has remained virtually intact. Although many of its houses have deteriorated, and newer buildings have been added, the street retains much of its early character. Elmira is characterized by its excellent collection of Frame Vernacular buildings, many of which were inspired by Northern architectural styles. The Elmira Club at 742 N.E. 68th Street, for example, has Dutch Colonial Revival influences, while other houses display classical details. The majority of houses were constructed in the 1910s.%0a> %0a> The Acadia subdivision was platted in 1915 by the Realty Securities Corporation and George E. Merrick. Although the subdivision evokes the memory of Longfellow with such names as Acadian Way, Evangeline Circle, Tropical Trail, and Druid Walk, the houses developed here are distinctly Mediterranean Revival in influence. This is due perhaps to the fact that only two houses were constructed prior to 1925. Development took off during the Boom years of the mid-1920s, however, when Wykoff and Estes Builders constructed an outstanding cluster of large, two-story Mediterranean Revival style houses near the eastern end of NE 70th Street.%0a> %0a> The last subdivision to be subdivided was Washington Place, which was also developed between 1925 and the mid-1940s. Samuel J. Prescott, who platted the subdivision in 1925, had constructed his own winter home at 7101 N.E. 10th Avenue some years before. The house remains today as one of the last intact bayfront estates in Northeast Miami. The estate once featured a recreational golf course for residents and guests. Prescott was the founder of the firm of Samuel J. Prescott Co., Inc., building contractors, which developed several significant buildings in downtown Washington, D.C. Prescott was chairman of the board of the Second National Bank of Washington, D.C., president of the Master Builders Association, the Builders and Manufacturers Exchange, and the Prescott Farms Company of New Hampshire.%0a> %0a> The Bayside Historic District remains today as an intact, cohesive neighborhood. Despite the number of post-1941 buildings, Bayside retains a high level of historic and architectural integrity.Houses constructed in Bayside reflect the diversity, direction, and taste of individual residents as well as the architectural eclecticism prevalent in the early-20th century. The earlier buildings in the district are Frame Vernacular, with several examples of early bungalows. Houses built in the 1920s are generally Mediterranean Revival in style, while structures built in the 1930s and 1940s are frequently Art Deco. Bayside also features a number of excellent examples of other architectural styles, including Mission Revival, Streamline Moderne, and Florida Ranch.

Several people settled near Biscayne Bay north of the Miami River after the civil war, squatting on unclaimed land. Some of the squatters eventually applied for homestead grants for the land they were squatting on. By 1889 a community had formed, with a post office named "Motto". "Lemon City" replaced "Motto" as the name of the community by 1893. A school had opened in 1890, and Lemon City also included several businesses and a newspaper, as well as port facilities on Biscayne Bay. With the extension of the Florida East Coast Railway to Miami in 1896, Miami quickly overshadowed Lemon City.%0a> %0a> %0a> Portrait of Father Gérard Jean-Juste on a gable wall by Serge Toussaint in Little Haiti.%0a> Viter Juste, a noted Haitian businessman, activist and respected community leader, came up with the name of Little Haiti. According to Jean-Claude Exulien, a retired professor of history and friend of Juste's since 1977, Juste wrote an article in the Miami Herald in which he first referred to the neighborhood as "Little Port-au-Prince." However, editors at the Miami Herald found the name, "Little Port-au-Prince," too long, so the newspaper shortened the term in the headline to Little Haiti. Over the objections of historians and African-Americans, Miami commissioners in May 2016 voted in favor of designating Little Haiti as an official neighborhood with boundaries overlapping the historic Lemon City, which was founded by Bahamian immigrants before Miami existed.%0a> %0a> %0a> !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a> *%0a> *%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' • to ••%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Locations'''%0a> *Little Haiti’s main strip%0a> *The Little Haiti Community Garden%0a> *Athalie Range Park%0a> *Caribbean Marketplace%0a> %0a> %0a> %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25''Liberty City''%25%25%0a> %0a> Once a part of the sparsely populated outskirts of northern Miami, what became Liberty City developed during the Great Depression of the 1930s when President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized the construction of the Liberty Square housing project in 1933, the first of its kind in the Southern United States. Built as a response to the deteriorating housing conditions in densely populated and covenant-restricted slums of Overtown, construction on the initial housing project began in 1934 and opened in 1937.%0a> %0a> Into the 1940s and 1950s, the growing Liberty City and adjacent Brownsville thrived as a middle income black American community, hosting several churches, hospitals, and community centers. The area served as home to prominent figures such as Kelsey Pharr, M. Athalie Range (the first black American elected to serve on the Miami city commission) and boxer Muhammad Ali. Although segregation laws prohibited black Americans from resting and residing in popular Miami Beach, service establishment and resorts such as the Hampton House Motel and Villas catered to and entertained the likes of notables such as Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Althea Gibson, and even whites such as Mickey Mantle.%0a> %0a> Construction of Interstate 95 in Florida in Overtown and declining use of restrictive covenants in the wake of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 dramatically altered the neighborhood into the 1960s. Increasing numbers of lower income elderly and welfare-dependent families migrated to the Liberty City neighborhood following their displacement primarily from inner city Overtown, leading to large-scale black flight of middle and higher income blacks and other blacks like West Indian Americans largely to suburban areas like Florida City and Miami Gardens in southern and northern Dade County, respectively.%0a> %0a> Crime grew prevalent in the increasingly poverty-stricken area in the immediate post–civil rights movement era of the 1960s and 1970s. The ensuing problems of the poor and disenfranchised grew most apparent and notable in race riots which occurred in Liberty City in August 1968 during the Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, and in 1980 following the acquittal of police officers charged with the killing of Arthur McDuffie.%0a> %0a> The plight of inner-city black Miamians increasingly came to be highlighted in national press into the 1980s as the Hurricanes football team of the University of Miami won several national college football championships led by players recruited from the mostly black, lower income neighborhoods such as Liberty City and Overtown. National exposure continued with the popularity of nationally broadcast programs such as the NBC crime drama Miami Vice, which brought the deteriorating conditions of the area to greater prominence.%0a> %0a> Into the 1990s and 2000s, the music grew to reflect the area with locals such as Luther Campbell of 2 Live Crew pioneering the Miami bass genre which dominated Southern hip hop music during the decade.

During the Land Boom of the 1920s, the area was developed as the Biltmore and Shadowlawn subdivisions. Originally home to many Florida cracker immigrants from Georgia and North Carolina, the neighborhood soon became popular with the owners of nearby businesses. The houses reflect their original owners' rising social status and include fine examples of Mediterranean Revival, Mission, Craftsman, and Art Deco architecture style residences.%0a> %0a> Buena Vista, Lemon City, and Little River were founded before the turn of the 19th-century and represent some of the earliest settlements in Miami-Dade County. The area known as Buena Vista was once a small village adjoining, but not within the corporate limits of Miami proper. Although preceded in age by pioneer Lemon City, a town located a little further north, the small village of Buena Vista dates its birth, development, and growth along with Miami’s. The founding of Buena Vista dates back to the days when the immense rock ridge extending between the Atlantic Ocean and the Florida Everglades was covered by a dense pine forest. The earliest history of the village is recorded in a survey made by government surveyors, and the locations of the land tracts are to this date still founded on this early document.%0a> The land which became Buena Vista was originally part of the homesteads of William Henry Gleason and E.L. White. Gleason, a prominent and somewhat notorious figure in early Miami-Dade County politics, arrived in Miami after the Civil War was elected Lieutenant Governor of Florida. He left the area in 1876 but retained his homestead for several years, eventually turning it over to his son. As early as 1892, E.L. White homesteaded the area from North 41st Street to 54th Street between West 2nd Avenue and East 2nd Avenue. This was the area from which the Biltmore and Shadowlawn Subdivisions, which today make up the "Buena Vista East Historic District", were carved in the early 1920s.%0a> %0a> The arrival of the railroad in 1896 marked the end of an era for the pioneer bayfront village of Lemon City, which had enjoyed tremendous importance to the Miami area by virtue of its docks. Now the train brought much needed supplies to the rest of Dade County, and lured people away from the bayfront community to Miami and its outlying areas. The Lemon City depot, built in 1896, drew business further west away from the bay, and the small village of Buena Vista gradually developed. One of the earliest subdivisions in the Buena Vista areas was the Buena Vista Biscayne Badger Club Subdivision, which was developed in 1910 as a bayfront community with a private water plant, streets, and a park with recreation dock on the bay. However, it was inland where the village took shape. By 1910, suburban Buena Vista could boast of one hotel known as the Courley House, its very own railroad depot on the Florida East Coast Railway line, a small post office building, tropical fruit groves, a fruit-packing house, a grocery store, and one religious institution, the Holy Cross Episcopal Church.%0a> %0a> Other prominent citizens acquired land in Buena Vista. Among them was the millionaire, Charles Deering, who purchased a large tract of bayfront land east of the railroad, in the area now known as the Upper Eastside. This land is where the "Baypoint" neighborhood is now located. Much of the area fronting the bay was naturally wooded, and here Deering created an arboretum and sanctuary for birds and animals. There were no public roadways in the area east of the railroad, and since Deering strongly opposed the opening of such streets, the area was preserved in its pristine, virgin state for many years.%0a> %0a> As the population of Miami grew between the late 1910s through the Boom era of the early 1920s, new areas reached northward along the old Dixie Highway (N.E. 2nd Avenue) and Avenue D (N. Miami Avenue), which was extended northward from N.E. 36th Street. The northern city limit of Miami was moved to N.E. 38th Street, and this took in a part of Buena Vista. Finally, on August 4, 1924, the new town of Buena Vista was incorporated and, together with the other incorporated areas of Coconut Grove and Silver Bluff, was annexed to the City of Miami the following year.%0a> %0a> %0a> !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a> *%0a> *%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' ••%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Locations'''%0a> *Buena Vista East Historic District%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> %0a> %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25''Morning Side''%0a> %0a> Started in the 1920s as "Bay Shore," it prospered in the mid-20th century and fell on hard times along with most of Miami's other inner city neighborhoods in the 60's and 70's. More recently Morningside was the first historic area in central Miami to experience gentrification with an influx of more-affluent residents. It has now been fully restored. The Morningside Historic District runs from NE 55th Street to NE 60th Street; it was the first historic district to be designated as such in the City of Miami. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992 as the Bay Shore Historic District.%0a> %0a> The Morningside Historic District is significant to the history of architecture, landscape architecture, and community development in Miami. Developed primarily between 1922 and 1941, Morningside contains a wealth of Mediterranean, Art Deco, and vernacular style houses that reflect the diversity and direction of architectural design during the 1920s and 1930s. Morningside is one of Miami's best planned subdivisions, featuring wide, tree-lined boulevards that contribute to the character of the area. This neighborhood was envisioned as an exclusive, residential community, and its amenities and location on Biscayne Bay attracted many influential and prominent local residents. One of Miami's most intact historic neighborhoods, Morningside is the City's best remaining example of a boom-era suburb.%0a> %0a> The Morningside Historic District stands today as one of Miami's most intact historic neighborhoods. Despite the number of post-1941 buildings in the area, Morningside retains a high degree of historic and architectural integrity. This is due, in part, to the fact that most later buildings are not intrusive, but respect the earlier structures in scale, setback, materials, and workmanship. The majority of neighborhood residents recognize the special character of the area and desire its continued preservation.%0a> %0a> As Miami's population expanded during the late 1920s and early 1920s, new subdivisions reached northward along Biscayne Bay. In 1922, a large, undeveloped bayfront tract near the northern city limits was platted. Called Bay Shore, this area was subdivided by the Bay Shore Investment Company and was the first of three phases that would be developed by the company between 1922 and 1924.Houses constructed in the Morningside Historic District reflect the eclecticism popular in the early twentieth century. The earlier buildings in the district are predominantly Mediterranean Revival in style, while structures built in the 1930s and early 1940s are frequently Art Deco. Outstanding examples of both styles are found here. Morningside also features a large number of masonry vernacular buildings that frequently utilize elements of several styles. An unusual Tudor Revival style house and one of the City's best examples of Mission style architecture add to the area's architectural diversity.%0a> %0a> %0a> !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a> *%0a> *%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' •••%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Locations'''%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> %0a> %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25''Bay Point''%25%25%0a> %0a> The Bayside Historic District reflects the formative years of the early 1900s through the mid-1940s. Once a part of the pioneer settlement of Lemon City, Bayside contains the oldest intact community in Northeast Miami, as well as one of this area's last remaining bayfront estates. From its onset, Bayside was the home of many prominent residents who played significant roles in the business life of both Lemon City and Miami.%0a> %0a> Bayside has four distinct subdivisions which were platted between 1909 and 1925, although the area itself was first settled in the late nineteenth century. These subdivisions include Elmira (N.E. 68th Street and N.E. 67th Street), which was platted in 1909; Acadia (N.E. 70th Street), which was platted in 1915; Baywood (N.E. 69th Street and the south side of N.E. 71st Street), which was platted in 1921 and added to in 1924; and Washington Place (N.E. 72nd Street and the north side of N.E. 71st Street), which was platted in 1925.%0a> %0a> In 1909, William B. and Fred C. Miller (not related) subdivided a seven-acre bayfront lot on today's N.E. 68th Street. The Millers had come to Florida in the late 1880s from Elmira, New York and had developed Elmira Farms near Arch Creek. Their new subdivision was named Elmira, and oolitic limestone gates announced the entrance to the new community.%0a> %0a> While much of what was Lemon City has been engulfed by later developments, Elmira has remained virtually intact. Although many of its houses have deteriorated, and newer buildings have been added, the street retains much of its early character. Elmira is characterized by its excellent collection of Frame Vernacular buildings, many of which were inspired by Northern architectural styles. The Elmira Club at 742 N.E. 68th Street, for example, has Dutch Colonial Revival influences, while other houses display classical details. The majority of houses were constructed in the 1910s.%0a> %0a> The Acadia subdivision was platted in 1915 by the Realty Securities Corporation and George E. Merrick. Although the subdivision evokes the memory of Longfellow with such names as Acadian Way, Evangeline Circle, Tropical Trail, and Druid Walk, the houses developed here are distinctly Mediterranean Revival in influence. This is due perhaps to the fact that only two houses were constructed prior to 1925. Development took off during the Boom years of the mid-1920s, however, when Wykoff and Estes Builders constructed an outstanding cluster of large, two-story Mediterranean Revival style houses near the eastern end of NE 70th Street.%0a> %0a> The last subdivision to be subdivided was Washington Place, which was also developed between 1925 and the mid-1940s. Samuel J. Prescott, who platted the subdivision in 1925, had constructed his own winter home at 7101 N.E. 10th Avenue some years before. The house remains today as one of the last intact bayfront estates in Northeast Miami. The estate once featured a recreational golf course for residents and guests. Prescott was founder of the firm of Samuel J. Prescott Co., Inc., building contractors, which developed several significant buildings in downtown Washington, D.C. Prescott was chairman of the board of the Second National Bank of Washington, D.C., president of the Master Builders Association, the Builders and Manufacturers Exchange, and the Prescott Farms Company of New Hampshire.%0a> %0a> The Bayside Historic District remains today as an intact, cohesive neighborhood. Despite the number of post-1941 buildings, Bayside retains a high level of historic and architectural integrity.%0a> Houses constructed in Bayside reflect the diversity, direction, and taste of individual residents as well as the architectural eclecticism prevalent in the early-20th century. The earlier buildings in the district are Frame Vernacular, with several examples of early bungalows. Houses built in the 1920s are generally Mediterranean Revival in style, while structures built in the 1930s and 1940s are frequently Art Deco. Bayside also features a number of excellent examples of other architectural styles, including Mission Revival, Streamline Moderne, and Florida Ranch. Other structures, best described as Masonry Vernacular, add to the area's architectural diversity.%0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a> *%0a> *%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' •••%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Locations'''%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> %0a> %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25''Midtown''%25%25%0a> %0a> Midtown Miami is the collective term for the Wynwood and Edgewater neighborhoods of Miami, Florida, United States, north of Downtown and south of the Miami Design District. It is roughly bound by North 20th Street to the south, I-195 to the north, I-95 to the west and Biscayne Bay to the east.%0a> %0a> In 2005, construction began on the "Midtown Miami" development between North 29th and 36th Street and Miami Avenue and the Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) on what was historically an FEC rail yard. The project is a large-scale, urban development that was planned with 8 high-rise residential buildings, a hotel, two parks, and a major urban shopping area, "The Shops at Midtown". Due to the collapse of the real estate bubble in 2007, only two residential buildings, and about 2/3 of "The Shops at Midtown" were built. In July 2011, plans were announced to begin construction on a new entertainment center at Midtown, including a hotel, and shops on the site of the current temporary park in the center of Midtown. Critics of Midtown state the lack of parks as a major issue.%0a> %0a> Midtown has grown quickly, and is home to Shops at Midtown, an outdoor shopping area designed to mimic New York's SOHO neighborhood, and home to many national and local stores and restaurants including Target, Guess, HomeGoods, Marshalls, Sakaya Kitchen, Baru Urbano, Novecento & IT Lounge, Riviera Focacceria Italiana, Giraffas Brazilian Grill, Spris, Bar Louie, Wine Vault, 100 Montaditos, World of Beer, Chef Leon, Mercado Latino, My Ceviche, Five Guys Burgers & Fries, 4D Gelateria, Hurricane Grill & Wings, Lime Fresh Mexican Grill, Spun Candy, Pinkberry, SugarCane, Mercadito, Lagniappe, Sustain, Cheese Course, Buro Miami, Ring Finger Studio, and an abundance of upscale apartments. A fair amount of office businesses have also taken up residence in Midtown in office buildings, in industries ranging from interior decor to marketing agency services, and more. At Büro Urbano urban workspace, office spaces are provided for small businesses. Midtown has also become home to Art Miami art fair, which takes place during Miami's Art Basel week.%0a> %0a> On 1 August 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a travel warning, advising pregnant women not to visit Midtown Miami, the Design District and Wynwood areas to avoid getting the Zika virus. Zika warnings in Miami have been lifted by the end of 2016%0a> %0a> Bacardi's United States headquarters were located in the Bacardi buildings also near Midtown Miami. By 2007 Bacardi USA agreed to lease a complex in Coral Gables to use as its new headquarters. At that time, Bacardi had employees in seven buildings across South Florida. Bacardi vacated its former headquarters buildings. Miami citizens began a campaign to label the buildings as historic. Allan T. Schulman, a professor of architecture at the University of Miami, said "Miami's brand is its identity as a tropical city. The Bacardi buildings are exactly the sort that resonate with our consciousness of what Miami is about."  In 2007 Chad Oppenheim, the head of Oppenheim Architecture + Design, described the Bacardi buildings as "elegant, with a Modernist [look combined with] a local flavor." In late 2012, the National YoungArts Foundation purchased the storied Bacardi buildings and converted them into their national headquarters%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a> *%0a> *%0a> !!!!'''Average Resources''' ••••%0a> %0a> !!!!'''Locations'''%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> *Link%0a> %0a> %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a> %0a> !!%25center%25''Design District''%25%25%0a> %0a> The Miami Design District is a neighborhood in Miami, Florida, United States and a shopping, dining and cultural destination.

It is home to over 130 art galleries, showrooms, creative services, architecture firms, luxury fashion stores, antiques dealers, eateries and bars. %0a> %0a> The Design District is in the crossroads of many prominent Miami neighborhoods, with the artsy Wynwood neighborhood to the south, Lemon City (Little Haiti) and the historic 1920s Buena Vista neighborhood to the north, and the wealthy Upper East Side neighborhoods to the east. After decades of falling into disrepair, the Design District has been restored as a destination for the arts, design, and fashion.%0a> %0a> High-end brands like Louis Vuitton, Dior, Prada, Saint Laurent and Hermes are located in the Design District as well as restaurants from award-winning chefs like Michael Schwartz and celebrities like Gloria and Emilio Estefan; a public art collection with works from Buckminster Fuller, Marc Newsom and Urs Fischer as well as museums and galleries like the Institute for Contemporary Art, Miami, The de la Cruz Collection of Contemporary Art and Locust Projects.%0a> %0a> The area of land that is now the Design District was once a pineapple farm in a neighborhood referred to as Buena Vista. Farm owner, T.V. Moore, built the historic Moore Building in the 1920s for his family furniture business. The Moore Furniture Building was one of the first stores in the U.S. dedicated strictly to furniture.%0a> %0a> By the 1980s and early-1990s, the Design District had fallen into disrepair, and it wasn't until the late 1990s, and early 2000s, that art and design stores began reopening.%0a> %0a> Credited to starting the district is Craig Robins, who purchased many run-down buildings in the 18 square block area and persuaded many top designers, such as Alison Spear, Peter Page, Kartell, and Luminaire, as well as furniture and textile designer Holly Hunt to open studios and showrooms in the area.%0a> %0a> Throughout the 2000s, the Design District continued to grow in popularity, and with heavy public and private investment in the neighborhood, the streets and sidewalks were redone, and new trees were planted.%0a> %0a> In 2010, Dacra, of which Craig Robins is the founder and CEO, and L Real Estate (now L Catterton) formed a partnership to develop the Design District into a luxury shopping and lifestyle destination featuring prominent architects from around the world and flagship locations of fashion brands like Dior, Hermes and Louis Vuitton.%0a> Today, signs and names with the name Buena Vista can still be seen throughout the area such as the Buena Vista Post Office, and Buena Vista School. %0a> %0a> On 1 August 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a travel warning, advising pregnant women not to visit the Design District, Wynwood, and Midtown Miami areas to avoid getting the Zika virus.

Wynwood is best known for being a prominent entertainment district, dotted with artwork, restaurants, breweries, clothing stores, dance venues, among other retail options. Formerly an industrial district, the area is highlighted by colorful murals that cover the walls of many of the buildings. It is north of Downtown Miami and Overtown, and adjacent to Edgewater. Wynwood has two major sub-districts, the Wynwood Art District in northern Wynwood, and the Wynwood Fashion District along West 5th Avenue. Wynwood is roughly divided by North 20th Street to the south, I-195 to the north, I-95 to the west and the Florida East Coast Railway to the east.%0a> %0a> Wynwood was long referred to as "Little San Juan", and commonly known as "El Barrio" as many Puerto Ricans began immigrating to this Miami neighborhood from the island and northeastern cities in the 1950s. Puerto Rican-owned restaurants, shops, markets and other businesses line the streets of Wynwood. Since the early 2000s, the neighborhood has seen a rising amount of investments and attention, expanding the scope of the region. The Midtown Miami development construction began in 2005 between North 29th and 36th Street and Miami Avenue and the Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) on what was historically an FEC rail yard. This brought renewed attention to the area, and previously abandoned warehouses have begun to be occupied by artists, restaurants, cafés, and lounges. Tony Goldman, a developer, also assisted in the growth of Wynwood by creating a mecca out of the already present graffiti. In 2009, artists commissioned by Goldman helped create the Wynwood Walls. Located in the Wynwood Art District, this is an outdoor exhibition of rotating street art.%0a> Art district%0a> The Wynwood Art District is a sub-district of Wynwood that contains galleries, outdoor murals and private art collections.

Development ensued from 1896 and into the 20th century in the area with the completion of the Florida East Coast Railroad (FEC).%0a> %0a> Allapattah was predominantly populated by whites from early in the 20th century until the late 1950s, when there was a large influx of black Americans displaced by the construction of I-95 (then, the North-South Expressway) in the 1950s and 1960s, leading to white flight to suburban Miami-Dade County and Broward County. Cubans migrated to Miami neighborhoods like Allapattah in large numbers following the Cuban Revolution of 1959, hosting one of Miami's largest Cuban American populations. The 1980s brought influxes of Dominican Americans, Nicaraguans, Hondurans, and Haitians in the aftermath of various refugee crises in those nations.

Two of the most successful growers were Major Hugh Gordon and T.V. Moore. T.V. Moore owned the land in what is today's commercial district, while the Gordon Tract bordered the bay. By 1922, Lee T. Cooper, who had amassed his wealth from a patent medicine by the name of Tanlac, purchased T.V. Moore's land holdings. Cooper planned to develop the area and named it Bay View Estates. In 1924, the Shoreland Company purchased the Gordon Tract, Bay View Estates and other scattered acreage in order to create Miami Shores, "America's Mediterranean."%0a%3c %0a%3c Hugh M. Anderson, president of the Shoreland Company, and its board of directors were experienced real estate developers. They previously completed the successful development of the Venetian Islands and they decided that their new project would be similar – residences of Italian inspired architecture within a landscape associated with water. The master development plan for Greater Miami Shores included 9,000 building sites, 5 2/3 miles of bay frontage, four miles of inland waterways and ten miles of main roadways. The plans also called for the construction of a causeway to Miami Beach, a golf course, a country club, a yacht club, a business district, apartment buildings, hotels, a school and churches, a railroad station and beautifying features such as parks, plazas and entryways.%0a%3c %0a%3c Early in 1926, it was reported that approximately 50 homes had been completed, another 50 were under construction, and an additional 100 were being planned. The commercial building program was in progress, sidewalks and roadways were being laid out and lighting and landscape work was well underway. Record setting sales and resales of property were being recorded. Unfortunately, on September 18, 1926, all plans for the community came to a halt with the arrival of a devastating hurricane. In addition, other factors contributed to the Shoreland Company's bankruptcy in 1927.%0a%3c %0a%3c The present Miami Shores roughly corresponds with the original "Biscayne" neighborhood of the City of Miami. With the arrival of the Great Depression, the City of Miami gave up its jurisdiction and the area incorporated under the name Miami Shores Village in 1932. Previously, part of the area that now comprises the City of North Miami had been known as Miami Shores. Under the leadership of Roy H. Hawkins, a request to grant a charter creating Miami Shores Village was presented in the State Legislature. On January 2, 1932, the Village became official at a council meeting. The charter named the following five members to the first council: Hugh H. Gordon, a banker whose father had owned the Gordon Tract; Frank O. Pruitt, who was in the insurance business; John M. Carlisle, president of the Eli Witt Cigar Company; W.F. Andes, a prominent dentist; and M.R. Harrison, a general contractor, who constructed much of Biscayne Boulevard. At this first meeting, Pruitt was elected mayor, and other appointments were made including Village Manager Miller Williams, Village Attorney George E. Holt, and a single policeman, Ed Badger.%0a%3c %0a%3c In the decades that followed its incorporation, growth was steady. A variety of architectural styles were introduced, yet the community emerged as the type of development the Shoreland Company envisioned. The community retains many of its original characteristics – well situated and serviced by major highways, having tree-lined streets and wide roads, a downtown area, well-maintained homes provided with efficient services. and a variety of community activities.%0a%3c %0a%3c Today, Miami Shores is primarily a bedroom community for those working in Greater Miami, and has a sizeable retired population. The village is mostly single family residential homes, with very few multi-family units and only two small commercial areas along Northeast 2nd Avenue and Biscayne Boulevard.%0a%3c %0a%3c While it is frequently referred to as Miami Shores or the Village of Miami Shores, the municipality's official name under its charter is Miami Shores Village.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Average Resources''' •••%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Locations'''%0a%3c *Barry’s University%0a%3c *Brockway Memorial Library%0a%3c *Miami Shores Country Club%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25''Little River''%25%25%0a%3c %0a%3c Little River is a neighborhood in Miami, Florida.

The neighborhood is bordered to the north by El Portal, to the south by Little Haiti (Lemon City), to the east by the Palm Grove Historic District, and to the west by West Little River.  It is home to many features.  Such as the Cathedral of St. Mary Originally formed in 1929 under the title "Little River Mission Club", the historic church is the only cathedral in Miami.

Once a part of the pioneer settlement of Lemon City, Bayside contains the oldest intact community in Northeast Miami, as well as one of this area's last remaining bayfront estates. From its onset, Bayside was the home of many prominent residents who played significant roles in the business life of both Lemon City and Miami.%0a%3c %0a%3c Bayside has four distinct subdivisions which were plated between 1909 and 1925, although the area itself was first settled in the late nineteenth century. These subdivisions include Elmira (N.E. 68th Street and N.E. 67th Street), which was platted in 1909; Acadia (N.E. 70th Street), which was platted in 1915; Baywood (N.E. 69th Street and the south side of N.E. 71st Street), which was platted in 1921 and added to in 1924; and Washington Place (N.E. 72nd Street and the north side of N.E. 71st Street), which was platted in 1925.%0a%3c %0a%3c In 1909, William B. and Fred C. Miller (not related) subdivided a seven-acre bayfront lot on today's N.E. 68th Street. The Millers had come to Florida in the late 1880s from Elmira, New York and had developed Elmira Farms near Arch Creek. Their new subdivision was named Elmira, and oolitic limestone gates announced the entrance to the new community.%0a%3c %0a%3c While much of what was Lemon City has been engulfed by later developments, Elmira has remained virtually intact. Although many of its houses have deteriorated, and newer buildings have been added, the street retains much of its early character. Elmira is characterized by its excellent collection of Frame Vernacular buildings, many of which were inspired by Northern architectural styles. The Elmira Club at 742 N.E. 68th Street, for example, has Dutch Colonial Revival influences, while other houses display classical details. The majority of houses were constructed in the 1910s.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Acadia subdivision was platted in 1915 by the Realty Securities Corporation and George E. Merrick. Although the subdivision evokes the memory of Longfellow with such names as Acadian Way, Evangeline Circle, Tropical Trail, and Druid Walk, the houses developed here are distinctly Mediterranean Revival in influence. This is due perhaps to the fact that only two houses were constructed prior to 1925. Development took off during the Boom years of the mid-1920s, however, when Wykoff and Estes Builders constructed an outstanding cluster of large, two-story Mediterranean Revival style houses near the eastern end of NE 70th Street.%0a%3c %0a%3c The last subdivision to be subdivided was Washington Place, which was also developed between 1925 and the mid-1940s. Samuel J. Prescott, who platted the subdivision in 1925, had constructed his own winter home at 7101 N.E. 10th Avenue some years before. The house remains today as one of the last intact bayfront estates in Northeast Miami. The estate once featured a recreational golf course for residents and guests. Prescott was the founder of the firm of Samuel J. Prescott Co., Inc., building contractors, which developed several significant buildings in downtown Washington, D.C. Prescott was chairman of the board of the Second National Bank of Washington, D.C., president of the Master Builders Association, the Builders and Manufacturers Exchange, and the Prescott Farms Company of New Hampshire.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Bayside Historic District remains today as an intact, cohesive neighborhood. Despite the number of post-1941 buildings, Bayside retains a high level of historic and architectural integrity.Houses constructed in Bayside reflect the diversity, direction, and taste of individual residents as well as the architectural eclecticism prevalent in the early-20th century. The earlier buildings in the district are Frame Vernacular, with several examples of early bungalows. Houses built in the 1920s are generally Mediterranean Revival in style, while structures built in the 1930s and 1940s are frequently Art Deco. Bayside also features a number of excellent examples of other architectural styles, including Mission Revival, Streamline Moderne, and Florida Ranch. Other structures, best described as Masonry Vernacular, add to the area's architectural diversity.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a%3c *%0a%3c *%0a%3c !!!!'''Average Resources''' •••%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Locations'''%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25''Lemon City(Little Haiti)''%25%25%0a%3c %0a%3c The area now known as Little Haiti was called Lemon City for well over a century. Several people settled near Biscayne Bay north of the Miami River after the civil war, squatting on unclaimed land. Some of the squatters eventually applied for homestead grants for the land they were squatting on. By 1889 a community had formed, with a post office named "Motto". "Lemon City" replaced "Motto" as the name of the community by 1893. A school had opened in 1890, and Lemon City also included several businesses and a newspaper, as well as port facilities on Biscayne Bay. With the extension of the Florida East Coast Railway to Miami in 1896, Miami quickly overshadowed Lemon City.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Portrait of Father Gérard Jean-Juste on a gable wall by Serge Toussaint in Little Haiti.%0a%3c Viter Juste, a noted Haitian businessman, activist and respected community leader, came up with the name of Little Haiti. According to Jean-Claude Exulien, a retired professor of history and friend of Juste's since 1977, Juste wrote an article in the Miami Herald in which he first referred to the neighborhood as "Little Port-au-Prince." However, editors at the Miami Herald found the name, "Little Port-au-Prince," too long, so the newspaper shortened the term in the headline to Little Haiti. Over the objections of historians and African-Americans, Miami commissioners in May 2016 voted in favor of designating Little Haiti as an official neighborhood with boundaries overlapping the historic Lemon City, which was founded by Bahamian immigrants before Miami existed.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a%3c *%0a%3c *%0a%3c !!!!'''Average Resources''' • to ••%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Locations'''%0a%3c *Little Haiti’s main strip%0a%3c *The Little Haiti Community Garden%0a%3c *Athalie Range Park%0a%3c *Caribbean Marketplace%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25''Liberty City''%25%25%0a%3c %0a%3c Once a part of the sparsely populated outskirts of northern Miami, what became Liberty City developed during the Great Depression of the 1930s when President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized the construction of the Liberty Square housing project in 1933, the first of its kind in the Southern United States. Built as a response to the deteriorating housing conditions in densely populated and covenant-restricted slums of Overtown, construction on the initial housing project began in 1934 and opened in 1937.%0a%3c %0a%3c Into the 1940s and 1950s, the growing Liberty City and adjacent Brownsville thrived as a middle income black American community, hosting several churches, hospitals, and community centers. The area served as home to prominent figures such as Kelsey Pharr, M. Athalie Range (the first black American elected to serve on the Miami city commission) and boxer Muhammad Ali. Although segregation laws prohibited black Americans from resting and residing in popular Miami Beach, service establishment and resorts such as the Hampton House Motel and Villas catered to and entertained the likes of notables such as Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Althea Gibson, and even whites such as Mickey Mantle.%0a%3c %0a%3c Construction of Interstate 95 in Florida in Overtown and declining use of restrictive covenants in the wake of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 dramatically altered the neighborhood into the 1960s. Increasing numbers of lower income elderly and welfare-dependent families migrated to the Liberty City neighborhood following their displacement primarily from inner city Overtown, leading to large-scale black flight of middle and higher income blacks and other blacks like West Indian Americans largely to suburban areas like Florida City and Miami Gardens in southern and northern Dade County, respectively.%0a%3c %0a%3c Crime grew prevalent in the increasingly poverty-stricken area in the immediate post–civil rights movement era of the 1960s and 1970s. The ensuing problems of the poor and disenfranchised grew most apparent and notable in race riots which occurred in Liberty City in August 1968 during the Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, and in 1980 following the acquittal of police officers charged with the killing of Arthur McDuffie.%0a%3c %0a%3c The plight of inner-city black Miamians increasingly came to be highlighted in national press into the 1980s as the Hurricanes football team of the University of Miami won several national college football championships led by players recruited from the mostly black, lower income neighborhoods such as Liberty City and Overtown. National exposure continued with the popularity of nationally broadcast programs such as the NBC crime drama Miami Vice, which brought the deteriorating conditions of the area to greater prominence.%0a%3c %0a%3c Into the 1990s and 2000s, the music grew to reflect the area with locals such as Luther Campbell of 2 Live Crew pioneering the Miami bass genre which dominated Southern hip hop music during the decade. Other music and sports talents rose to national prominence from the area such as rappers Trina and Trick Daddy and NFL players Chad "Ocho Cinco" Johnson, and Willis McGahee.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a%3c *%0a%3c *%0a%3c !!!!'''Average Resources''' • to ••%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Locations'''%0a%3c *Miami Dade College%0a%3c *Model City Library%0a%3c *Sandrell Rivers Theater%0a%3c *Charles Hardley Park%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25''Buena Vista''%0a%3c %0a%3c In the 1890s, Buena Vista was a small village whose founding and growth paralleled Miami's. During the Land Boom of the 1920s, the area was developed as the Biltmore and Shadowlawn subdivisions. Originally home to many Florida cracker immigrants from Georgia and North Carolina, the neighborhood soon became popular with the owners of nearby businesses. The houses reflect their original owners' rising social status and include fine examples of Mediterranean Revival, Mission, Craftsman, and Art Deco architecture style residences.%0a%3c %0a%3c Buena Vista, Lemon City, and Little River were founded before the turn of the 19th-century and represent some of the earliest settlements in Miami-Dade County. The area known as Buena Vista was once a small village adjoining, but not within the corporate limits of Miami proper. Although preceded in age by pioneer Lemon City, a town located a little further north, the small village of Buena Vista dates its birth, development, and growth along with Miami’s. The founding of Buena Vista dates back to the days when the immense rock ridge extending between the Atlantic Ocean and the Florida Everglades was covered by a dense pine forest. The earliest history of the village is recorded in a survey made by government surveyors, and the locations of the land tracts are to this date still founded on this early document.%0a%3c The land which became Buena Vista was originally part of the homesteads of William Henry Gleason and E.L. White. Gleason, a prominent and somewhat notorious figure in early Miami-Dade County politics, arrived in Miami after the Civil War was elected Lieutenant Governor of Florida. He left the area in 1876 but retained his homestead for several years, eventually turning it over to his son. As early as 1892, E.L. White homesteaded the area from North 41st Street to 54th Street between West 2nd Avenue and East 2nd Avenue. This was the area from which the Biltmore and Shadowlawn Subdivisions, which today make up the "Buena Vista East Historic District", were carved in the early 1920s.%0a%3c %0a%3c The arrival of the railroad in 1896 marked the end of an era for the pioneer bayfront village of Lemon City, which had enjoyed tremendous importance to the Miami area by virtue of its docks. Now the train brought much needed supplies to the rest of Dade County, and lured people away from the bayfront community to Miami and its outlying areas. The Lemon City depot, built in 1896, drew business further west away from the bay, and the small village of Buena Vista gradually developed. One of the earliest subdivisions in the Buena Vista areas was the Buena Vista Biscayne Badger Club Subdivision, which was developed in 1910 as a bayfront community with a private water plant, streets, and a park with recreation dock on the bay. However, it was inland where the village took shape. By 1910, suburban Buena Vista could boast of one hotel known as the Courley House, its very own railroad depot on the Florida East Coast Railway line, a small post office building, tropical fruit groves, a fruit-packing house, a grocery store, and one religious institution, the Holy Cross Episcopal Church.%0a%3c %0a%3c Other prominent citizens acquired land in Buena Vista. Among them was the millionaire, Charles Deering, who purchased a large tract of bayfront land east of the railroad, in the area now known as the Upper Eastside. This land is where the "Baypoint" neighborhood is now located. Much of the area fronting the bay was naturally wooded, and here Deering created an arboretum and sanctuary for birds and animals. There were no public roadways in the area east of the railroad, and since Deering strongly opposed the opening of such streets, the area was preserved in its pristine, virgin state for many years.%0a%3c %0a%3c As the population of Miami grew between the late 1910s through the Boom era of the early 1920s, new areas reached northward along the old Dixie Highway (N.E. 2nd Avenue) and Avenue D (N. Miami Avenue), which was extended northward from N.E. 36th Street. The northern city limit of Miami was moved to N.E. 38th Street, and this took in a part of Buena Vista. Finally, on August 4, 1924, the new town of Buena Vista was incorporated and, together with the other incorporated areas of Coconut Grove and Silver Bluff, was annexed to the City of Miami the following year.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a%3c *%0a%3c *%0a%3c !!!!'''Average Resources''' ••%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Locations'''%0a%3c *Buena Vista East Historic District%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25''Morning Side''%0a%3c %0a%3c Started in the 1920s as "Bay Shore," it prospered in the mid-20th century and fell on hard times along with most of Miami's other inner city neighborhoods in the 60's and 70's. More recently Morningside was the first historic area in central Miami to experience gentrification with an influx of more-affluent residents. It has now been fully restored. The Morningside Historic District runs from NE 55th Street to NE 60th Street; it was the first historic district to be designated as such in the City of Miami. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992 as the Bay Shore Historic District.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Morningside Historic District is significant to the history of architecture, landscape architecture, and community development in Miami. Developed primarily between 1922 and 1941, Morningside contains a wealth of Mediterranean, Art Deco, and vernacular style houses that reflect the diversity and direction of architectural design during the 1920s and 1930s. Morningside is one of Miami's best planned subdivisions, featuring wide, tree-lined boulevards that contribute to the character of the area. This neighborhood was envisioned as an exclusive, residential community, and its amenities and location on Biscayne Bay attracted many influential and prominent local residents. One of Miami's most intact historic neighborhoods, Morningside is the City's best remaining example of a boom-era suburb.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Morningside Historic District stands today as one of Miami's most intact historic neighborhoods. Despite the number of post-1941 buildings in the area, Morningside retains a high degree of historic and architectural integrity. This is due, in part, to the fact that most later buildings are not intrusive, but respect the earlier structures in scale, setback, materials, and workmanship. The majority of neighborhood residents recognize the special character of the area and desire its continued preservation.%0a%3c %0a%3c As Miami's population expanded during the late 1920s and early 1920s, new subdivisions reached northward along Biscayne Bay. In 1922, a large, undeveloped bayfront tract near the northern city limits was platted. Called Bay Shore, this area was subdivided by the Bay Shore Investment Company and was the first of three phases that would be developed by the company between 1922 and 1924.Houses constructed in the Morningside Historic District reflect the eclecticism popular in the early twentieth century. The earlier buildings in the district are predominantly Mediterranean Revival in style, while structures built in the 1930s and early 1940s are frequently Art Deco. Outstanding examples of both styles are found here. Morningside also features a large number of masonry vernacular buildings that frequently utilize elements of several styles. An unusual Tudor Revival style house and one of the City's best examples of Mission style architecture add to the area's architectural diversity.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a%3c *%0a%3c *%0a%3c !!!!'''Average Resources''' •••%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Locations'''%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25''Bay Point''%25%25%0a%3c %0a%3c The Bayside Historic District reflects the formative years of the early 1900s through the mid-1940s.

These subdivisions include Elmira (N.E. 68th Street and N.E. 67th Street), which was platted in 1909; Acadia (N.E. 70th Street), which was platted in 1915; Baywood (N.E. 69th Street and the south side of N.E. 71st Street), which was platted in 1921 and added to in 1924; and Washington Place (N.E. 72nd Street and the north side of N.E. 71st Street), which was platted in 1925.%0a%3c %0a%3c In 1909, William B. and Fred C.

The Millers had come to Florida in the late 1880s from Elmira, New York and had developed Elmira Farms near Arch Creek. Their new subdivision was named Elmira, and oolitic limestone gates announced the entrance to the new community.%0a%3c %0a%3c While much of what was Lemon City has been engulfed by later developments, Elmira has remained virtually intact. Although many of its houses have deteriorated, and newer buildings have been added, the street retains much of its early character. Elmira is characterized by its excellent collection of Frame Vernacular buildings, many of which were inspired by Northern architectural styles. The Elmira Club at 742 N.E. 68th Street, for example, has Dutch Colonial Revival influences, while other houses display classical details. The majority of houses were constructed in the 1910s.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Acadia subdivision was platted in 1915 by the Realty Securities Corporation and George E. Merrick. Although the subdivision evokes the memory of Longfellow with such names as Acadian Way, Evangeline Circle, Tropical Trail, and Druid Walk, the houses developed here are distinctly Mediterranean Revival in influence. This is due perhaps to the fact that only two houses were constructed prior to 1925. Development took off during the Boom years of the mid-1920s, however, when Wykoff and Estes Builders constructed an outstanding cluster of large, two-story Mediterranean Revival style houses near the eastern end of NE 70th Street.%0a%3c %0a%3c The last subdivision to be subdivided was Washington Place, which was also developed between 1925 and the mid-1940s. Samuel J. Prescott, who platted the subdivision in 1925, had constructed his own winter home at 7101 N.E. 10th Avenue some years before. The house remains today as one of the last intact bayfront estates in Northeast Miami. The estate once featured a recreational golf course for residents and guests. Prescott was founder of the firm of Samuel J. Prescott Co., Inc., building contractors, which developed several significant buildings in downtown Washington, D.C. Prescott was chairman of the board of the Second National Bank of Washington, D.C., president of the Master Builders Association, the Builders and Manufacturers Exchange, and the Prescott Farms Company of New Hampshire.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Bayside Historic District remains today as an intact, cohesive neighborhood. Despite the number of post-1941 buildings, Bayside retains a high level of historic and architectural integrity.%0a%3c Houses constructed in Bayside reflect the diversity, direction, and taste of individual residents as well as the architectural eclecticism prevalent in the early-20th century. The earlier buildings in the district are Frame Vernacular, with several examples of early bungalows. Houses built in the 1920s are generally Mediterranean Revival in style, while structures built in the 1930s and 1940s are frequently Art Deco. Bayside also features a number of excellent examples of other architectural styles, including Mission Revival, Streamline Moderne, and Florida Ranch. Other structures, best described as Masonry Vernacular, add to the area's architectural diversity.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a%3c *%0a%3c *%0a%3c !!!!'''Average Resources''' •••%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Locations'''%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25''Midtown''%25%25%0a%3c %0a%3c Midtown Miami is the collective term for the Wynwood and Edgewater neighborhoods of Miami, Florida, United States, north of Downtown and south of the Miami Design District.

The project is a large-scale, urban development that was planned with 8 high-rise residential buildings, a hotel, two parks, and a major urban shopping area, "The Shops at Midtown". Due to the collapse of the real estate bubble in 2007, only two residential buildings, and about 2/3 of "The Shops at Midtown" were built. In July 2011, plans were announced to begin construction on a new entertainment center at Midtown, including a hotel, and shops on the site of the current temporary park in the center of Midtown. Critics of Midtown state the lack of parks as a major issue.%0a%3c %0a%3c Midtown has grown quickly, and is home to Shops at Midtown, an outdoor shopping area designed to mimic New York's SOHO neighborhood, and home to many national and local stores and restaurants including Target, Guess, HomeGoods, Marshalls, Sakaya Kitchen, Baru Urbano, Novecento & IT Lounge, Riviera Focacceria Italiana, Giraffas Brazilian Grill, Spris, Bar Louie, Wine Vault, 100 Montaditos, World of Beer, Chef Leon, Mercado Latino, My Ceviche, Five Guys Burgers & Fries, 4D Gelateria, Hurricane Grill & Wings, Lime Fresh Mexican Grill, Spun Candy, Pinkberry, SugarCane, Mercadito, Lagniappe, Sustain, Cheese Course, Buro Miami, Ring Finger Studio, and an abundance of upscale apartments. A fair amount of office businesses have also taken up residence in Midtown in office buildings, in industries ranging from interior decor to marketing agency services, and more. At Büro Urbano urban workspace, office spaces are provided for small businesses. Midtown has also become home to Art Miami art fair, which takes place during Miami's Art Basel week.%0a%3c %0a%3c On 1 August 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a travel warning, advising pregnant women not to visit Midtown Miami, the Design District and Wynwood areas to avoid getting the Zika virus.

By 2007 Bacardi USA agreed to lease a complex in Coral Gables to use as its new headquarters. At that time, Bacardi had employees in seven buildings across South Florida. Bacardi vacated its former headquarters buildings. Miami citizens began a campaign to label the buildings as historic. Allan T. Schulman, a professor of architecture at the University of Miami, said "Miami's brand is its identity as a tropical city. The Bacardi buildings are exactly the sort that resonate with our consciousness of what Miami is about."  In 2007 Chad Oppenheim, the head of Oppenheim Architecture + Design, described the Bacardi buildings as "elegant, with a Modernist [look combined with] a local flavor." In late 2012, the National YoungArts Foundation purchased the storied Bacardi buildings and converted them into their national headquarters%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Neighborhood claimed by'''%0a%3c *%0a%3c *%0a%3c !!!!'''Average Resources''' ••••%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!'''Locations'''%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c *Link%0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25''Design District''%25%25%0a%3c %0a%3c The Miami Design District is a neighborhood in Miami, Florida, United States and a shopping, dining and cultural destination.

Wynwood is roughly divided by North 20th Street to the south, I-195 to the north, I-95 to the west and the Florida East Coast Railway to the east.%0a%3c %0a%3c Wynwood was long referred to as "Little San Juan", and commonly known as "El Barrio" as many Puerto Ricans began immigrating to this Miami neighborhood from the island and northeastern cities in the 1950s. Puerto Rican-owned restaurants, shops, markets and other businesses line the streets of Wynwood. Since the early 2000s, the neighborhood has seen a rising amount of investments and attention, expanding the scope of the region. The Midtown Miami development construction began in 2005 between North 29th and 36th Street and Miami Avenue and the Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) on what was historically an FEC rail yard. This brought renewed attention to the area, and previously abandoned warehouses have begun to be occupied by artists, restaurants, cafés, and lounges. Tony Goldman, a developer, also assisted in the growth of Wynwood by creating a mecca out of the already present graffiti. In 2009, artists commissioned by Goldman helped create the Wynwood Walls.
