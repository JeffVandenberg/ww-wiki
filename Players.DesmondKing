While his brother grew up as the straight and narrow sort, usually following the rules, Desmond found his attention by being the black sheep. He wasn't overly argumentative, at least not in his own eyes. Sure, he preferred to respond with a healthy dosage of dry wit and sarcasm, but nothing aggressive or anything of the sort. However, that never seemed to gain him a large deal of affection from those outside of his family or those within; his father seemed to desire that he was more like his older brother. %0a%0a%25white%25That never seemed to happen. Not for the most part. While his brother went off to Uni, he was barely passing highschool and, once he did, he never seemed to gain any interest in advancing his academic career much further. That certainly didn't help his relationship with his father, because once again, his brother seemed to be excelling in that as well. His mother, at the very least, just figured he hadn't found his niche in life yet. Which was semi-in-part true. %0a%0a%25white%25Eventually, he figured he would appease his father and join in his brother's foot steps, by joining the armed services. If he wasn't going to be a warrior as a wolf (as he figured he would be a wolfblood the rest of his life), he might as well become a warrior in other ways. Part of him just wanted to make his older brother, Everett, proud of him if anything. But, after graduating from boot and serving a single term in Afghanistan, Desmond once again felt that he didn't have a future in such a regimented and structured organization.%0a%0a%25white%25Unsurprisingly enough, he got discharged.

He found himself back in London and hanging with a group of ill repute. Next thing turned to the next and Desmond was basically involved in organized crime as an associate. After a few stick up jobs and B&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;E's, his crew thought it would be a good idea to steal from a well known criminal family. The mafia, if you will. A shipment of cocaine was coming into town. They knew where the drop off was and they wanted a cut of that money. They were going to steal it. A small group could get in and out without anybody knowing.%0a%0a%25white%25Desmond was stupid enough to volunteer.%0a%0a%25white%25Long story short, as Dez and the group snuck into a seemingly empty warehouse and found the cargo within a shipping truck.. members of the mafia who were supposed to be guarding it showed back up from a quick fast food run. Just as quickly as Desmond's crew turned around to see the bright lights of a parking vehicle, they were gunned down by automatic gun fire.%0a%0a%25white%25And that would've been the end of poor Desmond's life, lying there, spitting up his own blood and staring at the moon.. if Luna didn't grant him the same rage that had been blessed and cursed upon his brother and father before him.
