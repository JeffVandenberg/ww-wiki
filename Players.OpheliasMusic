The song is about a magical kingdom under the sea, and the struggle to survive.%0a%3c %0a%3c (:cell width=360px:) %25lfloat width=150%25 https://i.imgur.com/qvb0E3j.jpg%0a%3c %25green%25[[https://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/dieroller.php?action=view_roll&r=556572|You Saved Me]] \\%0a%3c %25yellow%259 successes \\%0a%3c %25white%25 Typical pop song as it starts but clearly goes to so much more as O starts to sing.  There is true unbridled passion in her voice, and a raw emotion as she describes the man who saved her life.  There is a dreamy quality to it that sucks the listener in.%0a%3c %0a%3c (:cellnr width=360px:) %25lfloat width=150%25 https://i.imgur.com/oeCAWaY.jpg%0a%3c %25green%25[[https://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/dieroller.php?action=view_roll&r=556573|Ice Cream Pie]] \\%0a%3c %25yellow%255 successes \\%0a%3c %25white%25 This song is your very typical pop song.  Very chipper and happy about different kinds of ice cream made up into a pie, so that everyone gets their favorite ice cream in their slice%0a%3c %0a%3c (:cell width=360px:) %25lfloat width=150%25 https://i.imgur.com/Pj2hGCp.jpg%0a%3c %25green%25[[https://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/dieroller.php?action=view_roll&r=556574|The Escape]] \\%0a%3c %25yellow%257 successes \\%0a%3c %25white%25 Another pop/techno mix of music.  About escaping from a dangerous situation, and the feeling of needing to save others, instead of just every person for themselves kind.  About putting other people's safety and freedom above your own.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (:tableend:)%0a
