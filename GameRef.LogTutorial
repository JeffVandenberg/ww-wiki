Now with pictures!!!  You will need a Google account, for the google docs to save the logs and share them easily.  %0a%0a!!%25center%25''Step One''%0a%0aFor the google Doc's page, open a blank sheet%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/Fnygltm.png%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Step Two''%0a%0aName the google doc, I typically name it the name Scene: whatever the scene is called from the calendar, along with the date if its a ST or PRP scene.  If not just come up with a name that makes since.  Adding the Date is always a good idea.%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/NsnQc5v.png%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Step Three''%0a%0aWhile in the room, use your mouse and highlight over the text in the room, then copy it.  You can right click and select copy, or use Ctrl + C.  Try and include the Icon's because they do transfer over to the google doc!  It makes searching visually easier in the log for who said what later.%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/JPeQZzb.png%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Step Four''%0a%0aGo back to the google doc, and on the main body, paste the logs from the chat.  You can again right click and select paste, or you can use Ctrl + V from your keyboard.  Now it will show up with the colors and everything from the chat itself, and the icons.%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/9wRsu9b.png%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Step Five''%0a%0aAfter you pasted the logs.  Highlight it again and then right click on the text and down at the bottom of the menu is the "Clear Formatting" option.  Select that and like magic, it makes all the font black, so those who don't change their font on chat are no longer white!%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/IA6Xakc.png%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Step Six''%0a%0aSee!  Nice black text and easy to read!%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/MviE1kz.png%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Step Seven''%0a%0aNow if you need to add more text to the log, just repeat steps Three, Four and Five!  Be sure to copy from the new ones that you don't have on the log. Which if its a long scene I would suggest doing this a couple times as the room will eventually scroll past.  Now the transcript button will show all the logs from the point you when you entered the room.  But it also shows your PM's and it is hard to copy and paste and ends up.. funky and hard to read.%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/NwiTm7J.png%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Step Eight''%0a%0aJust paste and clear the formatting again like we went over before.  You can highlight the whole thing and clear formatting without causing any issues.  %0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/S3xfVGP.png%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Step Nine''%0a%0aJust select the whole thing again, and right click and find the clear formatting on the menu%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/ukeTEhF.png%0a%0a!!%25center%25''Step Ten''%0a%0aNow once you're done with the log.  Up in the top right hand page you will see a blue button called SHARE.  Click on that and the Get shareable link on the pop up.  You just copy the code it gives you.  Then anyone you share with with can see the logs.  Perfect for XP requests, or submitting logs for other things.%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/aFkdCAE.png%0a%0a(:include GameRef.Directoryhelp:)
