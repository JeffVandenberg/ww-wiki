His black hair is normally kept at about chin length and has a natural curl it it.  His eyes seem to shift color with what he is wearing or perhaps the environment they range from a very dark color which borders on almost black to a more vibrant green.  He wears a smirk with much more ease than a full blown smile which seems to be more reserved for his wife.  Under his clothing his body is one of very little fat and has muscles born of amazing genetics and hard work.  His skin is, like with most Talons, a road map telling the back streets and highways of violence and pain.%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/6qKOgkk.jpg%0a%0a%25werewolf%25 In Gauru form, Devours is much larger than his 5'8 and now rises easily at just under 9 feet tall.  His hair all black with long gleaming claws which have been sharpened by rending the bone and flesh of foe since his first change.  His hair is long and soft and if in the wind will blow around when not held down to his tough flesh by blood and gristle.%0a%0a%25Center%25https://i.imgur.com/9Qw0e3a.jpg%0a%0a%25werewolf%25In Urshul, Devours stands 5'6 at the shoulder and with powerful front shoulders he appears to be even more bulky than most normal Urshul forms.  His hair is much more coarse yet still black in this form.  When walking slowly on any hard service his thick claws make the constant clacking sound as they battle with the ground beneath them.  His eyes show a constant hunger in this form with a substantial amount of moisture around his mouth at all times.%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/L2OVd0M.jpg%0a%0a%25werewolf%25In Dalu, Devours the Bleeding Heart is only about 6 and a half feet tall, still often smaller than many of his other Talon brethren.  His arms thicken up as do his legs.  His hands become large enough to easily palm a basketball or large mans face, the second much more often used, he isnt teen wolf afterall.  The fact hes not natural is hard to hide in this form.  His chest appears as if his sternum has become thicker and presses at his flesh creating a wishbone effect if you can see his torso.  His shoulders rise and fall as if every breath in this form is painful.%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/5Tyfptn.jpg%0a%0a%25werewolf%25In Urhan, Devours bears the melanistic color deviation of the common gray wolf.  His soft fur all black soft to the touch and well cared for.  He is of average size of his normal wolf cousins and when running among them would be impossible to distinguish from the rest unless you could see his eyes.  When looking at his Urhan eyes you can see something behind them that belies the exterior.%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=5px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=250px height=350px%25https://i.imgur.com/4xKTMG5.jpg%0a!%25werewolf%25  Hooks:%0a%25werewolf%25'''Cut from a hardened Talon(Werewolves):''' Devours was once not only an avid hunter of the Pure but other werewolves who defied the laws of the society, he was what some would call zealous about his work.  If you come from or have drifted through the Southern California area than its possible you might have heard of him.  %0a%0a%25werewolf%25'''One kills a man, one is an assassin; one kills millions, one is a conqueror; one kills everybody, one is a god (Military / Political / Criminal):''' Devours once lived a life hes long left behind.  Having once worked for the DCS (Defense Clandestine Service) an arm of the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) Devours joined, went to new and interesting places, met new and interesting people and killed them.  He did this for the US and for its NATOs allies.  Once he left the service, for a few years he worked as a private contractor which at times put him in a bit of a gray area when it came to legality.  These days are behind him, but people he encountered within the government or other sectors still exist and may well recognize him or know of his work.%0a%0a%25werewolf%25'''Always in Need of Work:(Everyone)''' He lives a new life now and that is a life of a much more peaceful bent.  He works with wood and creates.  He does handyman work, works on construction crews, house framing and even the finer woodworking projects which includes furniture making.  If you need anything from a planter box to a house built, Jericho is your man of the house.  Just dont tell his wife if you want planter boxes, shes been trying to get her 6 boxes made for quite awhile now and things just keep coming up.%0a%0a%25werewolf%25'''Sympathetic Understanding:(Everyone)''' To meet Jericho you might not think it, but he actually holds a large amount of compassion in his heart and this is never more readily shown than when with children, the elderly or the disabled.  He can often be found doing work for people with children who are less fortunate, for the elderly in his area or that he encounters and of course for the disabled.  Breaking roots with many of the Talons beliefs about weakness and sickness he looks to care for all.  Maybe you've seen him helping someone out or you know someone he needs something done.%0a%0a%25werewolf%25'''The Land Which Releases the Burden:(Werewolves)''' Jericho and his wife Bryna own a large piece of real estate at the edge of Forest Park and this piece of property they own contains a powerful Locus.  Of the Loci in the city this one ranks up there for power.  The property was owned originally by his mother in law who had the house built specifically to house a pack.  Devours and Bryna are now looking to establish their own pack around this Locus.  The seclusion around the house makes it a perfect place to let your wolf loose.  Those who need a pack may find themselves drawn to the power of the Locus.%0a%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=5px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=250px height=350px%25https://i.imgur.com/bFtGzCP.jpg%0a!%25werewolf%25Those Who are Closest%0a%0a%25werewolf%25Not many in the world really know Jericho Devours the Bleeding Heart Harper any longer.  He has left behind most everything when he came to Portland with his wife, Bryna and her service animal, Studdly the Raccoon (Yes, seriously!  And hes a little asshole).  He like many wolves however craves the pack, craves a family so hopefully Portland will be good for them.  Being a staunchly loyal person he has never accrued a large number of friends as that is just too taxing.  Given his former line of work he learned early one, if you dont want to lie to your loved ones, dont have loved ones.  Times are a changin'%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/030tQ48.jpg%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/oll4anm.png%0a%0a%0a%0a(:table:)%0a(:cellnr width=50%25 align=left style='padding-right: 10px;':)%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=4px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=7px width=100%25 https://i.imgur.com/9HJ2s1a.png%0a%25werewolf%25 '''[[https://wantonwicked.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/?n=Players.BrynaHarper|%25werewolf%25Bryna Harper - Talon Blooded Wife]]''' \\%0a%25werewolf%25There is nothing I can say that wont pale in comparison to meeting her in person.

Bryna Harper\\%0a> %25werewolf%25This is Jerichos life, his soul, his mate and his wife by law.  Wanted by so few within the blood he saw past the illness which afflicts and wanted a life with her.  He has given up so much for Bryna, he would give up more if it meant keeping her safe.  Bryna is both kind and compassionate and his counterbalance.  She is the light to his darkness and without Bryna he is aware of the downward spiral he would fall into.  A Talon Blooded who has a sickness which will never be cured is not a blooded who is ever held in high regard.  She was never believed to be mated and honestly until he met her, Devours never really wanted to be mated.  The idea didnt appeal to his sense of life.  It would require too much work which was work he couldnt dedicate to things like the pack and of course hunting the Pure.  Brynas brother was Devours former Pack Leader, the pack which Devours was a strong Beta within, a position he relished.  Things were perfect for everyone involved until Bryna, the photographer came back home.  She secretly disgusted her brother and most of the other pack.  She however inspired something inside Devours.  This worried the pack, she wasnt good breeding material and as the years passed and the two become closer and closer and Devours stopped looking for others her brother, Riley took it upon himself to fix this.  He would show Devours just how sick his sister was.  Being a type I diabetic she required her insulin in high doses and he altered her meds.  What she was taking was not Insulin.  She fell into a diabetic coma.  It wasnt long before Devours figured it out and he nearly beat his Alpha to death.  The rest of the pack jumped in and he did his best to fight them all.  Thankfully he couldnt which meant no one died that day.  He went to the hospital and sat with her till she came out of the coma.  As soon as she did they left LA, got themselves married and have finally found their way to Portland.  She is what keeps him grounded.%0a> %0a106,110d107%0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=4px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=7px width=100%25 https://i.imgur.com/9HJ2s1a.png%0a%3c %25werewolf%25 '''[[Bryna Harper|%25werewolf%25Talon Blooded Wife]]''' \\%0a%3c %25werewolf%25There is nothing I can say that wont pale in comparison to meeting her in person.

Bryna Harper\\%0a%3c %25werewolf%25This is Jerichos life, his soul, his mate and his wife by law.  Wanted by so few within the blood he saw past the illness which afflicts and wanted a life with her.  He has given up so much for Bryna, he would give up more if it meant keeping her safe.  Bryna is both kind and compassionate and his counterbalance.  She is the light to his darkness and without Bryna he is aware of the downward spiral he would fall into.  A Talon Blooded who has a sickness which will never be cured is not a blooded who is ever held in high regard.  She was never believed to be mated and honestly until he met her, Devours never really wanted to be mated.  The idea didnt appeal to his sense of life.  It would require too much work which was work he couldnt dedicate to things like the pack and of course hunting the Pure.  Brynas brother was Devours former Pack Leader, the pack which Devours was a strong Beta within, a position he relished.  Things were perfect for everyone involved until Bryna, the photographer came back home.  She secretly disgusted her brother and most of the other pack.  She however inspired something inside Devours.  This worried the pack, she wasnt good breeding material and as the years passed and the two become closer and closer and Devours stopped looking for others her brother, Riley took it upon himself to fix this.  He would show Devours just how sick his sister was.  Being a type I diabetic she required her insulin in high doses and he altered her meds.  What she was taking was not Insulin.  She fell into a diabetic coma.  It wasnt long before Devours figured it out and he nearly beat his Alpha to death.  The rest of the pack jumped in and he did his best to fight them all.  Thankfully he couldnt which meant no one died that day.  He went to the hospital and sat with her till she came out of the coma.  As soon as she did they left LA, got themselves married and have finally found their way to Portland.  She is what keeps him grounded.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=5px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=250px height=350px%25%0a%3c %0a---%0a> %0a111c106%0a%3c %25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=250px height=350px%25https://i.imgur.com/0iFFhv3.jpg%0a---%0a> %25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=250px height=350px%25https://i.imgur.com/58phfCb.jpg%0a116c111%0a%3c *%25werewolf%25 ''"Steadfast.

His black hair is normally kept at about chin length and has a natural curl it it.  His eyes seem to shift color with what he is wearing or perhaps the environment and range from a very dark color which borders on almost black to a more vibrant green.  He wears a smirk with much more ease than a full blown smile which seems to be more reserved for his wife.  Under his clothing his body is one of very little fat and has muscles born of amazing genetics and hard work.  His skin is, like with most Talons, a road map telling the back streets and highways of violence and pain.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25https://i.imgur.com/6qKOgkk.jpg%0a%3c %0a%3c %25werewolf%25 In Gauru form, Devours is much larger than his 5'8 and now rises easily at just under 9 feet tall.  His hair all black with long gleaming claws which have been sharpened by rending the bone and flesh of foe since his first change.  His hair is long and soft and if in the wind will blow around when not held down to his tough flesh by blood and gristle.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25Center%25https://i.imgur.com/9Qw0e3a.jpg%0a%3c %0a%3c %25werewolf%25In Urshul, Devours stands 5'6 at the shoulder and with powerful front shoulders he appears to be even more bulky than most normal Urshul forms.  His hair is much more coarse yet still black in this form.  When walking slowly on any hard service his thick claws make the constant clacking sound as they battle with the ground beneath them.  His eyes show a constant hunger in this form with a substantial amount of moisture around his mouth at all times.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25https://i.imgur.com/L2OVd0M.jpg%0a%3c %0a%3c %25werewolf%25In Dalu, Devours the Bleeding Heart is only about 6 and a half feet tall, still often smaller than many of his other Talon brethren.  His arms thicken up as do his legs.  His hands become large enough to easily palm a basketball or large mans face, the second much more often used, he isnt teen wolf afterall.  The fact hes not natural is hard to hide in this form.  His chest appears as if his sternum has become thicker and presses at his flesh creating a wishbone effect if you can see his torso.  His shoulders rise and fall as if every breath in this form is painful.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25center%25https://i.imgur.com/5Tyfptn.jpg%0a%3c %0a%3c %25werewolf%25In Urhan, Devours bears the melanistic color deviation of the common gray wolf.  His soft fur all black soft to the touch and well cared for.  He is of average size of his normal wolf cousins and when running among them would be impossible to distinguish from the rest unless you could see his eyes.  When looking at his Urhan eyes you can see something behind them that belies the exterior.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=5px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=250px height=350px%25https://i.imgur.com/4xKTMG5.jpg%0a---%0a> %25white%25Blonde undercut hair is usually slicked back when he wants to project a more professional appearence, but the majority of the time Bishop's hair is left wild and free along with the immaculately sculpted beard.

If you come from or have drifted through the Southern California area than its possible you might have heard of him.  %0a%3c %0a%3c %25werewolf%25'''One kills a man, one is an assassin; one kills millions, one is a conqueror; one kills everybody, one is a god (Military / Political / Criminal):''' Devours once lived a life hes long left behind.  Having once worked for the DCS (Defense Clandestine Service) an arm of the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) Devours joined, went to new and interesting places, met new and interesting people and killed them.  He did this for the US and for its NATOs allies.  Once he left the service, for a few years he worked as a private contractor which at times put him in a bit of a gray area when it came to legality.  These days are behind him, but people he encountered within the government or other sectors still exist and may well recognize him or know of his work.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25werewolf%25'''Always in Need of Work:(Everyone)''' He lives a new life now and that is a life of a much more peaceful bent.  He works with wood and creates.  He does handyman work, works on construction crews, house framing and even the finer woodworking projects which includes furniture making.  If you need anything from a planter box to a house built, Jericho is your man of the house.  Just dont tell his wife if you want planter boxes, shes been trying to get her 6 boxes made for quite awhile now and things just keep coming up.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25werewolf%25'''Sympathetic Understanding:(Everyone)''' To meet Jericho you might not think it, but he actually holds a large amount of compassion in his heart and this is never more readily shown than when with children, the elderly or the disabled.  He can often be found doing work for people with children who are less fortunate, for the elderly in his area or that he encounters and of course for the disabled.  Breaking roots with many of the Talons beliefs about weakness and sickness he looks to care for all.  Maybe you've seen him helping someone out or you know someone he needs something done.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25werewolf%25'''The Land Which Releases the Burden:(Werewolves)''' Jericho and his wife Bryna own a large piece of real estate at the edge of Forest Park and this piece of property they own contains a powerful Locus.  Of the Loci in the city this one ranks up there for power.  The property was owned originally by his mother in law who had the house built specifically to house a pack.  Devours and Bryna are now looking to establish their own pack around this Locus.  The seclusion around the house makes it a perfect place to let your wolf loose.  Those who need a pack may find themselves drawn to the power of the Locus.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=5px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=250px height=350px%25https://i.imgur.com/bFtGzCP.jpg%0a%3c !%25werewolf%25Those Who are Closest%0a%3c %0a%3c Not many in the world really know Jericho Devours the Bleeding Heart Harper any longer.

Never the best, but they always played hard.

You might find him.%0a> %0a> %25werewolf%25'''The Great Hunt:(Werewolves/Blood Talons)''' Bishop has a burning hatred for all things Pure including their totems and spirit allies. He describes himself in a constant state of hunting. Have any tips on the Pure or their allies, then Bishop will no doubt tag along to see them properly treated.%0a
