His eyes glow with a fiery menace, his hair crackling embers. Each finger is tipped with a thick, ragged talon that glitters like obsidian.  From his shoulders, a pair of wings are generally folded against his body.  The tattered remains of what once were functional wings just a ghost of flight for him now. The veins of magma and the flames that covered his body shifted color with his mood, from a dull red/orange when he was calm to a bright blue when excited... or a crackling orange/yellow enraged.  %0a%0a|| %25color=#0094E5%25Height:||6'4"|| %25color=#FF4B0F%25Weight:||270lbs|| %25color=#0094E5%25Complexion:||Tanned|| %25color=#FF4B0F%25Hair Color:||Salt and Pepper||%0a|| %25color=#0094E5%25Eye Color:||Amber|| %25color=#FF4B0F%25Apparent Age:||30ish|| %25color=#0094E5%25Age:||30ish|| %25color=#FF4B0F%25Accent:||None||%0a|| %25color=#0094E5%25Build Type:||Lean|| %25color=#FF4B0F%25Scars:||None|| %25color=#0094E5%25Tattoos:||Various|| %25color=#FF4B0F%25Piercings:||None Visible||%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/Oo5a6gp.png%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #8B008B' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=150px height=150px%25https://i.imgur.com/MCmHvFA.jpg%0a%0aKillian's a tall, broad man standing at least 6'4" and carries himself like he fills whatever room he's in.   He dresses well, even when it's just casual clothing.  He favors simple clothing that's easy to move around in.  Collared shirts over plain t-shirts with expensive jeans and boots.  He's a street thug who got money.  His lean form tended to stand in very relaxed poses, calculated to be that way.   Left hand tended to find itself in his pocket while his right hand hung free to gesture as he spoke.  There was just an ease to the way he moved.   He moved in slow, languid motions like a great Wyrm strolling through without a care in the world%0a%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/RhraRX2.png%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #8B008B' margin-top=0px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=25px width=200px height=200px%25https://i.imgur.com/gnIhtYY.png%0aKillian is a lot.   He demands attention, demands he's the center of the room whenever he's there.   The Mad King holds 'Court' wherever he goes, installing himself as the dynamic center of attention.  His voice is loud, booming and not unlike the mountain he was once a heart of... prone to suddenly exploding violently when enraged.  When he smiles, his whole face reflects it.  Some people speak with their hands... Killian's entire body gets in on the fun.  He's a dynamic speaker and commands attention with a booming voice and presence.  The man's entire presence is massive, explosive and overbearing. His confidence is near unshakable, infectious.  %0a%0aThe difference was, as always, production.  %0a(:div2end:)%0a-----%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/lqp2j8F.png%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #8B008B' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=300px height=300px%25https://i.imgur.com/dZ478Lu.jpg%0a*'''%25color=#0094E5%25The Mad King(Crime, Black Market)''': On the street, people tend to know that The Mad King knows people. He knows a lot of people and heâ€™s known for getting people what they need for often reasonable prices. Sometimes too reasonable. Sometimes you owe the Mad King a favor later. %0a*'''%25color=#FF4B0F%25More for the Hoard(Any)''':He's a collector of interesting things. That includes interesting Lost for the Mad Guard. The Dragon is seemingly always willing to add to his Hoard and tends to have the resources to make the deal possible. He's a regular of art shows and Auctions, often going without spending a dime and then suddenly deciding something minor is his next must have. %0a*'''%25color=#0094E5%25Raze and Burn(Lost)''': The Mad King watches over his hoard with the territorial rage one would expect. That extends, if rumors from Central Florida are to be believed, to anyone he decides is in that hoard. That, of course, includes his Motley, the Mad Guard. When his Hoard or any of ''his'' people are threatened, the Mad King's rage is explosive.  %0a*'''%25color=#FF4B0F%25For the Horde!(Knowledge of Supernatural)''': Killian, along with Boom-Boom and Roland, founded the Horde of Sovereigns, a group founded on the principles of mutual protection and sharing.   He's building a community of varied individuals and powerful people who are encouraged to themselves rise and gather powerful people around them.   A growing horde that stand together against the greater threats...%0a(:div2end:)%0a-----%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/SXcxk8y.gif%0a-----%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/xbp25cO.png%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid #8B008B' margin-top=0px margin-left=0px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=25px width=250px height=250px%25https://i.imgur.com/wMnPj1Q.jpg%0a%0a*%25color=#0094E5%25[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEaZkcwRDnE|Muthafucka]]%0a*%25color=#0094E5%25[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkwDOByqbKg|Thank God I'm not you]]%0a*%25color=#0094E5%25[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKdOpgYG610|Whatever doesn't kill me...]]%0a*%25color=#0094E5%25[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZJwRslmhe0|The Devil You Know]]%0a*%25color=#0094E5%25[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2ct_Gkq-HQ|Can't Go to Hell]]%0a*%25color=#0094E5%25[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmSygv3B1H0|Rascal King]]%0a(:div2end:)%0a-----%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/zzAx8Ci.png%0a(:table:)%0a(:cellnr width=50%25 align=left style='padding-right: 10px;':)%0a%25lfloat text-align=center margin-top=5px margin-right=4px margin-bottom=0px margin-left=0px width=75%25https://i.imgur.com/GdqKJSO.png%0a%25color=#0094E5%25[[BoomBoomCrash|Boom-Boom]]\\%0a%25white%25Best Damn Market find I ever had.
