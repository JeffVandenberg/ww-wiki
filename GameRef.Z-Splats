If you meet the prerequisites of an existing one, the actual joining can be done as a Bluebook or a PRP scene, submitted as an XP Expenditure (even if it normally doesn’t cost you anything). %0a*A character must be sanctioned at least a month before submitting a Z-Splat that requires any amount of customization.%0a*2nd Edition Z-Splats (Lodges, Entitlements, Bloodlines, Legacies) that are already published may be taken normally through whatever means is typical, if appropriate to the area and non-antagonistic. %0a*1st Edition official Z-Splats may be sent in to the Rulesmaster (as Custom Item/Power) with an attempt to convert them to fit the 2nd edition differences. Once the mechanics are worked out, the Storymasters will approve if they feel it makes sense for the current setting. Once approved, they may be joined like official 2nd edition Z-Splats, as if they already exist.%0a*Completely custom Z-Splats may be sent to the Rulesmaster and then Storymasters above, and will receive more scrutiny. You MUST meet the prerequisites to create an entirely custom Z-Splat IC, per the rules given in the respective books, as your character is creating it themself. There will be NO exceptions to this.%0a**Creating a custom Z-splat uses up your custom power creation for the month, and may not be submitted alongside other custom things.%0a**If the Z-Splat has custom powers of some kind, you’ll need a Justification for each dot of said powers, but these can be spread out over the course of you buying them. %0a**Lodges specifically need at least 2 founding members, as there’s no way to attract a powerful enough Totem (Rank 2+) without at least that many people.%0a**Entitlements will use the rules in the Chapter 3 document until we update them, but only need 2 people to form the initial Oath for a new one. %0a%0a[[#to1]]%0a%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25vampire%25'''Bloodlines'''%25%25%0a%0aThe following bloodlines from Onyx Path blogs are available:%0a*[[http://theonyxpath.com/the-jaws-of-the-beast/|Kerberoi]]%0a*[[http://theonyxpath.com/the-shadow-and-the-asp/|Khaibit]]%0a*[[http://theonyxpath.com/lonely-together/|Neglatu]]%0a%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''The Adrestoi''%0a%0aWhere is a man's ambition? In his heart? What if his heart be still? In his blood? What if that blood is clotted and stolen? The Children of Midas are dead men who suck ambition from the blood and marrow of the living. Like the gods of the Aztecs, they can turn blood to gold and gold to blood.The Adrestoi are creatures of the city, but more than that, creatures of its elite. They become one with its monoliths, command kine and beast alike. In death, they retain the vigor of life, but their will to power is dependent on the power of their blood. Fed well, an Adrestos is an irresistible force of command and conquest. Should he fail at the hunt, though, he becomes weak and easily swayed.%0a%0a!!!!Background:%0a%0aThe Adrestoi are a young bloodline, the product of their progenitor’s fierce will and the mutations that ancestor wrought in his own Blood. He spawned his brood and line young, and they have evolved together. In the Detroit of the 1980s, Paul Gordon was a man with a mission. Amid the decay of the great automotive firms and the fires that swept regularly through the neighborhoods where he grew up, Paul learned to impose will over fear. He traded his father’s blue collar for white, and he went off to law school. When he returned, a lawyer with a Georgetown degree, he started to make friends. The kind of friends who appreciated a white collar speckled with a little blood. The vampire wasn’t far behind.%0a%0aHe was looking for a servant, a cover, but Paul wore the monster down, manipulated and fought against him until the vampire Embraced him less by choice than force. Paul’s sire was young to begin with, an Ancilla too used to having mortal crutches. Once the attorney became the vampire, he made short and bloody work of his sire. Their merged blood changed fast, and altered in Paul’s image. Invigorated, alive with cannibalized and mutated Vitae, he experienced an urge unusual among young Damned. He wanted to share. So he changed his name to Adrestos, the son of the legendary King Midas, and he Embraced the first of his line, the Adrestoi.%0a%0a:Clan: Ventrue%0a%0a:Interactions with the Danse:%0aThe Children of Midas are known for results, but also for obsession. Many Ventrue look at the hunt as a disgraceful necessity, something untidy and to be kept private. The Adrestoi hunt in packs, instead, and those who have joined the Lancea Sanctum are often perceived as zealots as a consequence. Those with no such allegiance are often suspected of affliction with Malkavia or simply to have become too monstrous too fast. Where they are recognized as a bloodline, they are sometimes pitied. When encountered alone, they are often feared. Pitied or feared, Adrestoi are also well-liked. After all, they have a lot to offer. If they hunt frequently and almost openly... well, that habit is no less distasteful than the predilections of some of the other lines. Their tenacity, seemingly wired in the blood, makes them effective allies even when very young; for just as their weakness drains Vitae, it conserves their inner strength. They can turn anything to gold, given their fill of blood…%0a%0a:Nickname: Children of Midas%0a%0a:Bloodline Bane: Use of discipline aspects with No Cost or that utilize Willpower add 1 point of Vitae to their cost. %0a%0a:Bloodline Disciplines: Dominate, Animalism, Majesty, Resilience%0a%0a!!!!Bloodline Gift: Scientia est Potentia (•-•••••)%0a%0a:Description:  Scientia is a Style Merit focused on Feeding and Hunting. As such, it grants the following benefits. When joining the bloodline, gain the first dot of Scientia for free.%0a%0a•'''Taste of Blood'''- When feeding from a target, you are drinking more than just blood. For each point of vitae taken, you learn 1 aspiration, desire, or secret about your target.%0a%0a•• '''In The Blood''' - Roll Presence + Manipulation + Scientia vs Resolve + Supernatural Tolerance when feeding on someone. For each success you learn the name of someone the target shares a Connection with (IE: Blood sympathy, supernal sympathy, blood ties like family, etc)%0a%0a••• '''I Have What You Need''' -  Roll Manipulation + Persuasion + Scientia vs Composure + Supernatural Tolerance. On a success, when feeding, you learn the subject's Vice. Furthermore, choose a temporary secondary vice for the target related to the current situation (Example: Gambler, Junkie, Wrathful, etc) that lasts for the scene. If the target indulges in this vice, they gain the Leveraged Condition towards you. On an Exceptional Success, they also temporarily gain Vice-Ridden with the vice you chose until the Leveraged Condition is resolved.%0a%0a•••• '''Feed The Beast''' - Spend 1 WP when hunting a target (person or object). You gain Inspired (Target), Informed (Target) OR Prepared (Target) - Choose at the time of activating this aspect. If activated again, a new target must be chosen. \\'''Drawback''': If you frenzy at any time before finding the target, you gain the Obsessed (Target) condition for the duration of the frenzy and the frenzy does not end until one of the following condition is met: Your WP is reduced to 0, Your Vitae is reduced to 1, or your Obsession is resolved.%0a%0a••••• '''Blood Is Power''' - A good Adrestos knows that you can gain more from blood than just sustenance. When feeding from a target you may choose to do one of the following:%0a*Spend 1 WP for every point of Vitae taken in and convert that vitae into a temporary skill dot of your choosing that aligns with skills your target possesses at a 3+. %0a*Spend 2 WP for every point of Vitae taken in and convert that vitae into a temporary attribute dot of your choosing that aligns with what your target possesses at 3+. %0aThe chosen aspect affects lasts for 24 hours. \\'''Drawback''': This ability takes it strong toll on the user. You are unable to regain WP for a number of days equal to the WP spent except by fulfilling your Dirge.%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Dead Wolves''%0a%0a''You call yourselves a Pack?''%0a%0aThroughout the world, Kindred and Uratha mingle. Not every city, of course, has more than a handful of either, and even those populated by both will sometimes have their populations kept apart by fear, xenophobia, or perhaps just silent agreements. But in nearly every nation both can be found, you’ll find a few together. An Iron Master who’s taken to studying the local Kindred, both seeking out parallels with humanity and how they themselves interact with the human herd. The Mekhet who’s learned of the spirits by silently and respectfully watching from the side as an old friend’s pack performs their rites. A Bone Shadow seeking a strange form of insight by sacrificing his prey over an Acolyte’s altar. %0a%0aAnd of course, the Dead Wolf running with the Pack.%0a%0a!!!!Background%0a*“''This Story is True''. They say that before the blood reacts beneath the auspice moon, it’s as malleable as any human’s. You can be killed and risen as some zombie, permanently merged with a spirit, or even Embraced by one of our kind. Our founder, if you can call him by such a formal-sounding title, was chosen by Luna, but before his change, his blood was claimed by a Savage who’d taken on a bane forcing her into frenzy any time the full moon shone down upon her. He was just the one that was unlucky enough to be in her path when it did, but somehow, her Beast chose not to kill, but to reproduce, and she did it right in Luna’s face.”%0a*“''This Story is True''. You know of the firstborn, Urdur, those known to take on the mantle of our tribes, those children of Father Wolf that came before any others. They became the patrons of our Tribes and that of our… less wise cousins, and are spoken of in countless tales. But Father Wolf’s spirit children were not the only his essence found its way into. Some few say that he sired another, a wolf formed not of ephemera, but the essence of darkness itself, recognizable by yellow eyes among a body that’s otherwise nothing more than Shadow. It refuses patronage to those few of the People that have sought it out, but some say it’s granted a blessing to others…”%0a*“Yeah, what do they call ‘em, the fuckin’ Dead Wolves? I heard a story about ‘em. One o’ ours, some Mexican guy, I don’ know his name, they say he found his way into some spirit realm, or whatever shit the acolytes are always talkin’ about. Came across his Beast, but like, some creepy haunted version of it, and it, uh, whaddya call it, possessed him, like the damned owls do? And merged with him. But he didn’ lose control. For some reason, grabbed the attention of those lupine guys, and it all broke down from there. No, I don’t fuckin’ know if the story’s true!”  %0a%0a!!!!The Becoming%0a%0aThe Dead Wolves are most prevalent in northern Mexico, where the Uratha and Kindred have formed more substantive ties, and thus are less wary about getting close to each other, but despite what many think, the Dead Wolves don’t NEED to have ties with the Uratha. Still, allies or contacts among the Forsaken (or other Werewolves) are common, and those that already have a connection to them are most likely to be noticed and chosen by those of the bloodline, whether to become a Childe in the first place or simply to be brought closer beneath an Avus’ tutelage.%0a%0a:Requirements:%0a%0aThe Dead Wolves are Gangrel, the Savages being the only Kindred that truly understand the form the Beast takes, and thus have the unique ability to shape it to match that which dwells within the soul of the Uratha.%0a%0a:Clan: Gangrel%0a%0a:Interactions With the Danse:%0a%0aUnsurprisingly, in areas where tensions between Kindred and Uratha are high or at least far short of allegiance, but where there’s still communication, a position often forms as a sort of ambassador (when most respected) or message-carrier (when not so well thought of) between the Kindred and the local Werewolves. Dead Wolves, of course, are uniquely suited to such roles, and often serve them even if not made to do so in a formal manner. %0aBeyond that, the Circle likely harbors the highest number of them, followed, oddly enough, by the Sanctified. The Ordo Dracul and Carthians are probably next most likely, for the sake of studying their mixed condition in the former case or simply due to the ‘looser’ structure of the latter fitting them better. The Invictus very rarely take on those of this bloodline, but it’s not entirely unheard of. %0a%0a:Nickname: Wolf-Blooded (confusing as that may be among Uratha society)%0a%0a:Bloodline Bane:%0a%0aThe Dead Wolves take on a mirrored aspect of Luna’s influence, and so find themselves vulnerable to the substance that resonates most harshly with her children: silver. At Humanity 6, all Dead Wolves take on Repulsion (Silver) as a bane, though may choose a form of Detachment to stave off as normal, but it inherently counts against the limits of three banes either way.%0a%0aIn addition, those that have aligned with a Pack of Uratha find that their Beast resonates with their distant cousins’. They gain a “Trigger” for their Beast’s frenzy, similarly to a Uratha’s Kuruth trigger, but automatically aligned to The Pack. Whenever they see a member of their Pack harmed (with at least lethal damage), they must roll to resist frenzy. If the roll fails, their Beast will ALWAYS take on their Predatory Aspect, if they know that discipline, but this only applies to frenzy triggered through the Pack. %0a%0a:Bloodline Disciplines: Animalism, Protean, Resilience, ''Vigor''%0a%0a!!!!Bloodline Gift: Sublunario%0a%0aSublunario, the gift of the Dead Wolves, is a manifestation of both Luna’s influence on her Undead children, and the aspects of the Wolf they’ve taken on through their blood. This provides them with a small array of benefits that becomes more potent when the Dead Wolf is part of a Pack.%0a*All Dead Wolves have a Tell, chosen from those that the Wolf-Blooded have access to, whether they shared the blood of the Uratha in life or not. In addition, they may buy Wolf-Blooded merits if they don’t rely on any trait the Kindred doesn’t have (such as Integrity). %0a*Given their spiritual ties, Dead Wolves may purchase the Totem merit if part of a pack (whether a Pack in Werewolf terms, Gangrel terms, or both). The Totem provides the normal benefits, but cannot grant traits Vampires are normally incapable of gaining (such as certain merits) to Kindred. %0a*Dead Wolves treat their Blood Potency multiplied by two as effective Renown for calculating effective Spirit Rank, and may spend a point of Vitae to “flare” their spiritual might similar to a Uratha’s brand, treating their natural Blood Potency divided by 2 (round up) as the effective rating, for the purposes of any respect accorded. This grants Dead Wolves the “Proven“ condition. %0a%0a!!!!!Proven%0aYour character is a Proven member of the People, despite having a Kindred’s Beast instead of an inner Wolf. She’s integrated, shown her strength, and can hold her own against the more natural born hunters she stands among. Those Uratha that know of this often feel the need to see for themselves just how well she can withstand their world. Any rolls to test the character’s strength, loyalty, or right to be among the Uratha gains a +2 bonus, but doing so often simply reinforces her right to be there. %0a:Possible Sources: A Dead Wolf flaring their Blood Potency by spending Vitae.%0a:Resolution: After at least one Uratha character, or a character that’s knowingly a part of one’s pack, has taken advantage of the +2 bonus, you may shed this condition. In doing so, you may add your character’s Blood Potency divided by 2 (round up) as automatic successes to a social roll among the Uratha, or to a roll utilizing one of the skills associated with the auspice of the current moon phase. %0a%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Galloi'' %0a%0a(Per Bloodlines the Legendary pg 51)%0a%0a!!!!Background: %0a%0a:Clan: Nosferatu%0a%0a:Interactions with the Danse: (Per Bloodlines the Legendary)%0a%0a:Nickname: Pretties%0a%0a:Bloodline Bane: More so than any other vampires, the Galloi look the part of the walking corpses they are. While not under the effects of the Blush of Life, Galloi apply the same penalties they suffer when interacting with humans to all social interactions, even with Kindred and Touchstones. This includes the penalties imposed by the Nosferatu’s Lonely Curse.%0a%0a:Bloodline Disciplines: Majesty, Nightmare, Obfuscate, Vigor%0a%0a!!!!Bloodline Gift: Taurobolium%0a%0aThe Taurobolium is a sort of cleansing ritual practiced by the Galloi, where a subject is bathed in a special concoction of herbs, oils, and perfumes. The exact recipe is a secret known only to the members of the bloodline, but there is one ingredient that is very well known – blood. Any character who is bathed in this special mixture, along with at least one point of the pretty’s own Vitae, is cleansed of all blemishes, scars, and other unsightly marks; for a number of nights equal to the Galloi’s Blood Potency, the anointed character’s skin becomes as flawless as porcelain. A living subject appears younger – regardless of his actual age, he looks to be in the prime of his life for as long as the Taurobolium’s invigoration lasts. A Kindred subject retains his apparent age, but benefits from the effects of the Blush of Life for the duration instead.%0a%0aA Galloi can also learn Devotions that add other, additional effects to the Taurobolium. Each such Devotion has a Vitae cost, which must be added to the bath in addition to the point spent for the basic effects. The first Devotion, Enliven the Flesh, is free, learned automatically as a benefit of joining the Bloodline. Additional Devotions cost 2 experiences each, and have a prerequisite Discipline, which the Galloi must possess at 2 dots or higher in order to learn the Devotion.%0a%0a!!!!!Enliven the Flesh%0aThe Galloi can add one additional point of her Vitae into the bath to magnify the subject’s natural beauty, granting him one dot of Striking Looks. If the subject already had Striking Looks, this Devotion increases it to two dots. If the subject already had two dots, he gains a third dot. These Merits are not protected by the Sanctity of Merits rule, and are lost when the effects of the Tarubolium end.%0a%0a!!!!!Blessing of the Captive Eye%0aWith this Devotion, the Galloi can spend a point of Willpower when performing the Tarubolium to grant a living subject the benefits of the Lost Visage, or take those benefits away from a Kindred subject. This effect lasts for as long as the subject’s appearance is altered by the Taurobolium.%0a:Prerequisite: Obfuscate &#159;&#159;2%0a%0a!!!!!Cybele’s Terrible Beauty%0aAt the cost of an additional point of Vitae, the Galloi can grant the subject of the Taurobolium an imposing air until the Taurobolium’s effects wear off. Onlookers are intimidated by the subject’s sheer immaculacy and become flustered when interacting with him, they must make a roll of composure + supernatural tolerance - Pretty's nightmare, and upon a fail reducing their effective Composure by 2 dots for the duration of the scene.%0a:Prerequisite: Nightmare &#159;&#159;2%0a%0a!!!!!Consent of the Magna Mater%0aThe Galloi with this Devotion can add one additional point of Vitae to the Taurobolium to bless its creations with unnatural adoration. When a subject, which must be a creation of the Galloi, is viewed by another i before the Taurobolium’s effects wear off, they must make a roll of composure+supernatural tolerance - Majesty of the Galloi or take the Swooning condition towards both the subject and the Galloi that created them. %0a: Prerequisite: majesty &#159;&#159;2%0a%0a!!!!!Transgression of Attis%0aBy adding two additional Vitae into the Taurobolium, the Galloi can use this devotion to change the subject’s sex. This change is anatomically and physiologically complete, including reproductive organs, hormones, and bone structure. This change normally fades when the effects of Tarubolium wear off, but the subject can spend a point of Willpower to make the change permanent if they so desire.%0a:Prerequisite: Vigor &#159;&#159;2%0a%0a%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Duchagne'' %0a%0aDepraved even by the standards and examples set by other Kindred, the Duchagne bloodline originated in 18th century France, and those belonging to it are obsessed with sensation, decadence and other pleasures of the flesh - all fleeting, and easily discarded for fresh and new amusements when they come along. %0a%0a%0a!!!!Background: %0a%0aThe Duchagne originate in the escapades the Vicomte Albaric and Vicomtesse Eglatina du Chagne in France. When not playing hosts to debauchery, the du Chagnes toyed with the affections of naïve youths in the Court, tempting them with deviant pleasures and empty promises of power and wealth. Their lifestyle attracted a Daeva, who thought that the pair would make lovely Kindred. Indeed, the du Chagnes prospered in the Danse Macabre, learning new ways to toy with emotion and losing themselves in their won self-gratification.%0a%0aWhen the Revolution came, Albaric du Chagne and his sire were destroyed by the sun and Eglatina only barely managed to save herself by entering Torpor. When she rose again, her heart was consumed with grief over the loss of her husband. She took in several mortal retainers, hoping to use them to satisfy her debased appetites and to salve her grief. Strangely, the old methods failed to elicit any joy in her dead heart. Even more bizarrely, the loss of the Vicomte and her sire twisted her ministrations, forcing the protégées (as she preferred to call her subjects) to share her sadness and regret, feeling it as their own. Most broke under the mixture of physical and psychological torment, but a small handful flourished. No matter what she levied against their flesh and minds, these servants begged for more. Impressed, she eventually Embraced them, traning them in the ways of the Vitae as she had been trained.%0a%0aModern Duchagne find themselves ostracized by more careful Kindred. Rumors abound about just what the Bacchantes are capable of doing, and few wish to find out from personal experience. Indeed, the grand balls held by the bloodline on special occasions are often more than most care to see. These gatherings are used by members to parade their latest proteges, or to display particularly clever uses of the bloodline's ability to manipulate the senses.%0a%0a:Requirements: %0a%0a:Clan: Daeva%0a%0a:Interactions with the Danse: The bloodline's place among the various covenants and Kindred Society%0a%0a:Nickname:  Bacchantes%0a%0a:Bloodline Bane: Duchagne Kindred are prone to ennui and boredom to an extent that far surpasses that of other Kindred. They may never buy the Patient merit, and the maximum number of Extended rolls they can make for a mundane action are capped at their Humanity if it’s lower than their base dice pool. As well, they always suffer repeated action penalties for any action re-attempted in the same Night, even if not in stressful situations, due to boredom as much as frustration or mounting difficulties. %0a%0a:Bloodline Disciplines: Celerity, Majesty, Nightmare, Vigor%0a%0a!!!!Bloodline Gift: Licencieux%0a%0a:Description: To some, Licencieux is the greatest achievement of Eglatina du Chagne’s focused grief; to others, Licencieux is the stolen secret of les arts licencieux shared by the Vicomtesse’s unnamed sire. No matter where its true origins lay, Licencieux is the Duchagne’s most prized%0apossession. With it, the vampire warps the senses of her prey, manipulating others toward her own perverse goals.%0a%0aMechanically Licencieux is a series of Devotions combining the effects of Majesty and Nightmare in a way unique to the bloodline; many of them also learn more common Devotions along these lines, such as Cross-Contamination and Wet Dream. All Duchagne learn Intime for free upon joining the Bloodline. The others may be purchased in any order, and cost Experiences equal to their level.%0a%0a:Intime: %0a%0aWith an instant action, the Bacchante is able to conjure up a sort of Nostalgic aura around themselves. This causes those nearby them to experience momentary flashes of memory, good or bad (at the Duchagne’s discretion), relating to the situation at hand. This causes a sort of positive or negative association with an action or circumstance, granting the Suchagne a bonus equal to the higher of their Majesty or Nightmare (minimum 1) to Manipulation rolls on anyone affected by the aura, so long as it has something to do with correlation formed in their mind (positive or negative, they don’t need to know the exact memory inspired). Kindred (and others with an appropriate Aura) may lash out against the Duchagne when this effect is active; if they’re successful, it has no effect on them. %0aThis may not be active at the same time as Awe or Dread Presence, though the Kindred may switch between them.%0a%0a:La Touche Illusoire: %0a%0aWith this ability, the unsettling, near-terrifying illusions inspired by Dread Presence can be altered slightly. When utilizing Dread Presence, this Devotion may be activated reflexively to cause more positive, enjoyable, but still limited and fleeting illusions that may work alongside the less pleasant ones. These more enjoyable sensations may shift the effects of the Kindred’s aura slightly, removing the inability to spend Willpower against them and instead lowering their effective Composure by 1 with regards to the Duchagne’s Social rolls or Powers against them. An instant action is needed to switch between the two effects.%0aPrerequisites: Majesty 1, Nightmare 1%0a%0a:Douleur Agréable:%0a%0aBy applying waves of pleasure or pain onto a subject, the Bacchante is able to more fully sculpt their behavior and personality, correlating pain with those things they discourage and pleasure with those they want the subject to partake in more often. Roll Intelligence + Empathy + (Lower of Majesty and Nightmare) as an instant action vs the subject’s Composure + Blood Potency. If the Duchagne wins, they inflict the Insensate Tilt for a turn, representing extreme pain or pleasure, and then the Swooning or Scarred condition, for pleasure or pain respectively. On an exceptional success, inflict Wanton or Bestial too, even if the target’s already had it within the last month. Repeated (successful) uses of this on the same sort of action for the same subject (more than the target’s Composure in a Story) can cause the Phobia or Obsession condition relating to the action or circumstance, as appropriate.%0aPrerequisites: Majesty 2, Nightmare 2%0a%0a%0a*New Condition: Phobia (Persistent)%0a%0aYou’ve grown a deep seated fear or someone or something, and find it difficult to remain in its presence, or otherwise confront it. When forced to do so, roll Resolve + Composure; on a failure, you suffer the effects of the Frightened condition relating to your Phobia.%0a%0aResolution: Spend time and effort working to overcome your fear. Gain a dot of Integrity, or lose one due to this Phobia.%0a%0aBeat: Per Frightened’s Resolution.%0a%0a:Insensate:%0a%0aBy removing sensation instead of stimulating it, the Kindred can gain far more direct control over a subject, torture them, or simply cripple them entirely. Spend 1 Vitae and roll Manipulation + Subterfuge + Nightmare vs the target’s Resolve + Blood Potency, as an instant action. If the opponent’s roll is beaten, they lose a sense chosen by the Kindred for the scene, applying the appropriate Tilt if applicable (Blind, Deaf, etc).  %0aPrerequisites: Majesty 3, Nightmare 3%0a%0a:Jardin d’Agrément:%0a%0aThe emotional intensity of Majesty is allowed to seep into the illusionary projections of Nightmare to create a fully realized fiction or narrative to a targeted subject. Spend an additional Vitae and a Willpower when activating Mortal Terror to utilize this Devotion; if successful, the victim (or victims) will find the illusion alters and shifts to fit an emotion defined by the Duchagne. They take a mundane condition related to the emotion (which can include the competitive, wanton, and bestial conditions, even if already experienced this month), and for so long as they’re under the effects of the illusion, they take a penalty equal to the higher of the Bacchante’s Majesty or Nightmare rating to any actions the emotion would inhibit or run counter to. If desired, the emotion can be made rather specific; hatred of a specific person, for instance, but then the penalty becomes similarly narrowed.%0aPrerequisites: Majesty 4, Nightmare 4%0a%0a%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Anvari'' %0a%0aLike their Daeva parents, the Anvari are very sensual in nature, but unlike the Succubi, they do not compensate for%0atheir lost passions by manipulating others.  Rather, the Anvari have turned to the use of opium and other narcotics to try to recapture their dead emotions. Over the centuries, the Anvari have come to view narcotics not only as a way to ease the torments of unlife, but as a way to ascend to a higher state.  The bloodline also relies on the addictive effects of narcotics to tie others to its members. Building herds of pliant kine is not only acceptable to the Anvari, but%0anecessary. %0a%0a!!!!Background: %0a%0aThe Anvari claim to be one of the oldest bloodlines walking tonight.  According to their legends, their founder was Sepehr Anvari, an opium-dealer in the last years of the Persian Empire. %0a%0a:Requirements: What does it take to get into this bloodline?%0a%0a:Clan:  Daeva%0a%0a:Interactions with the Danse: Other Kindred tend to view the Anvari with distaste at best, and as a constant threat to exposure among mortals at worst. The rest of the Daeva view Pushers as substandard members of the clan who are%0aincapable of seducing prey through beauty and talent alone. More Anvari are drawn to the Circle of the Crone than any other covenant.  The myths of Sumeria and Persia both have a strong female presence, leading many of the bloodline —particularly its elders — to be comfortable with the Acolytes’ general philosophy.  Furthermore, as some rituals of the old ways employ psychotropic substances, the Anvari are able to barter influence readily among the cultists. The Carthians are probably the most common choice for young Anvari, if for no other reason than members are slightly less hidebound in their viewpoints than more staid covenants. The Invictus enjoys its share of Pushers as well, whether they are established elders with a secure power base or up-and-coming dealers building fortunes in the drug trade. The Ordo Draculmay interest the occasional Anvari who seeks to escape the Curse or addiction through covenant strictures,but by and large its rites and practices require more self-discipline than most Pushers are willing to devote. It is the rare Anvari indeed who heeds the call of the Lancea Sanctum, as the very nature of the%0abloodline’s relationship with narcotics is offensive to many orthodox followers of that group.%0a%0a:Nickname: Pushers%0a%0a:Bloodline Bane: Anvari have become reliant upon the narcotics that they’re so closely tied to. When feeding upon mortals that have no opiates or opium-derived drugs in their system, they must spend a point of willpower, as if feeding from blood unsuitable for their blood potency rating. This does stack with that requirement, in the case of an elder, however, requiring two points of willpower to be spent (this breaks the normal rule allowing only one willpower per action). In addition, they are susceptible to becoming addicted to those same substances when ingested through the blood of those individuals, using the normal system for addiction. %0a%0a:Bloodline Disciplines: Auspex, Celerity, Majesty, Resilience%0a%0a!!!!Bloodline Gift: Nepenthe%0a%0a:Description: Nepenthe is the capability of the Anvari to sense, control, and emulate the effects of narcotics, especially opiates. Their bloodline gift is what has helped them to garner the nickname of Pushers, and helps them both feed and manipulate their herd. %0aThe gift is represented by a series of Devotions, though all Anvari start off with Fragrance of Hal’gil as an innate capability. %0a%0a*Fragrance of Hal’gil: The Anvari becomes able to sense the presence of narcotics, both in raw form and within the blood of living beings, the same way they’re able to sense blood, using their Kindred Senses, with the extent dependent on Blood Potency as normal. They might be able to smell opium-laden blood (and can tell the difference between it and ‘clean’ blood), or hear the languid heartbeat of someone under the influence of narcotics. They can tell the difference between opiates and other narcotics, as well as between pure drugs, cut drugs, and outright fakes by sight, even if it would be just about impossible to tell normally without using it.%0a%0aInflict the Empty Soul (Majesty ••, Resilience •): With an instant action and one Vitae, the Kindred may roll Manipulation + Medicine + Majesty, versus the target’s Stamina + Blood Potency (if unwilling). If they gain the most successes (or at least one if uncontested), they can remove the effects of any narcotic from a target, which can include themself, although this does nothing to alleviate addiction, and in fact repeated usage may cause the Deprived condition in someone with the Addicted condition relating to narcotics. However, this can be a good way to punish an addict or to regain one’s senses in an emergency.%0a%0aThis devotion costs 2 Experiences to learn.%0a%0a*Crave the Caress (Majesty •••): The Kindred creates an incredible urge for a chosen drug in a target, by spending 1 Vitae and rolling Manipulation + Persuasion + Majesty versus the target’s Composure + Blood Potency. If the Anvari rolls more successes, the target gains the Addicted and Deprived condition with regards to the drug, which will resolve naturally when the night ends. Providing the drug allows the Kindred to force a door during social maneuvering, counting as hard leverage that forced a breaking point (even if it didn’t), but not requiring any roll. %0a%0aThis devotion costs 2 Experiences to learn.%0a%0a*Blessed Kiss of Hal’gil (Majesty •••• or Auspex ••••, Resilience ••): This devotion allows the Anvari to create the sensation of taking a narcotic within a subject, dulling pain, relaxing them, and perhaps worsening addictions. The Kindred spends 1 Vitae and rolls Presence + Medicine + Majesty or Auspex against the target’s Stamina + Blood Potency. If they roll more successes, the subject is affected as if by a narcotic with a potency/toxicity equal to the Kindred’s dots in Majesty or Auspex (whichever is higher). The Kindred decides if it works normally or as if through an overdose. In the former case, all wound penalties are removed for the next scene,  although they also take a -3 penalty to all physical dice pools for the same amount of time, and continued use of this devotion may cause the Addiction condition in a target. However, it will also end the Deprived condition with regards to narcotics. If treated as an overdose, the target rolls to avoid damage immediately, and then once per hour for a number of hours equal to six minus their stamina. %0a%0aThis devotion costs 3 Experiences to learn.%0a%0a%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Morotrophians'' %0a%0aAccording to your chart here, you’re due to be released tomorrow night. But we can’t have that, now, when there’s still so much work to do, can we? Just hold still, we’ll make sure they correct this error...  %0a%0aNot every scream in the ICU is caused by a painful disease wreaking havoc with a patient’s senses. Not every cry in the prison is an inmate demanding to be released or being unwilling to make peace with their situation. Not every wail in the orphanage is a young child simply wishing their parents were still around. Many times, in the darkest moments of the night, these calls are caused not by the situation of those dwelling inside, but by the monsters lurking in the institution’s shadows, the nightmares made manifest of those within. The Morotrophians. %0aThey are the doctor known to perform just a few too many surgeries, the bogeyman in the dark corners of the unkempt orphanage, and the brutal guard in the prison. Wherever there’s a group of people that nobody will pay attention to when claims of monsters amongst the staff or in the corners are made, it’s likely that one of the Monks has made their home there. %0a%0a%0a!!!!Background: %0a%0aWhile the first Monk’s sire is unknown, he himself has been recorded, his modern progeny usually knowing much about him, given the bloodline’s aptitude for record keeping and procedure. His name was Ludoldus, a young german monk that found himself unable to leave the confines of his monastery after being embraced as a Nosferatu, suffering bouts of fear and confusion whenever he left the property. %0aLonely an existence as that was, it wasn’t too long before he began to sire progeny of his own, using his connections from life to find them homes amongst other monasteries and abbeys when it became clear they couldn’t possibly all stay in the same place without drawing attention. Of course, this cycle quickly repeated, each one a little further away from the standard Ludoldus himself kept with regards to who he would feed on or experiment upon. What followed was a great purging of sorts, some say by God himself, while others claim it was simply a matter of overpopulation and recklessness, as the monks and nuns discovered what was responsible for the sudden deaths. Either way, nearly half the bloodline was killed, and it was in the aftermath that they began to settle in positions where those within wouldn’t be listened to by man or God alike; asylums. %0aIt’s had its ups and downs since then, but in modern times the bloodline can be found (in more conservative numbers) throughout civilized societies around the world. For more information on their history, see Bloodlines: The Hidden.%0a%0a%0a:Requirements:  Morotrophians need to be Nosferatu, and in general must also be free of any persistent mental conditions of their own before their bloodline can properly be activated.%0a%0a:Clan: Nosferatu%0a%0a:Interactions with the Danse: The Morotrophians have no official organization amongst themselves, since so few of them are ever in the same area, and especially not the same building (which few ever wish to leave). They do tend to have reliable lines of communication to others of their kind, however, the better to manipulate the setup of institutions that go up further than the local asylum; using each others’ connections as a group to manipulate the State Department, for instance.%0a%0aWhether amongst their own kind or amongst Kindred in general, the Monks tend to keep extensive record of debts owed, favors paid, and assistance rendered both by and for others, and are well known for causing trouble for those that welch on a debt. While they rarely leave their homes to do this themselves, other Monks or Kindred that refuse to repay their favors may find themselves hassled by government agencies or news crews that pay a little too much scrutiny to the offending Kindred, often causing no end of problems for them, even occasionally driving them out of their previously safe haven. %0a%0aWith regards to wider Kindred society, those that align themselves with a covenant often find themselves amongst the Invictus, their tendency for rules, order, oaths, and debt tracking innately suiting their talents. Some others that still haunt religious organizations or cults find that the Lancea et Sanctum calls to them, allowing them to play the monster in the dark that punishes the sinful and tests the righteous. Finally, some few join the Ordo Dracul, taking command of an institution that also happens to be a Wyrm’s Nest, often being willing to watch over even those said to be the most dangerous.%0a%0aThough they may deal with their covenant, very few take positions of power amongst Kindred as a whole, rarely participating in the politics of other vampires unless the rulings involved would affect their own institution. In such a case, they’ll often suddenly call upon the large number of small favors many of them have collected, working to be sure their hunting grounds go unharmed. The one exception to this is the occasional Keeper of Elysium; none can run a proper court quite like one of the Monks.%0a%0a%0a:Nickname: Monks%0a%0a:Bloodline Bane: The mind of a Morotrophian works best when steeped in procedures, rules, guidelines, and boundaries, whether physical, social, or simply well known and understood. In fact, when outside of an institution (see Institutionalize, below) or another situation that meets these prerequisites, their mind has trouble working at all; they suffer the Confused condition until they’ve spent at least a half hour clearing their mind in an appropriate institution (and gain no beat for its resolution). Usually, this bane only applies if some sort of social or mental task needs to be accomplished there; simply walking down the street won’t cause them any particular problem.%0a%0a%0a:Bloodline Disciplines: Nightmare, Obfuscate, Vigor, Dominate%0a%0a!!!!Bloodline Gift: Institutionalize, Authority, and Operation%0a%0a:Description: Despite being stuck within his monastery, Ludoldus found he was able to form a greater connection to it than has ever been seen before amongst Kindred, finding that the secrets of the building itself and those of the people within it seemed to be almost intuitively understood by him. This bloodline gift of the Morotrophians, now called Institutionalize, allows both understanding and control of an institution or similar location. Rules can be made to be followed, the motivations of those supposedly in charge can be understood, and the building seems to just run smoother for the Monk. %0a%0aThere are conditions with regards to what sorts of institutions, buildings, and gathering places can be affected by their Gift. Generally, most of the following conditions must be met:%0a*It must be a geographical location with easily discernable or at least commonly known boundaries, and must have mandatory attendance of some kind, whether for members of a cult, a prison’s population, or a hospital simply requiring that patients stay for observation and that schedules its staff.%0a*It must contain some sort of social group or organization that has rules for the ways certain individuals are meant to behave, which can include everything from an orphanage having a curfew for the children, to the Laws of Elysium applying to Kindred within, to the separation between employees and guests at an office. %0a*Some group within must usually concede some form of control over their life or legal rights. This can include mental patients having no control over their daily schedule and treatment, to developers for a company signing their copyright claims away.%0a%0aIn addition, most buildings that are represented by a merit (Safe Place, for instance, and especially Havens) or that are part of a supernatural society (even if it doesn’t quite follow the rules above) can also be affected by this Gift. %0aWhen working with such a location, the Monk then gains a number of capabilities, described as Aspects of their gift. The Aspects are Examination, Authority, and Operation, which are each merits rated at one to five dots. Morotrophians start with one dot in each, and may purchase further dots of the Aspect merits as normal.%0aThe Kindred’s level of any Aspect  always controls either the number of individuals affected or the size of the location influenced, in addition to what’s listed under the effects of each Aspect.%0a%0a•: A single individual, very small room (a closet, for instance), or similar sized space.%0a%0a••: A few (up to 5) related individuals of the same type (All are guards, all are inmates, all are patients, etc), or a single regular sized room (A patient’s room would apply, for instance, but not a cafeteria).%0a%0a•••: A small group (up to 20 people) of related individuals of the same type , a few (up to 5) unrelated individuals in the same area (a guard and the two inmates nearby), a larger room (a waiting room, for instance), or a few related rooms (up to 5 prison cells, for instance).%0a%0a••••: A much larger group of related individuals (up to 50 targets of the same type), a small group of unrelated individuals (up to 20 people of any sort that match the Gift’s criteria), a very large room or similar sized location (an ICU, a playground), or a large number of related rooms (all bunks on the first floor).  %0a%0a••••• The entirety of a building and the grounds surrounding it, or all of the people within the area.%0a%0aUnless otherwise stated, any Aspect use that isn’t instantaneous lasts for a scene. %0a%0aCost: All Aspects cost one Vitae per dot level used, although the first time each one is used in a scene, this is lowered by one, to a minimum of zero.%0a%0a*Examination%0a%0aUsing the Examine Aspect of Institutionalize reveals secrets about both mortal and location alike, the exact information revealed listed below. The roll to discern this information is Wits + Examination + Blood Potency - group/location size (per rating, above), with an additional penalty equal to the highest Composure amongst the targets in the case of a group. In the case of a Clash of Wills being needed, Wits + Blood Potency is rolled.%0a%0a•: The Morotorphian can discern the social dynamics of a group observed, gaining the ability to ask one question about that interplay per success rolled. Alternatively, he may ask one piece of information per success rolled about the location studied itself. In both cases, this must be purely mundane information, and only covers the specific emotions or physical facts themselves, not the reasons behind it. %0aExample: The Monk’s player might study a group of prisoners sitting together, and ask who is seen as the most dangerous amongst them. He’d learn who it was, but not WHY he’s considered the most dangerous. Alternatively, he might ask which piece of machinery in a room breaks down the most often, but he would have no idea what causes it to fail.%0a%0a••: The monk becomes able to dig a little deeper. He can learn reasons behind mundane questions asked, in general terms. These do count as additional ‘questions’, however, so further successes must be spent or the power used again. Alternatively, he can now learn supernaturally-oriented information; someone acting a certain way because of a use of Majesty, for instance, or a location acting as a Shadow Gate when certain conditions are  met. These still require the proper questions, of course.%0aExample: In the above example, a success might be used to learn that the most dangerous of the inmates is viewed that way because he spent several months in solitary after breaking a guy’s arm. Or he may learn that the machinery breaks down because the janitor keeps sabotaging it out of anger against those in charge.   %0a%0a•••: At this level, the Morotrophian becomes better able to make sense of the supernatural information as well, learning the implications behind it, and perhaps even a bit about supernatural society, if related to the institution it’s being used at. Similarly, locations give up why their supernatural aspects exist as they do, such as who or what caused them. As above, this requires additional successes.%0aExample: A success is spent to learn that the cute nurse is actually a Werewolf, while another tells him that a small group of others respect her because of this. Another success could be then spent to learn she’s a leader of the pack, and further questioning might reveal she’s a Cahalith, which is fairly typical for an alpha.%0a%0a••••: The vampire moves beyond asking questions and becomes able to project his senses. If targeting individuals, the Kindred becomes able to share the senses of any individual within the targeted group, though can only do so to one at a time. If targeting an area, he can project his senses anywhere within it, as if viewing from behind a glass wall. At this level, this ability does not allow for a Clash of Wills; the perception is purely mundane (unless a targeted individual has a power that reveals supernatural information in use).%0a%0a•••••: As with the previous rating, the senses of a group or view of a location can be provided, but it’s more far reaching. The Kindred may simultaneously perceive from and understand the sensory input of a number of individuals or spots within the location equal to his Blood Potency. In addition, this perception allows him to see through illusions and similar trickery, allowing a Clash of Wills versus any power that alters perception or conceals something perceptible.%0a%0a%0a*Authority%0a%0aThe Aspect of Authority is what gives the Morotrophians their reputation for being able to run a well oiled machine, or at least, it certainly helps them to reinforce that viewpoint. Authority is used to make sure rules and procedure are followed. To utilize Authority, Manipulation + Authority + Blood Potency - size is rolled. Individuals may contest this with Resolve + Blood Potency. Any Clash of Wills resulting uses Manipulation + Blood Potency.%0a%0a•: At the basic level, a Morotrophian can stop targeted people from doing one specific, named thing that’s against the listed, established rules, though he cannot then make him do the correct thing in turn. For instance, he could stop an orphan from running away, but could not make the child then go to their room and fall asleep despite it being lights out, if he’s already outside. It also cannot cause inaction that would lead to harm coming to the target, however minor. When targeting a location, this makes sure it continues to run properly for the scene; machines won’t break down, locked doors won’t fail, and the power will remain constant. Any attempt to make it do otherwise suffers a penalty equal to the successes rolled, if mundane, and causes a Clash of Wills if supernatural. %0a%0a••: More advanced levels of Authority allow the Morotrophian to make a given individual or group do as the rules say they should. A nurse that’s avoiding treating a patient she dislikes, for instance, might be forced to do her rounds and treat them as normal. In the case of a location, it not only keeps things running properly, but can make sure that proper procedures and rules, including who can access it, are followed by anyone that might interact with it, rather than needing to target those people individually. Someone attempting to do something against that area’s rules or go somewhere in the area that they’re not supposed to must roll Resolve + Blood Potency as if they themselves were targeted, and beat the successes rolled by the Morotrophian. In both cases, these must still follow already established rules and guidelines.%0a%0a•••: The Morotrophian learns to work within the spirit of the rules, or rather, the rules as he interprets them. He may do anything the first or second level allows, but may work within the spirit of the rules, even if the letter of the existing procedures does not prevent what’s being done. It’s ultimately a Storyteller call what does or does not follow the spirit of the institution’s guidelines.%0a%0a••••: At this level, the Morotrophian not only interprets the rules, but creates them. He may use the first or second level of this Aspect with regards to a new rule created by him, by first writing it or otherwise placing it somewhere where it’d be seen or heard by those that should follow it. This includes anything from a “Do not enter” sign on a location he doesn’t want disturbed, to scrawling something on a sign that lists the rules for a swimming pool, or even making an announcement about it before activating the power. %0a%0a•••••: The ultimate extension of the Monk’s Authority comes when he not only can create new rules and make sure they’re followed, but when he can seem to retroactively put them in place. By using this level, the Monk creates a rule, as above, but in addition to it appearing where he puts it, circumstances come together to make sure the rule is actually entered into the books, or wherever such rules are usually kept. Any individuals in the area act as if this is entirely normal, though powers that discern memory alteration or mind affecting abilities can detect this, and potentially undo it with a Clash of Wills as normal. %0a%0a*Operation%0a%0aWhile Authority works to make sure rules and procedures are followed, Operation is used to more directly control the day to day operation of the location, or even to take control of the area itself. Stamina + Operation + Blood Potency - size is rolled to active it, contested by Composure + Blood Potency if appropriate. A Clash of Wills, if needed, uses Stamina + Blood Potency. In any case where a dice pool might be needed to perform an action reliably when controlling a location’s operation, use the Kindred’s Intelligence + Wits as their base dice pool.%0a%0a•: At this level, a brief moment of control over the location is taken, to perform one simple physical task the location or area is built for. For instance, the lights could be flicked off or on, a machine could be activated, or an alarm tripped despite nobody being present. Individuals targeted can have an idea put in their mind as to something that needs to be done (for instance, “That IV needs to be changed”), but it isn’t enforced.%0a%0a••: More complex operation of a single aspect of an area can be controlled. With concentration (roll Resolve + Composure if he tries to do anything else, or gets distracted, or the effect ends), the Kindred could control what a camera sees, masking the reality of it, for instance, or could cause an industrial assembly line to activate and go through the whole process of manufacturing an object. Individuals targeted feel an urge to perform a task placed in their mind (that relates to the operation of the institution), and will do so as soon as they reasonably can if they fail to resist. In either case, this can last up to five minutes per success rolled.%0a%0a•••: Continuous control, that lasts an entire scene (or a half hour per success, if specific times are needed), can be provided at this level, which works identically to the second, but allows for the longer timespan. He must still concentrate on what he’s doing at this point.%0a%0a••••: With the fourth level, the Morotrophian becomes able to more reflexively control the institution. He may perform any actions that the second (and third) level of Operation allows for without needing continual concentration, allowing him to take other actions or be distracted without interrupting what he’s doing.%0a%0a•••••: The Kindred gains the ability to go into a trance, at this level, to more directly take control of an area, as if an extension of himself. His body goes into a state similar to Torpor for the duration, and he gains control of every physical aspect of the location targeted, able to do anything from opening and closing a door as easily as he could move his hand, to speaking through the loudspeakers as easily as he could talk normally. His senses are limited to what might normally be within the building, such as seeing through cameras or listening through microphones, unless he also uses Examine’s fourth or fifth dot after activating this Aspect. At any point, he may return to his body at will, ending the Aspect and waking up, but he has no sense of his own body otherwise unless he takes damage. When targeting individuals with this level, it works the same as the fourth, but he may continually change the task to be completed whenever it gets completed, for the duration.%0a%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Name of Bloodline here'' %0a%0aFill out the introduction with what the bloodline is about and their goals and driving force.

At the end of the night there just wasn’t any doubt of the outcome.''%0a%0aThe lodge itself is not very big and it doesn’t help that the Uratha are divided amongst themselves when it comes to the embassy and the accords, nevertheless this lodge was born out of a desire to promote and secure the position of the Uratha of the tribes of the moon as a faction on the embassy of Portland, though less known too it’s that they also are on the lookout of the possibility of another war being waged and work both to ensure that it doesn’t happen or failing that, that the Uratha come on top of it. One of the things that they focus though is understanding the others supernatural denizens of the city and also networking with the different factions, “keep your friends close and your enemies closer” rings truth and chiefly among them, though who they consider friends and enemies is not something they openly discuss, they do lend themselves to hunting down threats to the embassy when asked or sometimes even when not, giving them a reputation of helpful hunters at best and meddlers at worst.%0a%0aThey draw members from any tribe so long as they aligns themselves with embassy accords, they have a preference on Elodoths and Irraka over the other auspices, drawing on the ease these two auspices have when talking with others for either securing cooperation or drawing secrets out of them. %0a%0aOn the hunt they are not that different from any other werewolves, they do bring however a considerable network of contacts and allies into play when the hunt takes them away from their own territory and are forced through unfamiliar territory, they have a better time avoiding stepping on toes when it does happen and thanks to keeping good or just cordial relationships with the others can in a limited fashion piggy ride on the work the others have done on their territory for their advantage provided they don’t abuse the privilege.%0a%0aTo that end, their given word is specially binding to them, what they agree to they will make sure to fulfill to the best of their abilities, following both the letter and the spirit of the contract they bind themselves to, the accords being one such contract it holds a great deal of importance to them, on the other hand because of this oath breakers are hold on special contempt by lodge members and weaseling out of a deal it’s grounds for a formal challenge or demands of reparation and they have a surprisingly easy time spotting when someone is doing just that or just lying to their face.%0a%0a:Requirements: Must be Pro-Embassy/Accords%0a%0a!!!!Totem: The Witness of the Pact%0a%0aThe Witness of the Pact is a spirit born when the Uratha banded together and the war started to take its toll on the werewolves packs on the city, it pledged its support then because the wolves needed a unifying force and it grew on strength while they remained united, though because of its ban it eventually grew weary of them when they gave their word to the Lost and chose to break it when failing to fulfill their end of the bargain.%0a%0aThe spirit however has not forgotten where it came from and stills wishes to honor the alliance it had with the Uratha of the city, with the signing of the accords it forces its lodge members to abide by them but also be on guard when it comes to traitors and oath breakers lets it’s them that end up paying the price, it preaches honesty but not to the point of stupidity, it acknowledges the need for secrecy as well.%0a%0aNowadays it has grown with the influence of the embassy and the essence it distills from the peacekeeping done among the factions and while it has ties to the embassy it’s primarily bound and contracted with the werewolves.%0a%0a!!!!Lodge Bonds %0a:Blessing: The lodge members enjoy the condition Connected (Embassy/Accords) and once per month you can spend a willpower point to get it back if they have burned it or otherwise resolved it, it also allows them to buy pack tactics that take others into account and use them at the cost of +&#9679; if they are packmates (storytellers at the final arbiters of what applies to non-werewolf members when it comes to pack tactics) non packmates don't count even if they have been added with facets like Lead the Lesser Pack. It’s still required that they practice and train on the use of the tactics for at least a month to master them but at the end it allows the Uratha to subtly read the cues of his non werewolf allies and react accordingly to whatever tactic they are trying to pull off.%0a:Aspiration: Promoting and securing the Uratha position in the Embassy%0a:Ban: Never willing break your given oaths.\\%0aCasually given word won’t trigger the ban, but a formal promise will, the important thing is the intent behind the promise, and as the ban says the character must do everything in its power to keep his word, however if happenstance or just bad luck is what forces an oath to be broken it doesn’t trigger the ban.%0a%0a:The Sacred Hunt: On the sacred hunt they can chose to benefit from any territorial merits, rite or gifts they have so long as they are hunting on an Embassy managed territory, it doesn’t apply when hunting on territory that no one manages or that are either neutral or against the embassy and disrespecting others territory can count as a breaking point towards spirit while being a guest.%0a%0a!!!!Tools%0a%0aMembers of the lodge can make use of the Lodge Armory, Lodge Lorehouse and Lodge Connections merit when it comes to the network of the Embassy faction.%0a %0a:Five Talons of the Claw (Fetish &#9679;&#9679;&#9679;):%0aThe fetish is made of five claws that are handed over to the beneficiaries of it.\\%0aEffect: As per the facet Lead the Lesser Pack (WtF.

They tend to be more apt to ritually cast, using sigils and circles that can take some time to prepare. Ritual Circle (+2): Whether salt, sulfer or chalk, a circle denotes the eternal continuation of cycles, the old becoming the new, and vice versa. Any power using a ritual circle ends if the circle is broken, or the caster steps outside of it.%0a:Oblations: Prayer to spirits or other beings, ceremonies meant to celebrate old traditions. Generally speaking done with either a roll of Wits+Occult, or Presence+Occult, depending on the styling of the ritual. Telling inspiring stories of the old ways: Presence+Expression/occult%0a%0a!!!!Attainments%0a%0a!!!!!First Attainment: Understanding the Katsina%0a:Prerequisite: Initiation\\%0aThe Caretaker’s frst and most important revelation is the nature of her spirit guide; an incarnation of the Primal Wild whose nature most powerfully resonates with the mage’s own. This “spirit” (which is an archetypal ideal, rather than an individual entity) is an animal, elemental manifestation, plant, or something of the sort: coyotes, bears, ravens, mountains, streams, storms, cacti, or cedar trees, for example. When seen in Shadow, the mage possesses features reminiscent of the spirit guide. The player and Storyteller should work together to determine an appropriate spirit guide for the Caretaker.\\%0aWhen activating this attainment, the Mage becomes able to see, hear, and speak with spirits for a couple turns at a time (per transitory duration), though this may be continually re-activated during a conversation to allow for 'uninterrupted' perception.%0a%0a%0a!!!!!Second Attainment: Veil of the Katsina%0a:Prerequisite: Spirit 2\\%0aAs connections grow between the Caretaker and their Guide, they begin to realize how to protect themselves from spiritual predation. They internalize the Ephemeral Shield spell, allowing them to activate it with a short ritual to gain its protection for the day.%0a%0a!!!!!Third Attainment: Calling the Katsina%0a:Prerequisite: Spirit 3\\%0aThe Caretaker grows closer to oneness with her spirit guide, embracing its metaphysical qualities. The mage’s Primal connection grants her an Influence (as per spirit In&#64258;uences, on pp. 258-259 of Mage: The Awakening and Werewolf: The Forsaken page 187) with a descriptor identical to the nature of her guide, at a rating equal to half her Gnosis, rounding down. (In other words, a Gnosis 4 willworker who identifes with the wolf gains an In&#64258;uence of Wolves at two dots, while one with a Gnosis 8 whose spirit guide embodies rain gains an In&#64258;uence of Rain at four dots.) The mage rolls Gnosis + Spirit to use this In&#64258;uence and spends points of Mana in place of Essence, on a one-for-one basis. %0a%0a!!!!!Fourth Attainment: Becoming the Katsina%0a:Prerequisite: Spirit 4\\%0aWith this Attainment, the Caretaker acquires the ability to temporarily physically incarnate certain of the qualities of his spirit guide, calling its ideal down from the Primal Wild and into himself, and becoming something halfway between spirit and &#64258;esh. By activating this attainment, the character becomes able to cross the Gauntlet as if with the spell Reaching with the Reach spent, forming an Iris that lasts for about a turn. They may also activate it without the Reach to become able to interact physically with the other side of the Gauntlet for up to a month at a time.%0a%0a:Optional Arcana: Life 4\\%0aAs an instant action, the Mage may take on effects appropriate to their spirit guide, akin to the Transform Life spell, with a number of features gained equal to the Mage's Life Arcanum. This lasts for up to a day at a time. As well, the Mage may gain access to these features automatically (for the same duration) upon activating the base attainment to interact with the other side of the Gauntlet (as that closeness draws their spirit guide in more easily).%0a%0a!!!!!Fifth Attainment: Purity of Destruction%0a:Prerequisite: Spirit 5\\%0aAt this level of understanding, the Caretaker understands that even those who try to meld the old with the new, must sometimes cut out a cancer before it has time to spread. Those that advance to this highest of levels are able to Annihilate Spirits at will, though they tend to use this power sparingly... This power is used more often after every other option has been exhausted, and tends to even then, only be used sparingly, as spirits tend to shy away from those with the power to end their very existence completely. This will affect any spirit up to Rank 5, and the Mage gains a number of successes on the ensuing Clash of Wills equal to their Spirit rating.%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Lords of the Inanimate''%0a%0aThe practitioners of this Legacy understand everything in the Fallen World has a voice, if%0aonly one knows how to listen well enough. Moreover, they can do more than listen to the%0avoices of the objects around them, they can also command the objects to do their bidding.%0aTheir ability to command the inanimate world comes with a far deeper understanding of and%0asympathy for the objects and devices around them. Once they have the ability to do so, most%0aLords of the Inanimate permanently awaken the spirits of the objects and devices they used%0amost often. As a result, many have spiritually awakened houses, cars, computers, and%0aoccasionally cell phones or handguns.%0a%0a!!!!Origins%0a%0a:Parentage: Thyrsus, Silver Ladder%0a%0a:Background: Many Animists work with their hands, building or repairing objects. Those%0awho don’t are usually part of some profession that involves interacting with objects in a%0aprecise and careful fashion. Members include everything from individuals who authenticate%0aor restore valuable antiques to archaeologists and even chefs. Members of this Legacy%0acome from all social classes and professions but are united by the attention they pay to the%0aobjects and devices they use as part of their daily lives. They also tend to be highly physical%0aand even sensual individuals who enjoy physically experiencing the world around them.%0aMembers who do not work with their hands extensively in their chosen professions almost%0aalways enjoy hobbies where they do so.%0a%0a:Appearance: Animists pay close attention to all the goods they regularly use. Regardless of%0awhether they prefer rugged outdoor clothing or expensive and fancy suits, all their clothes%0aare well-made and maintained. Few Animists would consider purchasing shoddy or ill-made%0agoods or goods that will wear out quickly. They prefer to have time to develop a close%0arelationship with their possessions. Animists are also unusually careful in the way they use%0aobjects and avoid slamming doors or otherwise harshly using objects unless it is necessary.%0aIn stories about Animists Told by other mages, the followers of this Legacy regularly talk to%0athe objects and devices they use, and some mages watch Animists closely to see whether%0athey are actually whispering or listening to their wristwatches or pocketknives. In reality, only%0aa few of the most eccentric Animists talk to objects when not in private or using the%0aAttainments of their Legacy. Instead, to avoid being seen as deeply eccentric and potentially%0aeven unbalanced, the vast majority of Animists are far more discrete. However, most touch%0aand sometimes even caress the objects they use; often rewarding a well-functioning object%0ain much the same manner a dog owner would pet a dog that performed a trick particularly%0awell.\\%0aMany Animists are exceedingly knowledgeable about the various sorts of objects and%0adevices they regularly use and can go on at great length about the relative merits of different%0acell phones, cars, computers or different brands of tools. However, most are also at least%0amoderately socially adept and understand at least the basics of how not to bore or annoy%0athose to whom they are talking.%0a%0a!!!!Doctrine%0a%0a:Prerequisites: Matter 2, Persuasion 2, Crafts 1%0a%0a:Initiation: The applicant must present at a Conclave (see below) an object of excellent%0aquality that they have crafted themselves by ‘hand’ - meaning that mundane tools are%0aallowed but using magic to shape them is not. The creation is judged by a panel of Lords,%0awho also take the opinion of the object’s spirit into consideration.%0a:Organization: Some Animists get along better with the spirits of their favorite objects than%0awith other humans, including other mages, and many have little time for formal ceremonies%0aor bureaucracy. As a result, Animists have a fairly loose organization, where members keep%0ain touch on a moderately informal basis. In the past decade, this trend has been further%0aexacerbated by the fact that an increasing number of Animists are rousing the spirits of their%0acell phones and answering machines and having them screen calls and deal with most%0acallers like an especially skilled 24-hour secretary.\\%0aIn most cases, Animists are connected to one another by ties of personal friendship, with%0athose who are well liked or respected by their fellows having far more contact with other%0amembers of this Legacy. The only exception to this loose and informal contact is during the%0aLegacy’s yearly Conclave. Held in a different city each year, this Conclave is a chance for%0amembers to meet, for individuals who wish to become members to attempt to convince an%0aAnimist to teach them, and for the various Animists to show off the various spirits with which%0athey are working.\\%0aWith an atmosphere somewhere between an academic conference, a high-end craft fair and%0aa dog show, Conclaves are chaotic events wherein members report about interesting or%0aunusual applications of their abilities. The most chaotic and prestigious part of the Conclave%0aconsists of the more experienced members showing off objects whose spirits they have%0aawakened. In addition, Animists also discuss and demonstrate ways they have found to be%0aable to work in tandem with their spirits. As noted, the Conclave is also where prospective%0amembers can attempt to convince an Animist to teach them. This in-person contact is%0acrucial, because many Animists decide whether those prospective members are worthy to%0ajoin this Legacy by watching them interact with the objects around them.%0a%0a!!!!Magic%0a%0a:Ruling Arcana: Arcana Type%0a:Yantras: Carrying out maintenance on an object (+1), building an object from scratch using%0ayour hands (+2 when using machines that are powered by the users own muscles, +1 with%0apower tools), laying out plans or scale models, e.g. technical drawing, knitting pattern (+2).%0a:Oblations: Polishing or caring for tools and equipment, knitting, carving or performing other%0ahandcrafts, selecting materials for use in some craft project.%0a%0a!!!!Attainments%0a%0a!!!!!First Attainment: Commanding the Inanimate%0a:Prerequisite: Initiation%0aThe Mage can control mechanical%0aand electrical objects in a fashion%0asimilar to Remote Control (MtA,%0ap155) simply by conversing with it.%0aObjects perform the requests%0amade of them with a maximum dice%0apool of the Mage’s Matter dots.%0a%0a:Optional: Spirit 1%0aThe Mage may address the spirit of an object%0adirectly, as per the spell Exorcist’s Eye (MtA, p180).%0a%0a!!!!!Second Attainment: Exalting the Form%0a:Prerequisite: Matter 2, Crafts 2%0aObjects are inclined to work more efficiently when in the%0ahand of a Lord of the Inanimate. A tool gains the 9-%0aAgain quality as per Find the Balance (MtA, p155).%0a%0a:Optional: Spirit 2%0aThe Mage may transfer Essence to or from the spirit%0aof an object in a fashion similar to Channel Essence%0a(MtA, p180). If channelling to a spirit, the Mage is%0arestricted only by their Gnosis-derived Mana per%0aturn rate. The Mage cannot take Essence from a%0aspirit against their will using this Attainment - they must either have persuaded it or placated it through some other obligation.%0a%0a!!!!!Third Attainment: Shepherd of the Craft%0a:Prerequisites: Matter 3, Persuasion 3%0aWith a touch, the Mage restores a number of Structure%0apoints to a damaged object equal to their dots in Matter.%0aAt the STs discretion this may also provide a bonus to%0afurther negotiations with the object’s spirit.%0a%0a:Optional: Spirit 3%0aThe Mage may also heal the spirit of that object, restoring two boxes of bashing damage for%0aeach dot of Spirit the Mage possesses.%0a%0a!!!!!Fourth Attainment: Name%0a:Prerequisite: Matter 4, Crafts 3%0aThe Mage can grant an object a semblance of life and allow it autonomous movement. The%0aAttainment does not grant physical features that the object does not already possess - a%0ahumanoid statue could serve drinks or fight enemies, but an animated car can only steer%0aitself and open its own doors.\\%0aThis Attainment effectively grants the Mage dots in Retainer equal to their dots in Matter as%0aper Golem (MtA 158). The Mage may elect to renew the duration of at any time before the%0acurrent duration expires, but must be present with the servant to do so.%0a%0a:Optional: Spirit 4%0aThe Mage has the power to grant sentience and self-awareness to an object’s spirit. In%0aaddition to the animation granted above, the Mage may enter into a conversation with the%0aspirit (at least for the length of their Ritual Interval) and use Rouse Spirit (MtA, p182) with%0aAdvanced Duration on the object. For a cost of 1 Mana the effect can be made Indefinite.%0a%0a!!!!!Fifth Attainment: Name%0a:Prerequisite: Matter 5, Persuasion 4%0aAs a person now befitting the title of Lord, the Mage can now reshape matter to their will. By%0atouching an object and speaking gently to it, they may vastly reconfigure an object to any%0adesign.\\%0aThe Mage can reshape Matter in any form as per the Shaping spell (MtA, p156), with Reach%0areducing the required successes for creating intricate shapes by their dots in Matter and%0agranting the ability to shape solid matter. This includes intricate mechanisms and moving%0aparts - the Mage may change a hunk of steel into a complex gear-driven mechanism, for%0aexample. For a cost of 1 Mana, the Mage may affect an object up to Size 15.%0a%0a:Optional: Spirit 5%0aWith their grandest Attainment, a Lord of the Inanimate may reshape an ephemeral being as%0aeasily as solid matter. As per the Shape Spirit spell (MtA, p184), they may invoke a number%0aof effects equal to their dots in Spirit with the option of healing Aggravated damage with%0aMana on a one-for-one basis.

Actions are also less strenuous when moving so efficiently.The Monk gains a +1 bonus on rolls to resist fatigue.

(Ritual Cast, Advanced Duration)%0a%0a:Optional Arcanum: Forces 2\\%0aMore attuned to the subtle changes in temperature, vibration, and all the other minor variations in the forms of energy surrounding her that are often ignored, the Monk becomes able to intuitively feel as well as see forms of electromagnetic radiation, sound, and kinetic energies, allowing her to operate without penalty in complete darkness, and ignore any penalties from the Blindness or Deafness Tilts or Conditions. She can still see and hear and make out details, even in the dark, although colors and tones are somewhat muted. This increased sensitivity does make the Monk more vulnerable to bright lights and loud noises, which may inflict penalties equal to the Blindness condition. (As per Forces 1 Nightvision, Advanced Duration)%0a%0a!!!!!Third Attainment: Chi Force%0a:Prerequisite: Life 3\\%0aThe Monk’s constant exercise regimen has granted him an unparalleled physique, permitting him to channel his chi into it to enhance the potency of musculature, suppleness of ligaments, or rigidity and durability of his frame. So long as the Monk maintains his daily exercise regimen, he may, each day, increase one attribute by his dots in Life for the remainder of the scene up to his normal maximum. (As per Life 3 Honing the Form, Ritual Cast, Advanced Duration)%0a%0a:Optional Arcana: Forces 3\\%0aThe Monk’s Chi can be channeled into more than his mere form, but can be projected out of his form in the manner of kinetic energy. With an instant action, the Monk may channel his chi into his melee attacks, increasing damage and turning it from Bashing into Lethal. Furthermore, any successful attack causes ripples of chi to pass directly through the subject disorientating them and applying the Stunned tilt.

As an Instant Action, the Monk can focus his chi about him; thereafter as a reflexive action he can redirect a number of objects each round equal to his dots in Forces. These must all be of size 5 or less and the monk cannot redirect them unless he could apply his Defense. However, this effect does function against even individuals, allowing the Monk to deflect melee attacks.

The%0aQuiet philosophy asks its adherents to working of magic within the limits of the Fallen World,%0awithin what the Quiescence already draws the line for. Already prone to drawing suspicion from%0aother Awakened, especially that they were Seer fronts, the Legacy lost what tenuous contact it%0amaintained with the larger Awakened society when one of their founders turned Banisher and%0astarted hunting them down.%0a%0aThe Quiet philosophy was largely a product of the 1940s and the 1950s, and when the zeitgeist%0agave way so did the Legacy's main appeal. However, the Liars were always good with keeping%0atheir heads down from the authorities, especially with a murderous Banisher on their trails, and%0aa few Quiet cabals have survived to the modern era. With the advent of communications and%0asocial media technology, there have even been mages who reinvented the Quiet philosophy in%0athe modern age to better hide from prying Sleeper eyes, some of which have successfully%0ainherited the Quiescents' old mantle.%0a%0a!!!!Origins%0a%0a:Parentage: Moros, Guardians of the Veil or Nameless%0a:Background&#8203;: The original Liars drew from war veterans, or those who were affected by the%0aWorld War in one way. They were often comfortable with illegal, if not criminal activities, for the%0aLegacy's founders felt morality less important to their own behavioral code over magic, and%0amorality is best taken in moderation after seeing what horrors a moral man can do. While%0amodern Liars aren't so familiar with war, they are still adept at evading the law and working in%0agrey zones, especially when it comes to avoiding scrutiny.%0a:Appearances&#8203;: Quiescent mages live on the fringe of society, where they can fade into the%0abackground easily. This is easier in the modern era, where big cities that allow such are plenty.%0aLiars dress simply as expected, and get on by with whatever work they find. Many do find work%0aas investigators, or any other occupation where their skills would be needed.%0a%0a!!!!Doctrine%0a%0a:Prerequisites: Time 2, Science 2, two dots in one of the following Skills; Investigation, Stealth,%0aBrawl, Intimidation, Streetwise%0a%0a:Initiation&#8203;: The Legacy draws exclusively from practitioners of Quiet Magic, and even then it's%0ausually the practitioner seeking them out than the Legacy approaching her. In the applicant's%0apursuit the elder Liars judge her ability and character, seeing if she can find them with minimal%0areliance on magic and on others' help.%0a%0a:Organization&#8203;: The Quiescent are one of the most diffused Legacies, the Legacy offering no%0agreater organization to fall back on to and leaving each Liar on their own. The mentor severs%0aregular contact when his pupil learns the Attainment she was calling to him to help on, and the%0apupil likewise moves on until she deems herself progressed enough for the next Attainment.%0a%0a:Theory&#8203;: The Quiescent do not think of the Quiescence as a Lie to be challenged, but just%0aanother principle of Supernal magic that can be worked through and around. They believe that it%0aexists to protect Sleepers from the Awakened so that they may progress without intervention.%0aFurthermore, they believe Quiescence also protect the Awakened from Sleepers so that they%0amay work lesser but more stable wonders, free from Dissonance.%0a%0a!!!!Magic%0a%0a:Ruling Arcana: Time%0a:Yantras: Streets and alleys filled with non-descript buildings (+1); quietly observing the subject%0a(+1); investigatory tools such as magnifiers (+1); confronting but not appearing in front of the%0asubject (+1, +2 if managing the confrontation without verbal interaction)%0a:Oblations&#8203;: Menial chores such as cleaning; solving a puzzle; mixing drinks; shadowing a%0aSleeper or a group of them%0a%0a!!!!Attainments%0a%0a!!!!!First Attainment: No Mistake%0a:Prerequisite: Initiation%0aThe Liar wishes not to disturb the Quiet, so she learns to tread carefully.

I am the life-giving fire, the gentle breeze, and the glorious light. Life and death, creation and destruction. We are one. ”''%0a%0a!!!!Prerequisites%0a%0aWyrd 3, Control Elements •••%0a%0a!!!!Titles%0a%0aSir Tempest, Lady Tempest, Stormborn%0a%0a!!!!Joining%0a%0aThere are two methods of gaining entry into the Tempest Knights. The most common is for a Knight to take a promising prospect as her squire. The squire passes through at least a season of rigorous training and testing of her loyalty, passion, and will to succeed. When the squire's Lord-Knight deems her ready, she is presented to a quorum of her prospective peers. Because of the widespread nature of the Entitlement this process is just as likely to happen by video conference as it is to happen in person. The quorum presents a trial meant to stretch the squire to her physical, mental, and magical limits- and push her beyond them. Successfully completing each task on her own is not required, but having the humility to ask for help is. Asking for help too soon, however, is a sure way to fail. It is a careful balance to strike but the Tempest Knights cannot afford to coddle members. %0a%0aThe second method of joining is exceptionally rare and some even consider it apocryphal. The modern Tempest Knights were founded by several Elementals and a lone Fairest who all felt a call within their souls. It spoke to the water, fire, ice, glass, and light within them and anxiously begged for their aid. They each answered the call and found each other in a large hollow where every element in it was perfectly balanced. It was under attack by hobgoblins attempting to claim it for their own. Together the founders called upon their elements and won the day. The founders claimed that the Entitlement had existed before, that in return for their aid, the elements had shown them the oath of the ancient Entitlement. Every now and then a new Tempest will answer a call for aid or appear at gatherings even though no one knows who they are. The few who claim they were tested and accepted into the Entitlement as the founders were are called Stormborn- though those who don't believe the stories will argue that the Stormborn were simply inducted by a quorum elsewhere in the world. %0a%0a!!!!Mein%0a%0aFlickers of elements creep into a Tempests mien, whipping up stormlets through their hair and across their skin. In the presence of other Tempests their elements blend together. A Tempest with an affinity for ice meeting one bonded to water might produce a hail storm in miniature between their miens when in close proximity. %0a%0a!!!!Background%0a%0aTempest Knights are those who are forced by circumstance to see the advantages of a strong alliance. Each comes from power- social, physical, or mystical but all have acknowledged that their power alone is not enough. Many have lost someone precious that they were supposed to protect or suffered a serious defeat. They have been broken down in one fashion or another and sometimes it leaves scars in their psyche. Many Tempests are affected by persistent Conditions or are simply emotionally fragile. They are keenly aware of their own shortcomings even if they don’t allow it to show. Successful members of the Entitlement are generally well liked in their home courts and Entitlements as they are generous with their talents, and fearless when it comes to defending those that they care about. %0a%0a!!!!Organization%0a%0aFormally, all Tempest Knights are equal. All may call for and expect aid to come but individuals answer to no one but themselves. There is no single Lord-Knight that rules over the others and dictates where they must go. In practice there is a range of influence and respect. The most influential are Free Knights. This is a title given to any who is not bound by oaths that could interfere with the work of the Entitlement. Free Knights spend the majority of their time traveling. They answer calls for aid all across the world, organize meetings of quorums, and train new squires. %0a%0aOn the other end of the spectrum are the those who have refused to answer a call for aid when they could have. It’s the deepest sort of betrayal a Tempest can commit without leaving the Entitlement and those who regularly fail to contribute to the good of the Entitlement are slowly frozen out of society. If they call for help, it will arrive but likely too little and too late to make a difference.%0a%0a!!!!Privileges%0a%0a:Description:%0a%0a'''Stormborn Champion''' - Tempests are unaffected by Environmental Tilts controlled by other members of the Tempest Knights and they add +1 per Tempest Knight present to their effective Wyrd when using any elemental Contract. This bonus includes the individual activating the contract and alone she gains +1 effective Wyrd.%0a%0a!!!!Rumors of the Tempest Knights%0a%0a*One of the Founders of the Tempest Knights went mad and ran off back to Arcadia. She comes back every now and then, calling for aid. Anyone who answers the call is never seen again. Worse though is that sometimes she’ll come if a Tempest calls for help. Word is that a Tempest in Illapel, Chile asked for help against a loyalist who had sworn a vendetta. Every loyalist in the area disappeared but half the freehold was destroyed in the tsunami too. %0a%0a*The Stormborn are not actually changelings. They are elemental hobs that can mimic Changeling form. No one knows what they want, but they were never human and the Tempests are still bound to help them with whatever they ask.   %0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Justicars of Themis''%0a%0a''“I solemnly vow that I will defend the Dream against all enemies; that I will bear true faith to the sword and scales of Themis; that I make this vow freely, without any reservation or evasion, and that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the office of which I am about to enter.”''%0a%0aWhen those with power brush up alongside those without, abuses will happen. Laws declared by human or even changeling authorities have no sway over hobgoblins and oneiroi and yet there are still customs and natural laws- Mores that dictate what is acceptable and what is not. There are lines that most creatures instinctively hesitate to cross. Dreams are where mortals most often brush up against the fae world, and it’s here that the Justicars of Themis have drawn a line in the sand.  %0a%0aJusticars rarely view themselves as aristocrats. Most still think of themselves as common changelings who have stepped up to perform a particularly difficult and onerous duty. The Justicars cannot prevent every terrible deed that happens and so they focus their efforts on a minimum standard of behavior for those who dabble in oneiromancy. They do not consider the Mores to be law as that would imply they would need proper jurisdictional authority to enforce them. Mores run deeper in that and are born from a common instinct of what must not be. %0a%0a:'''The Mores''':%0a%0a*'''Mixing Blood:''' Physical relations between an incubus and a mortal that result in the birth of a Cambion must not be. %0a%0a*'''Mental Battery:''' Complete destruction, drastic or permanent mental alteration, or the enslavement of an innocent's mind must not be. %0a%0a*'''Plague Bearing:''' Spreading Dream Poison must not be. %0a%0a*'''Murder:''' Using dreams to murder mortals must not be. %0a%0a!!!!Prerequisites%0a%0aWyrd 2, Investigation 4 (additional for higher ranks, see below) %0a%0a!!!!Titles%0a%0aJusticar, Scales (Slang) %0a%0a!!!!Joining%0a%0aJusticars of Themis deliberately recruit changelings with sharp eyes and minds as well as those with a strong moral compass. Oftentimes the lowest ranking members Entitlement come across recruits when they travel in pursuit of a suspect and pass word of them up the chain of command. The Banner in charge of the regional office will then come pay the recruit a visit in their dreams and make the offer. The recruit may reject the offer at first and the Justicars will step back and watch for a year and a day. If the recruit is still considered worthy after that time they will arrange for word of a violation of the Mores to reach them. If the recruit acts on the information then the Justicars will make the offer a second time. If the offer is rejected again the process is repeated. Only after a third rejection will the Justicars leave the recruit in peace. %0a%0a!!!!Mein%0a%0aUpon joining the Justicars of Themis, a changeling's eyes become a bright neon blue. As her Wyrd increases the blue grows out around her eyes, through the Justicar's veins. Those with high Wyrd find that their blood is completely neon blue and also becomes luminescent. %0a%0a!!!!Background%0a%0aThere are many paths that can lead a changeling to join the Justicars of Themis. For some it is a matter of idealism and a way to protect mortals while others join because they've seen the damage that violating the Mores can cause firsthand. A rare few have even violated the Mores themselves in the past and join the Justicars as means of making amends. Members tend to be intelligent and highly skilled oneiromancers with the physical skills to survive the rigors of the Hedge as well as their enemies. %0a%0a!!!!Organization%0a%0aThe Justicars of Themis maintain a strict command structure across the globe though the bureaucracy of the organization is minimal and the vast majority of members never become involved in the upper ranks of the order. %0a%0a!!!!Shields%0a%0aJusticars enter the Entitlement as a Shield and most never move beyond it. Changelings fulfilling this roll work in their hometown and freehold to protect the dreams of the mortals around them. They investigate any rumors of violations of the mores, hunt cambions, and sometimes try to help heal those whose dreams have been ravaged. Many also develop extensive networks of informants in the Hedge and keep an eye out for any potential new recruits. Shields report their activities up the chain of command but generally have free reign to protect their area as they see fit. %0a%0a!!!!Swords%0a%0a'''Prerequisites''':  Weaponry 4, Merit: Command Intensity •%0a%0aSwords are Justicars who have gone beyond the basic prerequisites of the Entitlement. They have extensive practice not just as investigators but also as deadly hunters. Many oneiroi and cambions are exceptionally dangerous and Swords are often called in when a situation proves too difficult for a Shield to handle alone. In average day to day operations they act just as Shields do but must also be available to travel within a wider region at a moment's notice. %0a%0a!!!!Banners%0a%0a'''Prerequisites''':  Empathy 3, Politics 3, Socialize 3 %0a%0aBanners sit at the head of a regional office situated in the largest cities in the world: New York, Sao Paulo, Seoul, Mumbai, Cairo, Los Angeles, Paris, London, Chicago, and others all support a regional office with the Shields of the surrounding areas reporting to them. If any need extra support then it's the Banner that arranges for one of the Swords to come. Tokyo is the single largest office and doubles as the Justicar's international headquarters. The Banner of Tokyo serves as the Chief Justicar of the Entitlement and any inter-regional cases falls under her authority. %0a%0a!!!!Privileges%0a%0a:Description:%0a%0a'''The Scales of Horai (•••)'''- The Scales of Horai are a miniature set of brass scales that hang from a heavy sapphire ring. It is the badge of office for a Justicar and when worn a drop of their blood may be balanced against a bit of dirt or dust taken from the area. Upon activation an incubus emerges from the sapphire and ordered to aid the Justicar with a single task. The task may be extended, such as navigating the Hedge or interrogating a hob witness, but once the task is complete it vanishes back into the sapphire. While the incubus is highly intelligent and reputed to be incredibly dangerous the Scales of Horai limit the incubus' abilities to those of its jailer. Mechanically, the incubus has the same dice pools as the character and they may apply teamwork to rolls. %0a%0aAction: Standard %0a%0aMien: When active, the sapphire glows with an inner light turns blood red. %0a%0aDrawback: The next time the user sleeps, the incubus is granted access to her dreams where it has the ability to create a False Memory Dream. %0a%0aCatch: Once the incubus has completed their task, they do not return to the ring. Instead they are free to act as it will for an entire scene, oftentimes turning on the user violently in an effort to break free from its prison. %0a%0a!!!!Rumors of the Justicars of Themis%0a%0a*The Justicars hardly ever execute people who violate their Mores, even when they say they did. Instead they take them to a prison deep in the Hedge where the True Fae can take their pick of the prisoners. In exchange, the Huntsmen usually follow their rules. %0a*Everyone knows the Justicars have a pet incubus that helps them but what most miss is that they have an entire network of oneiroi to slip into people's dreams and spy for them. They can track people, learn everything about them, and manipulate their minds without anyone ever knowing. %0a*They say that if one of the oneiroi breaks free it'll devour the Justicar and take their place and considering how well the creature knows them, it could put on an act that's convincing enough to fool even the people closest to them. %0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''The Principality of the Crooked Tongue''%0a%0a%25center%25''“Listen with your eyes and not your ears. The words I speak are naught but pleasant distractions and magicians' misdirection. Do this and you will begin to read the lines of power, governance, truth, lies, and glamour.”''%0a%0aLies come naturally to humanity. It is an instinct children develop before they can even speak and they hone it while manipulating their parents. Lies are important. They can keep an individual out of trouble, advance a career, and tear down enemies when applied appropriately. The Principality of the Crooked Tongue are masters of the lie and its members are often social titans among their freehold and courts- expert liars and manipulators who can twist people around their fingers with ease. What each and every one of them realize is that truth is not in words but in deeds. %0a%0aThe Principality is a secret society. Most members do not know precisely who the others of the Entitlement are as gatherings are an exercise in lies where individuals will go to extensive magical and mundane lengths to hide their identity. Princes and princesses are willing to work cross purpose in freehold and court matters but beneath the petty politics is a far more primal alliance dedicated to the fundamental principle of upholding the greater oaths that protect changeling society itself such as freehold bulwarks and the courts themselves. Without these, Huntsmen would run rampant and society itself would crumble. %0a%0aChangelings know how vital these institutions are, but it is often lost in the day to day pressures of courtly intrigue. The Principality uses every ounce of guile and social expertise to manipulate the courts and freeholds around them into upholding their responsibilities- and if they come out of the process with an incredible amount of wealth, a courtly title, and favors owed to them then all the better. %0a%0a!!!!Prerequisites%0a%0aWyrd 4, Subterfuge 4, Empathy 3 %0a%0a!!!!Titles%0a%0aPrince/ Princess%0a%0a!!!!Joining%0a%0aEvery word a Princess of the Crooked Tongue speaks is false or misdirection, and those who join their ranks are changelings who can successfully read their motives through their lies or misdirect and defeat one of the Principality in a social contest. If a member finds a good prospect, they will extend a discrete invitation- not in lying words but by deed. The invitation plays out as a careful courtship extending a tentative offer for an alliance mixed with tests of integrity to make sure the prospective member will uphold the greater oaths. The prospective member may not even realize the potential outcome until she accepts an alliance with the Principality and is given the choice to swear to the order.%0a%0a!!!!Mein%0a%0aThe mien of a member of the Principality always contains some golden symbol of authority. The form can vary greatly but it it always something that the changeling considers a symbol of authority. Common forms include golden coronet, torc, a key or badge pinned to chest, or even a golden tattoo. Due to the secretive nature of the Entitlement, some members go to great lengths to hide or disguise the change to their mien.  %0a%0a!!!!Background%0a%0aMost members of the Principality are social powerhouses with their courts with a high Wits, Intelligence, and a focus on social traits. Many are incredibly influential before they ever join but the stereotype isn't always ring true. Some have never cared for power and instead focus their attention on the mortal world. They keep their ears open and gather intelligence. Some are simply pathological liars. No matter where they come from, Princes and Princesses all have a reason to lie. They have all learned from experience that even words that seem true can be twisted. Loopholes in pledges can be found, and words are merely a tool for manipulating those who aren't smart enough to read the underlying truth of a situation. They have been taken advantage of in some fashion and in order to never allow it to happen again, they armor themselves in lies of their own weaving. %0a%0a!!!!Organization%0a%0aThe Principality primarily gathers in cities where multiple freeholds stand side by side. In each city the Principality is ruled by a Grand Master, a title granted to the most experienced and cunning of their number. The Princes and Princesses beneath her report any machinations they come across that could put the greater oaths at risk and she may then make assignments across the Entitlement to take appropriate measures. %0a%0aBesides the Grand Master, members of the Entitlement generally do not know everyone else that is a member. Complete secrecy is impossible, of course, but it becomes a game within the Principality to see how many of their colleagues they can identify while remaining covert. Meetings are in person and other methods of communication are generally not trusted- they make it too easy to lie. %0a%0a:Fitting In:%0a%0a!!!!Concepts%0a%0a!!!!Privileges%0a%0a'''Tongue of Eyes and Lies'''- Upon joining the Entitlement, all Princes and Princesses gain the 8-again quality to Subterfuge rolls as well as the three-dot Aura Reading merit. Instead of Willpower, they use glamour to activate it. Upon activation the changeling can see an aura of the Wyrd and watch how it ebbs and flows around an individual to read their intentions and emotions. %0a%0a!!!!Rumors of the Principality of the Crooked Tongue%0a%0a*You can't trust a Prince or Princess of the Crooked Tongue no matter how sincere they sound or what pledges they make to you. They lie so often and so well that even the Wyrd is fooled and can't hold them to their word. %0a*Some claim the Principality serves the freehold and courts but they'll betray them every time. They're not just pathological liars, they're infiltrators and traitors if not outright loyalists. Good luck proving it though, most are too good to be caught. %0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Satrapy of Pearls''%0a%0a''“I vow to never turn down an offer to buy, barter, or sell.  Even happiness can be bought and sold, including my own.”''%0a%0aThe Pearl Satraps of the Spring Court believe that their happiness is paramount above all things.  Not satisfied with mere contentment, the Satraps seek bliss whenever possible.  Bliss, however, is rarely easy to come by, and never free.  One always finds a cost associated, and the Pearl Satraps have chosen not only to accept that cost but to embrace it.%0a%0aAll things are up for purchase, sale or trade. That is the single overriding principle of the Satrapy of Pearls. But it’s not just about cars, real estate, old books or new technology. They embrace such material wealth, absolutely. The Satraps are glad to possess and enjoy all the toys the world has to offer — and they are equally glad to offer those toys in exchange for other things. Money and luxury are the feathers in every Satrap’s cap. But that’s all wealth is: trifling feathers, mere ornamentation. The Satrapy’s interest goes far deeper.%0a%0aAnd that cuts to the heart of the matter: everything is for sale, not just objects and luxuries. Sex, love, hate, betrayal, sorrow… all lie waiting on the auction block, but only the Pearl Satraps believe themselves wise enough to %0asee it and take advantage of it. Commerce extends beyond selling  land  or  buying  somebody’s  horse.  A  pretty  girl’s heart is for sale, always, but it takes more than money to get it (usually, at least). And every girl is different, her heart demanding a different price from different suitors. One requires a ready kindness, another asks for casual abuse. Her tears, too, are for up sale for those who know the costs. Her tears, scars, memories, desires — all available to those willing to see the value and pay the price. They can be bottled. They can be sold.%0a%0aAnd so, this is what the Pearl Satraps do. On one hand, they please themselves above all others. They go out in the world and what they see, they want, and what they want, they purchase. It’s a mad game to serve their vanity, but what else does one have if one is without the joy of conceit? One Satrap sees a silver locket around a woman’s neck, and that  locket  holds  the  picture  of  her  dearly  departed  husband. Oh, but the Satrap wants it, and the woman assures him that she’ll never give it up. But she will. Maybe money will do the trick (people love money more than they’d care to admit, the Satraps say).  If not that, then something else.  The return of a lost child?  A threat against her dear friend?  Revenge against a cruel boss?  She'll give the locket up when the Satrap sounds the right price.  And he'll take it only when she's conceded to that price; no Satrap will accept something without first paying the proper cost.  Nor will he ever steal, for thievery is anathema to this noble order.  Nothing is free.  To act as if it is means a willful refutation of those principles the Satrapy hold dear.%0a%0aIt’s not just about one’s own happiness, though. Many Pearl Satraps place themselves as procurators for others, be they changelings, mortals or any of the odd strangers that skulk  around  the edges of the freehold.  Everybody knows that if you need something bad enough, the Satrapy of Pearls can get it for you. A draught of a child’s blood? The heel from the left shoe of the Winter Court Queen? A simple apology whispered in one’s ear beneath the last full moon of Autumn?  Of course.  What’s desired can be purchased, the Satraps assure. %0a%0a!!!!Prerequisites%0a%0aWyrd 3, Persuasion 3, Spring Court Mantle 2%0a%0a!!!!Titles%0a%0aSatraps, Pearl Satraps%0a%0a!!!!Joining%0a%0aOne must belong to the Spring Court to join the Satrapy of Pearls. The noble order considers the other Courts to have missed the point, thus eschewing the potential of life and the magic that accompanies it. Life is meant to be enjoyed, and if one cannot understand that most basic of concepts, then one does not deserve membership of such noble standing.%0a%0aOne must still prove oneself worthy of the Satrapy of Pearls, however. The proof demanded is simple enough to understand, but often difficult to procure. One must first gain audience with a Pearl Satrap, which isn’t difficult as most are glad for the conversation (and the possibility of commerce). In asking for acceptance into the Satrapy, one only needs the say-so from a single other Satrap. In obtaining that say-so, however, the changeling must accept a challenge of commerce as determined by the Satrap. The Satrap will demand that the changeling acquire something from someone: a love letter, a favorite brooch, an embarrassing memory, whatever. In obtaining this, the changeling cannot steal or inveigle it freely. It must be acquired by finding a price and paying that price — which is what the Satraps do every day. If the changeling is incapable of playing that game and comprehending the give-and-take of universal commerce, then she doesn’t belong among the Pearl Satraps.%0a%0a!!!!Mein%0a%0aPearl Satraps dress well as an emblem to project their luxury.  The Satrapy has  no shared standard for style, and so one changeling might prefer the modern trappings of haute couture, while another might traipse about in a lavish (even gaudy) silken robe once worn by some ancient Persian governess. Ostentatious displays, while rarely tasteful, work to affirm a Satrap’s commitment to wealth of some kind.%0a%0aA Satrap’s mien shifts slightly, too. Mostly, it simply reflects impeccable grooming: not a hair out of place, perfect nails, heavenly skin. The other change to a Satrap’s mien  happens to his eyes: they become pearlescent, as if they are not eyes at all but perfect pearls thrust into the sockets. It’s difficult to tell when a Satrap is looking at you, as his pupils are lost in a sea of opaline white. As a Satrap’s Wyrd increases, however, the mortal world begins to feel it. Those with Greed as a Vice have trouble resisting their own avarice, overtaken by a palpable hunger as the Satrap passes by. Mortals may believe that the changeling suffers from some kind of cataract, as well, seeing past  the  human  guise  and  peering into those unnerving eyes.%0a%0a!!!!Background%0a%0aIt’s  easy  to  assume that those who join the Satrapy of  Pearls  were  always  narcissistic  power-mongers believing themselves to be the cream that floats so easily to the top. Certainly this is true for some, but not for the bulk of the order. No, most Pearl Satraps have had to claw their way up from the bottom, and that’s how the Satrapy prefers it. Those who have been poor, destitute or otherwise outcast are the ones who know the true hunger necessary to wear the seeming of the Satraps. And, by proxy, those who know the hunger can therefore experience the true joy of feeding that hunger. It’s not just about searching out the mad joie de vivre that comes with  the  purchase  of  10  favors  from  nine women or about the sale of one old man’s lifelong dreams, but it’s about experiencing it wholly. It’s about appreciating it.%0a%0aSome  Satraps  even  seek  out  those who lurk at the bottom of the food chain and offer a casual reminder that it merely takes the will to pull oneself out of the gutter and climb the ladder that leads to the stars. They don’t offer any other help beyond those few words, because a future Satrap must claw his own way up from the underbelly.%0a%0aWorth noting, too, is that not all Satraps end up wealthy.  Yes most do, as it's their bread and butter (and a symbol of status within the order). But a Satrap can just as easily be a filthy beggar in a back alley, glee-fully offering his strange services for a handful of coins or a curious bauble. More important than the status of wealth is evidence of one’s conquests in this world of makeshift commerce. Few Satraps care to live without luxury, though, and a truly destitute member of this order is quite rare. (There-fore, most possess Resources 2 at the bare minimum.)%0a%0aObviously, what the Satraps do requires them to have a strong reliance on their Social Traits, with Presence and Manipulation usually being higher than average. Any Social Skill, with the exception of Animal Ken for the most part, requires attention; the Satraps can use any of these Skills to work out the parameters of a trade or purchase.%0a%0a!!!!Organization%0a%0aThe Satrapy cares little for formal organization. Its members can operate alone or together, it matters little. Provided they uphold the oath given to the other Pearl Satraps, then any sense of unity is thrown to the wind.%0a%0aTwo exceptions to this laissez-faire attitude exist, both of which are events held annually by the Satrapy. Each event bookends the season of Spring. Within the first week of the season,  the  Pearl  Satraps  hold  what’s  formally  known  as the Opal Auction of the Springtide Pearl, but most know it simply as, “The Auction.” Every Satrap is expected to bring one or several treasures to the table and bid them off at a gala affair (catered to every strange taste, serviced by ensorcelled). The Auction represents a time to show off, as well as a time to demonstrate the Satrapy’s considerable skills at obtaining things people might want. It often leaves the changelings of the freehold talking for weeks. How did that Satrap secure a single night’s worth of boot-polishing and  floor-scrubbing  from  the  Winter  Court’s  second-in-command? Just what kind of creature waited within that blood-colored egg, twitching as it did on the silver platter? How does one keep grief in an oaken puzzle box?%0a%0aThe second event is reserved only for the Satraps themselves. At the end of the season, the Pearl Satraps come together for a kind of brag session and show-and-tell, talking about all their successes and failures. Every Satrapy does it differently. One might rent a yacht and sit upon its deck, breathing in the smoldering narcotic fumes of the seeds of strange fruits brought from the Hedge. Others might relax in club chairs in an air-conditioned room or gather in some poor human’s penthouse suite (with the mortal bound up and made to witness the affair, his mind reeling with what he sees and hears).%0a%0aAfter these events, the Pearl Satraps might go the rest of the year without even talking to one another, though certainly there exists an informal network of back-scratching and info-giving. Remember, though, that each Pearl Satrap represents friendly competition for every other Pearl Satrap. He who has the most toys, relatively speaking, wins.%0a%0a!!!!Concepts%0a%0aAcquisitions attorney, eccentric antiquarian, gleeful mammonite, high-price prostitute, Iago, procurer of pledges, snake-oil salesman, spider in the center of a web.%0a%0a!!!!Privileges%0a%0a'''Avaricious Finesse'''- Buying and selling is everything to the Satraps. She can automatically add one success to any successful roll to buy or sell something. Additionally, she may spend a Glamour to add her Wyrd to Presence and Manipulation rolls for the rest of the scene. Also, the Satrap is able to judge the fair market value of any merchandise or service on sight, be it mundane or supernatural. Mundane attempts to force her into a bad deal, or to disguise the value of something automatically fail. Supernatural powers which would force her into a bad deal, or used to disguise the value of something, automatically cause a Clash of Wills (the Satrap using Wits+Wyrd).%0a%0a!!!!Rumors of the Satrapy%0a%0a* Somehow, the Satraps always have a small item from every Court's King or Queen except those of the Spring Court. The item is usually small — a single earring, a lucky coin, a knob from one of their dressers — but rumor has it that this small item gives the Satrap major power over the ruler. The Satraps must forge tokens from these items. %0a*Every Satrap has a secret treasure trove somewhere in the city, usually just outside the freehold’s accepted borders. The boxes are usually fire-safe and locked with three different locks (usually padlocks). The Satrap buries the treasure trove or hides it. Each box is supposed to contain all manner of wonders and horrors. A Fairest from the next city over said she found a haunted money clip, a bullet in a jar tagged with a label that read ‘magic’ and a necklace made of seven severed fingers. After discovering it, she went missing three days later. %0a*The Satraps know Contracts that nobody else knows, though stories suggest they made terrible bargains to get them. They know some every old and very strange Goblin Contracts, as well. Remember that the Satraps have their price. They’ll teach them, but the cost will be steep.%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''The Parliament of Victors''%0a%0a''“It’s good to be the champ. I’ll do what needs doing to stay champ. I’ll win. I’ll kill.

They are only sleeping at the bottom of our mind, waiting for our call.  We have need for them.  They represent the wisdom of our race: the old ways.”''%0a%0aAt  the  dawn of  humanity,  powerful spirits  walked  the  borders between  the  earthly  and  the  supernatural. The eldest artworks of Neolithic times depict beings too fanciful to be man, beast, or any other wholly terrestrial thing. Perhaps these entities were the Others, their images captured in ochre and charcoal on the innermost walls of ancient caverns, but some Lost believe that these crude drawings are, instead, images of their own kind —  admired, feared,  and even worshipped by primitive mortals. They think back to a more primal and mysterious age, an age during which it seems that the otherworldly  walked  side-by-side  with  the  mundane, and a balance existed between gods and men. These changelings have resolved to be those very gods in a jaded modern world.%0a%0aThis eldritch order is an old one; older, perhaps, than the very notion of “noble title,” and aligned with powers that predate such things as agriculture, walled settlements, and the written word. While many of the outsiders  that  know  of  the  Lost  Pantheon  doubt  its claim to such extreme antiquity, few deny the primordial energies that are harnessed within each changeling who takes up its banner. Of course, the feudal, almost pseudo-medieval society of the Lost does not necessarily react well to the emergence of one or more primitive would-be gods whose beliefs are in keeping with an epoch that knew nothing of civilization, let alone kings and queens, knights and barons. Friction often exists between the status quo and the fae of the Lost Pantheon, due to mutual unfamiliarity, if nothing else, though the raw power and faded Clarity (and often somewhat skewed morality inherent to both) common  to  changelings  sworn  to this  entitlement often makes their presence a matter of uncomfortable coexistence, rather than something  to  be  actively driven out.%0a%0aBeasts and Elementals are the seemings most called to the Lost Pantheon, though any changeling inclined toward a primal vision of the world and willing to draw power from that  vision (and those mortals that still subscribe to it, to one degree or another) can be drawn to this entitlement. In modern times, the mortals most commonly associated with these beliefs are practitioners of the so-called Old Ways, religious systems with roots  stretching  back  to  pre-civilization  archetypes that the changelings come to embody: Earth Mothers and Sun Fathers, Bear Women and Wolf Men, and other such atavistic icons. While the practices have %0achanged,  their  foundations  remain,  echoing  down from  the  remotest  antiquity,  from  the  very  first  humans to recognize and acknowledge the existence of the supernatural world. Indeed, the so-called Ancients of the Lost Pantheon reflect an age when the distinction between the natural and the supernatural was a line so thin as to be invisible to all save the most cunning and discerning of holy men and wise women.%0a%0aOf course, these ideals descended down, through the ages, with rough-hewn divinities taking on sharper edges in the crucible of civilization. However, the fundamental aspects of their origins as the unfathomable gods of hunter-gatherers remained. And, so it is that some Ancients embody newer (though still quite ancient) concepts, drawn from such inspirations as Zeus, Gnowee, Thor, Agni, Punga, Coyolxauhqui, Nemain, Anubis, Coyote, Okuninushi, or other such deities, some of whom are venerated even  in modern times. Always, these Ancients are conscious of the primordial origins of the god-forms that they represent. Even more contemporary conceptions of such figures include Bloody Mary (a spirit of death), the Jersey Devil (a chimera), the phantom hitchhiker (who may be a guide to lead people back to the proper path, or a trickster to lead them astray), the chupacabra (a feral vampire), and the black dog (a reimagining of dogs’ traditional association with the Underworld). All of these sorts of divinities can eke out a place within the order, if they are but willing to accept their great station and to celebrate their godliness.%0a%0a!!!!Prerequisites%0a%0aWyrd  6+,  Mantle  (Any)  4,  Clarity 8+.  If Clarity drops below 8 the benefits end till clarity goes back to 8+.%0a%0a!!!!Titles%0a%0aAncient, Daemon, Totem, Goddess, Kami, Demigod, God, Loa, or  other such titles, as appropriate to the culture of the individual changeling.%0a%0a!!!!Joining%0a%0aAs informal as this  eldritch  order  is, it should be no surprise that there is no one single initiation into the Lost Pantheon. In fact, it’s rare that one Ancient initiates another. Most feel the call in their dreams, guided by the power of their own Wyrd onto a path that was first trod long ago. %0a%0a!!!!Mein%0a%0aAncients  of  the  Lost  Pantheon  often  eschew modern trappings, though this tendency is not %0auniversal and some few strike a balance between primordial  practices  and  contemporary  existence.  Far more  common,  however,  are  those  that  deal  almost exclusively with the mortals of their cults, and otherwise keep to the company of the Lost and other beings that dwell beyond the purview of the mundane world. Hedge-spun  garments  are  common  to  the  Ancients, as are clothes made from traditional materials, such as pelts and skins, plant fibers, and the like. Simple jewelry, tattoos and even scarification may adorn a given Ancient’s body, and many of them have great difficulty passing among modern mortals.%0a%0aNo  single  specific  change  develops  in  the  mien of a member of the Lost Pantheon. Rather, such fae tend simply to become more of what they are, forsaking human appearance for that of their faerie selves: an Elemental of flame transforms into a living conflagration, while a pallid and vaguely necrotic Gravewight comes to look the part of a mummified lich-lord, and a vaguely equine Beast takes on hooves and a windswept mane and seems forever in motion, even when standing  still.  As  Wyrd  increases,  these  changes  become increasingly pronounced; particularly potent Ancients actually appear, in many ways, to outside observers like the earthly gods that they believe themselves to be. At the greatest heights of Wyrd, such changelings begin to bend the manifestations of their Mantles, compelling even the blessings of the seasons to conform to  their  “godly  attributes.”  Thus,  a  Winter  Darkling whose divine aspect is one of hidden places might find a  frozen  fog  envelops  her  at  all  times,  or  a  Summer Ogre embodying primal hunger might manifest licking  flames  within  his  mouth  that  occasionally  drop embers to consume random small flammable objects, such as papers, dry leaves, and the like.%0a%0a%0a!!!!Background%0a%0aPinning down a “type” of changeling drawn to the Lost Pantheon is difficult, at best. Some come to the entitlement out of a sense of arrogance, to be sure, though many do not. Some grasp for anything to help them with fading Clarity, while others feel, deep down, that they truly are  divine  creatures;  or,  at  least, those  things  worshipped  as  divine by  primitive  humanity.  The  reasons are  many,  and  any  given  would-be mentor might have wildly  different  standards  regarding a prospective student than any other Ancient. The only commonality between those entitled  is  that  they  feel  called  to the  Lost  Pantheon’s  raw,  elemental power — the sense of being something far more than mortal, both for good and for ill.%0a%0aPotent  Wyrd  and  strong Mantles  certainly  play  into  the transformations  of  perception necessary to accept entitlement as an Ancient, but it goes deeper  than  that.  Changelings from  more  traditional,  superstitious, or mystical backgrounds tend to be likelier to embrace the way of the Lost Pantheon, as do those whose human memories and ideals were almost completely scoured away by especial cruel Durances. Perhaps most important to note is  the  fact  that  prospective  Ancients are not  fleeing from their scarred and mutilated humanity; they sincerely believe that they are not human anymore — that Arcadia has already destroyed anything in them that was mortal and replaced it with a wonderful, terrible power of godly origin. Even the most humble Ancient (and they are few) sincerely cleaves to the notion that she is a god clothed in flesh and most implicitly believe so, whether or not they could adequately articulate the notion, even before being accepted into the Lost Pantheon.%0a%0a%0a!!!!Organization%0a%0aThe  Lost  Pantheon has little in the way of organization. Just as the most ancient divine powers  venerated  by  humanity had little  in  the  way  of  formalized  relationships, so, too, do most Ancients forsake a rigid hierarchy or other such linear interconnection. Instead, members of the Lost Pantheon often deal with one another as their respective natures demand: an  ocean  father may forever rage at an earth  mother, but  feel a kinship toward a moon goddess, or hold  a  storm  god  to  be  a brother. Ancients need not mentor those who embody godforms similar to their own and may even entitle those  with  aspects  hostile  to  their own, as divinity is often intemperate  and  requires  conflict.  Thus, any attempt to categorize the interactions between  Ancients  is more often than not doomed to futility.%0a%0aIn places in which two or more Ancients come together (rare, indeed, in modern times), they tend to organize into a sort of “divine family,” arranged according to their godly archetypes. This may involve friendship, alliance, mutual respect, polite avoidance, simmering dislike, outright enmity, or any combination of the above. Individual personalities do not figure into their relationships quite so much as the requirements of their more primal attributes. A primal hunter and an aspect of a prey animal, for example, may,  as  people  and  as  changelings,  have compatible personalities and be thoroughly capable of coexisting as friends but, as Ancient of the Lost Pantheon, they are opposites in the same cycle of life and death, and their divine characteristics demand distance between them. There need not be antagonism between them — as the hunter and the hunted belong to a single natural  process  —  but  close  friendship  cannot  grow between them, as they are divided from one another by their appointed roles.%0a%0a%0a:Fitting In:%0a%0a''Finding a way to blend back into mortal society is a fundamental part of the story of Changeling: The Lost. How, then, do the Ancients of the Lost Pantheon embody this theme? After all, they seem to spend most of their time actively seeking out and embracing the supernatural aspects of the world, while blatantly denying their former mortality, and they don’t — on the surface — appear to have any interest in rebuilding their connections to humanity. But that’s just the thing; the goals and motivations of the Lost Pantheon are in many crucial ways the same as those of any changeling, just realized in a significantly different way.%0a%0aThe Ancients do work to build a tie to mortals — a distorted and disturbing sort of tie, but a tie, nonetheless. The fact of the matter is that, like all fae, those of the Lost Pantheon are damaged in spirit, with scars that mar their souls and make them unlike the people all around them. Forced to exist a half-step apart from the life that they once possessed, the Ancients strive to be something that hurts less, something that doesn’t remind them so much of what has been taken from them, and they do so by becoming important to the mortals who venerate them. Like the good cop who returns from Arcadia and becomes a violent vigilante, or the psychiatrist whose Durance transforms her into a skilled oneiromancer, the changelings who turn to the Lost Pantheon cobble together a new self out of what they can recall from before the Thorns, the hurts that were done to them by the Gentry, and the shreds of a life that they can pick up after stumbling out of the Hedge.''%0a%0a%0a!!!!Concepts%0a%0aCult leader, reincarnated god, mystical transhumanist, incarnated dream, mad prophet, borderline solipsist, would-be True Fae.%0a%0a!!!!Privileges%0a%0a'''Primordial Incarnation (•••••)'''- The powers of the Lost Pantheon reveal the path of its members’ supposed “divine transformation” into the entities venerated by humanity in remotest antiquity. Forsaking mortal perspective is easier to an ancient and to embrace the wyrd instead is to embrace their truest nature.  Upon embracing the wyrd the ancient is treated as having a wyrd of two higher for the purposes of dice they can add per turn.%0a%0a'''Quintessence and Ambrosia (•••••)''' - Most Ancient’s begin to experience an existence that is filled with the gentle whispers of their worshippers or those who worship the idea of them.  It’s intrinsic to an Ancient as they take on the role of the old gods from long ago.  They form a sort of painless melody within the glamour saturated essence of their soul, a familiar, constant hum that the god feels somewhat in the way someone would feel a song stuck in the back of her mind.  These small offerings offer the Ancient a chance to harvest once a day even when alone.  When in the presence of their followers a harvest grants one extra glamour.%0a%0aMost of the time, though, an Ancient won’t recognize a prayer’s source.  The voice will be lost in the sea of infinite notes playing out the prayer song.  With concentration (and the expenditure of a willpower point), a god can sometimes listen closely to pick out a single prayer, especially if the practitioner is desperate or passionate.  If one voice rises above the rest, an exceptionally successful prayer, the Ancient can’t help but notice the request.  Such prayers are loud and clear enough that the Ancient can distinguish the petitioner’s general wishes.  Whether the Ancient choses to answer or not is ultimately up to them.  Gods can be fickle things but magic to appear suddenly before the practitioner is something beyond the scope of initiation.  However, hearing this prayer counts as a sympathetic connection to the practitioner and if the Ancient is capable of it they can target them with magic.%0a%0a%0a'''Terrestrial Deity (•••••)''' -  Lastly the Ancient’s of the Lost Pantheon stand firm against the insane influence of the others. What is a god without their worshippers?  The Gentry seek out the faithful, the creative, the masterful, and the unique. The compassionate among the Ancient feel a strong sense of duty in protecting their followers while the pragmatic look at those soft voices under threat of the Gentry as just another number.  The Ancient gains the connected condition with their followers once per chapter and gains a +3 bonus to defy, attack, of defend against the Gentry, their powers, or their minions.%0a%0a!!!!Rumors of the Ancients%0a%0aThe Lost Pantheon is an object of awe and dread to many of the changelings that know of its existence. Given the potent Wyrd and Mantles with which its members must be favored, it is easy to see the Ancients as the demigods that they believe themselves to be, and the rumors that surround the entitlement thus tend to reflect the raw power with which the Lost Pantheon is blessed. Conversely, fae can be jealous of the mystic might of the Lost Pantheon and terrified of its inhuman nature, and so fearful gossip also circulates with regard to this eldritch order and its membership.%0a%0a*The Ancients of the Lost Pantheon eventually become True Fae, themselves, when all of their Clarity is — inevitably — at long last, gone. Whether the process is gradual or abrupt, however, none can truly say. Some claim that Ancients wander off into the Thorns, only to later emerge as Gentry, while others believe that they suddenly slough off their human masks entirely and embrace the power and madness of Arcadia all at once.%0a%0a*The Lost Pantheon keeps gateways into realms of spirit that have nothing to do with the Thorns or distant Arcadia, which may be the otherworlds believed in by ancient mortal societies. Gods and monsters utterly alien to Arcadia wander in those forgotten places, and the Ancients may be enslaved to them. Or, perhaps, they are the masters, and those inhuman entities are their servants. %0a%0a*Ancients gather once a century to hunt the Others who stalk (or are trapped in) either the Hedge or the mortal world, having long ago learned rituals used to extract the power, and perhaps even the immortality, of the Gentry. For a staggeringly steep price, they might be willing to teach these grim rites to those not sworn into their order, though the prize would almost certainly not be worth the cost. Some rumors say that accepting such a boon from an Ancient binds a changeling’s soul to that Ancient’s will, while others believe that even attempting the process is fatal to one not numbered among the Lost Pantheon.%0a%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a(:include GameRef.Directoryhelp:)%0a%0aThe Storytelling System, Beast the Primordial, Changeling the Lost, Chronicles of Darkness, Demon the Descent, Mage the Awakening, Vampire the Requiem, and Werewolf the Forsaken ©2014-2016 CCP hf and published by Onyx Path Publishing.%0aProduced by Jeff Vandenberg.

But we can’t have that, now, when there’s still so much work to do, can we? Just hold still, we’ll make sure they correct this error...  %0a%3c %0a%3c Not every scream in the ICU is caused by a painful disease wreaking havoc with a patient’s senses. Not every cry in the prison is an inmate demanding to be released or being unwilling to make peace with their situation. Not every wail in the orphanage is a young child simply wishing their parents were still around. Many times, in the darkest moments of the night, these calls are caused not by the situation of those dwelling inside, but by the monsters lurking in the institution’s shadows, the nightmares made manifest of those within. The Morotrophians. %0a%3c They are the doctor known to perform just a few too many surgeries, the bogeyman in the dark corners of the unkempt orphanage, and the brutal guard in the prison. Wherever there’s a group of people that nobody will pay attention to when claims of monsters amongst the staff or in the corners are made, it’s likely that one of the Monks has made their home there. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Background: %0a%3c %0a%3c While the first Monk’s sire is unknown, he himself has been recorded, his modern progeny usually knowing much about him, given the bloodline’s aptitude for record keeping and procedure. His name was Ludoldus, a young german monk that found himself unable to leave the confines of his monastery after being embraced as a Nosferatu, suffering bouts of fear and confusion whenever he left the property. %0a%3c Lonely an existence as that was, it wasn’t too long before he began to sire progeny of his own, using his connections from life to find them homes amongst other monasteries and abbeys when it became clear they couldn’t possibly all stay in the same place without drawing attention. Of course, this cycle quickly repeated, each one a little further away from the standard Ludoldus himself kept with regards to who he would feed on or experiment upon. What followed was a great purging of sorts, some say by God himself, while others claim it was simply a matter of overpopulation and recklessness, as the monks and nuns discovered what was responsible for the sudden deaths. Either way, nearly half the bloodline was killed, and it was in the aftermath that they began to settle in positions where those within wouldn’t be listened to by man or God alike; asylums. %0a%3c It’s had its ups and downs since then, but in modern times the bloodline can be found (in more conservative numbers) throughout civilized societies around the world. For more information on their history, see Bloodlines: The Hidden.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c :Requirements:  Morotrophians need to be Nosferatu, and in general must also be free of any persistent mental conditions of their own before their bloodline can properly be activated.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Clan: Nosferatu%0a%3c %0a%3c :Interactions with the Danse: The Morotrophians have no official organization amongst themselves, since so few of them are ever in the same area, and especially not the same building (which few ever wish to leave). They do tend to have reliable lines of communication to others of their kind, however, the better to manipulate the setup of institutions that go up further than the local asylum; using each others’ connections as a group to manipulate the State Department, for instance.%0a%3c %0a%3c Whether amongst their own kind or amongst Kindred in general, the Monks tend to keep extensive record of debts owed, favors paid, and assistance rendered both by and for others, and are well known for causing trouble for those that welch on a debt. While they rarely leave their homes to do this themselves, other Monks or Kindred that refuse to repay their favors may find themselves hassled by government agencies or news crews that pay a little too much scrutiny to the offending Kindred, often causing no end of problems for them, even occasionally driving them out of their previously safe haven. %0a%3c %0a%3c With regards to wider Kindred society, those that align themselves with a covenant often find themselves amongst the Invictus, their tendency for rules, order, oaths, and debt tracking innately suiting their talents. Some others that still haunt religious organizations or cults find that the Lancea et Sanctum calls to them, allowing them to play the monster in the dark that punishes the sinful and tests the righteous. Finally, some few join the Ordo Dracul, taking command of an institution that also happens to be a Wyrm’s Nest, often being willing to watch over even those said to be the most dangerous.%0a%3c %0a%3c Though they may deal with their covenant, very few take positions of power amongst Kindred as a whole, rarely participating in the politics of other vampires unless the rulings involved would affect their own institution. In such a case, they’ll often suddenly call upon the large number of small favors many of them have collected, working to be sure their hunting grounds go unharmed. The one exception to this is the occasional Keeper of Elysium; none can run a proper court quite like one of the Monks.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c :Nickname: Monks%0a%3c %0a%3c :Bloodline Bane: The mind of a Morotrophian works best when steeped in procedures, rules, guidelines, and boundaries, whether physical, social, or simply well known and understood. In fact, when outside of an institution (see Institutionalize, below) or another situation that meets these prerequisites, their mind has trouble working at all; they suffer the Confused condition until they’ve spent at least a half hour clearing their mind in an appropriate institution (and gain no beat for its resolution). Usually, this bane only applies if some sort of social or mental task needs to be accomplished there; simply walking down the street won’t cause them any particular problem.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c :Bloodline Disciplines: Nightmare, Obfuscate, Vigor, Dominate%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Bloodline Gift: Institutionalize, Authority, and Operation%0a%3c %0a%3c :Description: Despite being stuck within his monastery, Ludoldus found he was able to form a greater connection to it than has ever been seen before amongst Kindred, finding that the secrets of the building itself and those of the people within it seemed to be almost intuitively understood by him. This bloodline gift of the Morotrophians, now called Institutionalize, allows both understanding and control of an institution or similar location. Rules can be made to be followed, the motivations of those supposedly in charge can be understood, and the building seems to just run smoother for the Monk. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are conditions with regards to what sorts of institutions, buildings, and gathering places can be affected by their Gift. Generally, most of the following conditions must be met:%0a%3c *It must be a geographical location with easily discernable or at least commonly known boundaries, and must have mandatory attendance of some kind, whether for members of a cult, a prison’s population, or a hospital simply requiring that patients stay for observation and that schedules its staff.%0a%3c *It must contain some sort of social group or organization that has rules for the ways certain individuals are meant to behave, which can include everything from an orphanage having a curfew for the children, to the Laws of Elysium applying to Kindred within, to the separation between employees and guests at an office. %0a%3c *Some group within must usually concede some form of control over their life or legal rights. This can include mental patients having no control over their daily schedule and treatment, to developers for a company signing their copyright claims away.%0a%3c %0a%3c In addition, most buildings that are represented by a merit (Safe Place, for instance, and especially Havens) or that are part of a supernatural society (even if it doesn’t quite follow the rules above) can also be affected by this Gift. %0a%3c When working with such a location, the Monk then gains a number of capabilities, described as Aspects of their gift. The Aspects are Examination, Authority, and Operation, which are each merits rated at one to five dots. Morotrophians start with one dot in each, and may purchase further dots of the Aspect merits as normal.%0a%3c The Kindred’s level of any Aspect  always controls either the number of individuals affected or the size of the location influenced, in addition to what’s listed under the effects of each Aspect.%0a%3c %0a%3c •: A single individual, very small room (a closet, for instance), or similar sized space.%0a%3c %0a%3c ••: A few (up to 5) related individuals of the same type (All are guards, all are inmates, all are patients, etc), or a single regular sized room (A patient’s room would apply, for instance, but not a cafeteria).%0a%3c %0a%3c •••: A small group (up to 20 people) of related individuals of the same type , a few (up to 5) unrelated individuals in the same area (a guard and the two inmates nearby), a larger room (a waiting room, for instance), or a few related rooms (up to 5 prison cells, for instance).%0a%3c %0a%3c ••••: A much larger group of related individuals (up to 50 targets of the same type), a small group of unrelated individuals (up to 20 people of any sort that match the Gift’s criteria), a very large room or similar sized location (an ICU, a playground), or a large number of related rooms (all bunks on the first floor).  %0a%3c %0a%3c ••••• The entirety of a building and the grounds surrounding it, or all of the people within the area.%0a%3c %0a%3c Unless otherwise stated, any Aspect use that isn’t instantaneous lasts for a scene. %0a%3c %0a%3c Cost: All Aspects cost one Vitae per dot level used, although the first time each one is used in a scene, this is lowered by one, to a minimum of zero.%0a%3c %0a%3c *Examination%0a%3c %0a%3c Using the Examine Aspect of Institutionalize reveals secrets about both mortal and location alike, the exact information revealed listed below. The roll to discern this information is Wits + Examination + Blood Potency - group/location size (per rating, above), with an additional penalty equal to the highest Composure amongst the targets in the case of a group. In the case of a Clash of Wills being needed, Wits + Blood Potency is rolled.%0a%3c %0a%3c •: The Morotorphian can discern the social dynamics of a group observed, gaining the ability to ask one question about that interplay per success rolled. Alternatively, he may ask one piece of information per success rolled about the location studied itself. In both cases, this must be purely mundane information, and only covers the specific emotions or physical facts themselves, not the reasons behind it. %0a%3c Example: The Monk’s player might study a group of prisoners sitting together, and ask who is seen as the most dangerous amongst them. He’d learn who it was, but not WHY he’s considered the most dangerous. Alternatively, he might ask which piece of machinery in a room breaks down the most often, but he would have no idea what causes it to fail.%0a%3c %0a%3c ••: The monk becomes able to dig a little deeper. He can learn reasons behind mundane questions asked, in general terms. These do count as additional ‘questions’, however, so further successes must be spent or the power used again. Alternatively, he can now learn supernaturally-oriented information; someone acting a certain way because of a use of Majesty, for instance, or a location acting as a Shadow Gate when certain conditions are  met. These still require the proper questions, of course.%0a%3c Example: In the above example, a success might be used to learn that the most dangerous of the inmates is viewed that way because he spent several months in solitary after breaking a guy’s arm. Or he may learn that the machinery breaks down because the janitor keeps sabotaging it out of anger against those in charge.   %0a%3c %0a%3c •••: At this level, the Morotrophian becomes better able to make sense of the supernatural information as well, learning the implications behind it, and perhaps even a bit about supernatural society, if related to the institution it’s being used at. Similarly, locations give up why their supernatural aspects exist as they do, such as who or what caused them. As above, this requires additional successes.%0a%3c Example: A success is spent to learn that the cute nurse is actually a Werewolf, while another tells him that a small group of others respect her because of this. Another success could be then spent to learn she’s a leader of the pack, and further questioning might reveal she’s a Cahalith, which is fairly typical for an alpha.%0a%3c %0a%3c ••••: The vampire moves beyond asking questions and becomes able to project his senses. If targeting individuals, the Kindred becomes able to share the senses of any individual within the targeted group, though can only do so to one at a time. If targeting an area, he can project his senses anywhere within it, as if viewing from behind a glass wall. At this level, this ability does not allow for a Clash of Wills; the perception is purely mundane (unless a targeted individual has a power that reveals supernatural information in use).%0a%3c %0a%3c •••••: As with the previous rating, the senses of a group or view of a location can be provided, but it’s more far reaching. The Kindred may simultaneously perceive from and understand the sensory input of a number of individuals or spots within the location equal to his Blood Potency. In addition, this perception allows him to see through illusions and similar trickery, allowing a Clash of Wills versus any power that alters perception or conceals something perceptible.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c *Authority%0a%3c %0a%3c The Aspect of Authority is what gives the Morotrophians their reputation for being able to run a well oiled machine, or at least, it certainly helps them to reinforce that viewpoint. Authority is used to make sure rules and procedure are followed. To utilize Authority, Manipulation + Authority + Blood Potency - size is rolled. Individuals may contest this with Resolve + Blood Potency. Any Clash of Wills resulting uses Manipulation + Blood Potency.%0a%3c %0a%3c •: At the basic level, a Morotrophian can stop targeted people from doing one specific, named thing that’s against the listed, established rules, though he cannot then make him do the correct thing in turn. For instance, he could stop an orphan from running away, but could not make the child then go to their room and fall asleep despite it being lights out, if he’s already outside. It also cannot cause inaction that would lead to harm coming to the target, however minor. When targeting a location, this makes sure it continues to run properly for the scene; machines won’t break down, locked doors won’t fail, and the power will remain constant. Any attempt to make it do otherwise suffers a penalty equal to the successes rolled, if mundane, and causes a Clash of Wills if supernatural. %0a%3c %0a%3c ••: More advanced levels of Authority allow the Morotrophian to make a given individual or group do as the rules say they should. A nurse that’s avoiding treating a patient she dislikes, for instance, might be forced to do her rounds and treat them as normal. In the case of a location, it not only keeps things running properly, but can make sure that proper procedures and rules, including who can access it, are followed by anyone that might interact with it, rather than needing to target those people individually. Someone attempting to do something against that area’s rules or go somewhere in the area that they’re not supposed to must roll Resolve + Blood Potency as if they themselves were targeted, and beat the successes rolled by the Morotrophian. In both cases, these must still follow already established rules and guidelines.%0a%3c %0a%3c •••: The Morotrophian learns to work within the spirit of the rules, or rather, the rules as he interprets them. He may do anything the first or second level allows, but may work within the spirit of the rules, even if the letter of the existing procedures does not prevent what’s being done. It’s ultimately a Storyteller call what does or does not follow the spirit of the institution’s guidelines.%0a%3c %0a%3c ••••: At this level, the Morotrophian not only interprets the rules, but creates them. He may use the first or second level of this Aspect with regards to a new rule created by him, by first writing it or otherwise placing it somewhere where it’d be seen or heard by those that should follow it. This includes anything from a “Do not enter” sign on a location he doesn’t want disturbed, to scrawling something on a sign that lists the rules for a swimming pool, or even making an announcement about it before activating the power. %0a%3c %0a%3c •••••: The ultimate extension of the Monk’s Authority comes when he not only can create new rules and make sure they’re followed, but when he can seem to retroactively put them in place. By using this level, the Monk creates a rule, as above, but in addition to it appearing where he puts it, circumstances come together to make sure the rule is actually entered into the books, or wherever such rules are usually kept. Any individuals in the area act as if this is entirely normal, though powers that discern memory alteration or mind affecting abilities can detect this, and potentially undo it with a Clash of Wills as normal. %0a%3c %0a%3c *Operation%0a%3c %0a%3c While Authority works to make sure rules and procedures are followed, Operation is used to more directly control the day to day operation of the location, or even to take control of the area itself. Stamina + Operation + Blood Potency - size is rolled to active it, contested by Composure + Blood Potency if appropriate. A Clash of Wills, if needed, uses Stamina + Blood Potency. In any case where a dice pool might be needed to perform an action reliably when controlling a location’s operation, use the Kindred’s Intelligence + Wits as their base dice pool.%0a%3c %0a%3c •: At this level, a brief moment of control over the location is taken, to perform one simple physical task the location or area is built for. For instance, the lights could be flicked off or on, a machine could be activated, or an alarm tripped despite nobody being present. Individuals targeted can have an idea put in their mind as to something that needs to be done (for instance, “That IV needs to be changed”), but it isn’t enforced.%0a%3c %0a%3c ••: More complex operation of a single aspect of an area can be controlled. With concentration (roll Resolve + Composure if he tries to do anything else, or gets distracted, or the effect ends), the Kindred could control what a camera sees, masking the reality of it, for instance, or could cause an industrial assembly line to activate and go through the whole process of manufacturing an object. Individuals targeted feel an urge to perform a task placed in their mind (that relates to the operation of the institution), and will do so as soon as they reasonably can if they fail to resist. In either case, this can last up to five minutes per success rolled.%0a%3c %0a%3c •••: Continuous control, that lasts an entire scene (or a half hour per success, if specific times are needed), can be provided at this level, which works identically to the second, but allows for the longer timespan. He must still concentrate on what he’s doing at this point.%0a%3c %0a%3c ••••: With the fourth level, the Morotrophian becomes able to more reflexively control the institution. He may perform any actions that the second (and third) level of Operation allows for without needing continual concentration, allowing him to take other actions or be distracted without interrupting what he’s doing.%0a%3c %0a%3c •••••: The Kindred gains the ability to go into a trance, at this level, to more directly take control of an area, as if an extension of himself. His body goes into a state similar to Torpor for the duration, and he gains control of every physical aspect of the location targeted, able to do anything from opening and closing a door as easily as he could move his hand, to speaking through the loudspeakers as easily as he could talk normally. His senses are limited to what might normally be within the building, such as seeing through cameras or listening through microphones, unless he also uses Examine’s fourth or fifth dot after activating this Aspect. At any point, he may return to his body at will, ending the Aspect and waking up, but he has no sense of his own body otherwise unless he takes damage. When targeting individuals with this level, it works the same as the fourth, but he may continually change the task to be completed whenever it gets completed, for the duration.%0a

Rather, the Anvari have turned to the use of opium and other narcotics to try to recapture their dead emotions. Over the centuries, the Anvari have come to view narcotics not only as a way to ease the torments of unlife, but as a way to ascend to a higher state.  The bloodline also relies on the addictive effects of narcotics to tie others to its members. Building herds of pliant kine is not only acceptable to the Anvari, but%0a%3c necessary. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Background: %0a%3c %0a%3c The Anvari claim to be one of the oldest bloodlines walking tonight.  According to their legends, their founder was Sepehr Anvari, an opium-dealer in the last years of the Persian Empire. %0a%3c %0a%3c :Requirements: What does it take to get into this bloodline?%0a%3c %0a%3c :Clan:  Daeva%0a%3c %0a%3c :Interactions with the Danse: Other Kindred tend to view the Anvari with distaste at best, and as a constant threat to exposure among mortals at worst. The rest of the Daeva view Pushers as substandard members of the clan who are%0a%3c incapable of seducing prey through beauty and talent alone. More Anvari are drawn to the Circle of the Crone than any other covenant.  The myths of Sumeria and Persia both have a strong female presence, leading many of the bloodline —particularly its elders — to be comfortable with the Acolytes’ general philosophy.  Furthermore, as some rituals of the old ways employ psychotropic substances, the Anvari are able to barter influence readily among the cultists. The Carthians are probably the most common choice for young Anvari, if for no other reason than members are slightly less hidebound in their viewpoints than more staid covenants. The Invictus enjoys its share of Pushers as well, whether they are established elders with a secure power base or up-and-coming dealers building fortunes in the drug trade. The Ordo Draculmay interest the occasional Anvari who seeks to escape the Curse or addiction through covenant strictures,but by and large its rites and practices require more self-discipline than most Pushers are willing to devote. It is the rare Anvari indeed who heeds the call of the Lancea Sanctum, as the very nature of the%0a%3c bloodline’s relationship with narcotics is offensive to many orthodox followers of that group.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Nickname: Pushers%0a%3c %0a%3c :Bloodline Bane: Anvari have become reliant upon the narcotics that they’re so closely tied to. When feeding upon mortals that have no opiates or opium-derived drugs in their system, they must spend a point of willpower, as if feeding from blood unsuitable for their blood potency rating. This does stack with that requirement, in the case of an elder, however, requiring two points of willpower to be spent (this breaks the normal rule allowing only one willpower per action). In addition, they are susceptible to becoming addicted to those same substances when ingested through the blood of those individuals, using the normal system for addiction. %0a%3c %0a%3c :Bloodline Disciplines: Auspex, Celerity, Majesty, Resilience%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Bloodline Gift: Nepenthe%0a%3c %0a%3c :Description: Nepenthe is the capability of the Anvari to sense, control, and emulate the effects of narcotics, especially opiates. Their bloodline gift is what has helped them to garner the nickname of Pushers, and helps them both feed and manipulate their herd. %0a%3c The gift is represented by a series of Devotions, though all Anvari start off with Fragrance of Hal’gil as an innate capability. %0a%3c %0a%3c *Fragrance of Hal’gil: The Anvari becomes able to sense the presence of narcotics, both in raw form and within the blood of living beings, the same way they’re able to sense blood, using their Kindred Senses, with the extent dependent on Blood Potency as normal. They might be able to smell opium-laden blood (and can tell the difference between it and ‘clean’ blood), or hear the languid heartbeat of someone under the influence of narcotics. They can tell the difference between opiates and other narcotics, as well as between pure drugs, cut drugs, and outright fakes by sight, even if it would be just about impossible to tell normally without using it.%0a%3c %0a%3c Inflict the Empty Soul (Majesty ••, Resilience •): With an instant action and one Vitae, the Kindred may roll Manipulation + Medicine + Majesty, versus the target’s Stamina + Blood Potency (if unwilling). If they gain the most successes (or at least one if uncontested), they can remove the effects of any narcotic from a target, which can include themself, although this does nothing to alleviate addiction, and in fact repeated usage may cause the Deprived condition in someone with the Addicted condition relating to narcotics. However, this can be a good way to punish an addict or to regain one’s senses in an emergency.%0a%3c %0a%3c This devotion costs 2 Experiences to learn.%0a%3c %0a%3c *Crave the Caress (Majesty •••): The Kindred creates an incredible urge for a chosen drug in a target, by spending 1 Vitae and rolling Manipulation + Persuasion + Majesty versus the target’s Composure + Blood Potency. If the Anvari rolls more successes, the target gains the Addicted and Deprived condition with regards to the drug, which will resolve naturally when the night ends. Providing the drug allows the Kindred to force a door during social maneuvering, counting as hard leverage that forced a breaking point (even if it didn’t), but not requiring any roll. %0a%3c %0a%3c This devotion costs 2 Experiences to learn.%0a%3c %0a%3c *Blessed Kiss of Hal’gil (Majesty •••• or Auspex ••••, Resilience ••): This devotion allows the Anvari to create the sensation of taking a narcotic within a subject, dulling pain, relaxing them, and perhaps worsening addictions. The Kindred spends 1 Vitae and rolls Presence + Medicine + Majesty or Auspex against the target’s Stamina + Blood Potency. If they roll more successes, the subject is affected as if by a narcotic with a potency/toxicity equal to the Kindred’s dots in Majesty or Auspex (whichever is higher). The Kindred decides if it works normally or as if through an overdose. In the former case, all wound penalties are removed for the next scene,  although they also take a -3 penalty to all physical dice pools for the same amount of time, and continued use of this devotion may cause the Addiction condition in a target. However, it will also end the Deprived condition with regards to narcotics. If treated as an overdose, the target rolls to avoid damage immediately, and then once per hour for a number of hours equal to six minus their stamina. %0a%3c %0a%3c This devotion costs 3 Experiences to learn.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25''Name of Bloodline here'' %0a%3c %0a%3c Fill out the introduction with what the bloodline is about and their goals and driving force.

Even happiness can be bought and sold, including my own.”''%0a%3c %0a%3c The Pearl Satraps of the Spring Court believe that their happiness is paramount above all things.  Not satisfied with mere contentment, the Satraps seek bliss whenever possible.  Bliss, however, is rarely easy to come by, and never free.  One always finds a cost associated, and the Pearl Satraps have chosen not only to accept that cost but to embrace it.%0a%3c %0a%3c All things are up for purchase, sale or trade. That is the single overriding principle of the Satrapy of Pearls. But it’s not just about cars, real estate, old books or new technology. They embrace such material wealth, absolutely.

The Satrapy’s interest goes far deeper.%0a%3c %0a%3c And that cuts to the heart of the matter: everything is for sale, not just objects and luxuries. Sex, love, hate, betrayal, sorrow… all lie waiting on the auction block, but only the Pearl Satraps believe themselves wise enough to %0a%3c see it and take advantage of it. Commerce extends beyond selling  land  or  buying  somebody’s  horse.  A  pretty  girl’s heart is for sale, always, but it takes more than money to get it (usually, at least). And every girl is different, her heart demanding a different price from different suitors. One requires a ready kindness, another asks for casual abuse. Her tears, too, are for up sale for those who know the costs. Her tears, scars, memories, desires — all available to those willing to see the value and pay the price. They can be bottled. They can be sold.%0a%3c %0a%3c And so, this is what the Pearl Satraps do. On one hand, they please themselves above all others. They go out in the world and what they see, they want, and what they want, they purchase. It’s a mad game to serve their vanity, but what else does one have if one is without the joy of conceit? One Satrap sees a silver locket around a woman’s neck, and that  locket  holds  the  picture  of  her  dearly  departed  husband. Oh, but the Satrap wants it, and the woman assures him that she’ll never give it up. But she will. Maybe money will do the trick (people love money more than they’d care to admit, the Satraps say).  If not that, then something else.  The return of a lost child?  A threat against her dear friend?  Revenge against a cruel boss?  She'll give the locket up when the Satrap sounds the right price.  And he'll take it only when she's conceded to that price; no Satrap will accept something without first paying the proper cost.  Nor will he ever steal, for thievery is anathema to this noble order.  Nothing is free.  To act as if it is means a willful refutation of those principles the Satrapy hold dear.%0a%3c %0a%3c It’s not just about one’s own happiness, though. Many Pearl Satraps place themselves as procurators for others, be they changelings, mortals or any of the odd strangers that skulk  around  the edges of the freehold.  Everybody knows that if you need something bad enough, the Satrapy of Pearls can get it for you. A draught of a child’s blood? The heel from the left shoe of the Winter Court Queen? A simple apology whispered in one’s ear beneath the last full moon of Autumn?  Of course.  What’s desired can be purchased, the Satraps assure. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Prerequisites%0a%3c %0a%3c Wyrd 3, Persuasion 3, Spring Court Mantle 2%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Titles%0a%3c %0a%3c Satraps, Pearl Satraps%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Joining%0a%3c %0a%3c One must belong to the Spring Court to join the Satrapy of Pearls. The noble order considers the other Courts to have missed the point, thus eschewing the potential of life and the magic that accompanies it. Life is meant to be enjoyed, and if one cannot understand that most basic of concepts, then one does not deserve membership of such noble standing.%0a%3c %0a%3c One must still prove oneself worthy of the Satrapy of Pearls, however. The proof demanded is simple enough to understand, but often difficult to procure. One must first gain audience with a Pearl Satrap, which isn’t difficult as most are glad for the conversation (and the possibility of commerce). In asking for acceptance into the Satrapy, one only needs the say-so from a single other Satrap. In obtaining that say-so, however, the changeling must accept a challenge of commerce as determined by the Satrap. The Satrap will demand that the changeling acquire something from someone: a love letter, a favorite brooch, an embarrassing memory, whatever. In obtaining this, the changeling cannot steal or inveigle it freely. It must be acquired by finding a price and paying that price — which is what the Satraps do every day. If the changeling is incapable of playing that game and comprehending the give-and-take of universal commerce, then she doesn’t belong among the Pearl Satraps.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Mein%0a%3c %0a%3c Pearl Satraps dress well as an emblem to project their luxury.  The Satrapy has  no shared standard for style, and so one changeling might prefer the modern trappings of haute couture, while another might traipse about in a lavish (even gaudy) silken robe once worn by some ancient Persian governess. Ostentatious displays, while rarely tasteful, work to affirm a Satrap’s commitment to wealth of some kind.%0a%3c %0a%3c A Satrap’s mien shifts slightly, too. Mostly, it simply reflects impeccable grooming: not a hair out of place, perfect nails, heavenly skin. The other change to a Satrap’s mien  happens to his eyes: they become pearlescent, as if they are not eyes at all but perfect pearls thrust into the sockets. It’s difficult to tell when a Satrap is looking at you, as his pupils are lost in a sea of opaline white. As a Satrap’s Wyrd increases, however, the mortal world begins to feel it. Those with Greed as a Vice have trouble resisting their own avarice, overtaken by a palpable hunger as the Satrap passes by. Mortals may believe that the changeling suffers from some kind of cataract, as well, seeing past  the  human  guise  and  peering into those unnerving eyes.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Background%0a%3c %0a%3c It’s  easy  to  assume that those who join the Satrapy of  Pearls  were  always  narcissistic  power-mongers believing themselves to be the cream that floats so easily to the top. Certainly this is true for some, but not for the bulk of the order. No, most Pearl Satraps have had to claw their way up from the bottom, and that’s how the Satrapy prefers it. Those who have been poor, destitute or otherwise outcast are the ones who know the true hunger necessary to wear the seeming of the Satraps. And, by proxy, those who know the hunger can therefore experience the true joy of feeding that hunger. It’s not just about searching out the mad joie de vivre that comes with  the  purchase  of  10  favors  from  nine women or about the sale of one old man’s lifelong dreams, but it’s about experiencing it wholly. It’s about appreciating it.%0a%3c %0a%3c Some  Satraps  even  seek  out  those who lurk at the bottom of the food chain and offer a casual reminder that it merely takes the will to pull oneself out of the gutter and climb the ladder that leads to the stars. They don’t offer any other help beyond those few words, because a future Satrap must claw his own way up from the underbelly.%0a%3c %0a%3c Worth noting, too, is that not all Satraps end up wealthy.  Yes most do, as it's their bread and butter (and a symbol of status within the order). But a Satrap can just as easily be a filthy beggar in a back alley, glee-fully offering his strange services for a handful of coins or a curious bauble. More important than the status of wealth is evidence of one’s conquests in this world of makeshift commerce. Few Satraps care to live without luxury, though, and a truly destitute member of this order is quite rare. (There-fore, most possess Resources 2 at the bare minimum.)%0a%3c %0a%3c Obviously, what the Satraps do requires them to have a strong reliance on their Social Traits, with Presence and Manipulation usually being higher than average. Any Social Skill, with the exception of Animal Ken for the most part, requires attention; the Satraps can use any of these Skills to work out the parameters of a trade or purchase.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Organization%0a%3c %0a%3c The Satrapy cares little for formal organization. Its members can operate alone or together, it matters little. Provided they uphold the oath given to the other Pearl Satraps, then any sense of unity is thrown to the wind.%0a%3c %0a%3c Two exceptions to this laissez-faire attitude exist, both of which are events held annually by the Satrapy. Each event bookends the season of Spring. Within the first week of the season,  the  Pearl  Satraps  hold  what’s  formally  known  as the Opal Auction of the Springtide Pearl, but most know it simply as, “The Auction.” Every Satrap is expected to bring one or several treasures to the table and bid them off at a gala affair (catered to every strange taste, serviced by ensorcelled). The Auction represents a time to show off, as well as a time to demonstrate the Satrapy’s considerable skills at obtaining things people might want. It often leaves the changelings of the freehold talking for weeks. How did that Satrap secure a single night’s worth of boot-polishing and  floor-scrubbing  from  the  Winter  Court’s  second-in-command? Just what kind of creature waited within that blood-colored egg, twitching as it did on the silver platter? How does one keep grief in an oaken puzzle box?%0a%3c %0a%3c The second event is reserved only for the Satraps themselves. At the end of the season, the Pearl Satraps come together for a kind of brag session and show-and-tell, talking about all their successes and failures. Every Satrapy does it differently. One might rent a yacht and sit upon its deck, breathing in the smoldering narcotic fumes of the seeds of strange fruits brought from the Hedge. Others might relax in club chairs in an air-conditioned room or gather in some poor human’s penthouse suite (with the mortal bound up and made to witness the affair, his mind reeling with what he sees and hears).%0a%3c %0a%3c After these events, the Pearl Satraps might go the rest of the year without even talking to one another, though certainly there exists an informal network of back-scratching and info-giving. Remember, though, that each Pearl Satrap represents friendly competition for every other Pearl Satrap. He who has the most toys, relatively speaking, wins.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Concepts%0a%3c %0a%3c Acquisitions attorney, eccentric antiquarian, gleeful mammonite, high-price prostitute, Iago, procurer of pledges, snake-oil salesman, spider in the center of a web.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Privileges%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Avaricious Finesse'''- Buying and selling is everything to the Satraps. She can automatically add one success to any successful roll to buy or sell something. Additionally, she may spend a Glamour to add her Wyrd to Presence and Manipulation rolls for the rest of the scene. Also, the Satrap is able to judge the fair market value of any merchandise or service on sight, be it mundane or supernatural. Mundane attempts to force her into a bad deal, or to disguise the value of something automatically fail. Supernatural powers which would force her into a bad deal, or used to disguise the value of something, automatically cause a Clash of Wills (the Satrap using Wits+Wyrd).%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Rumors of the Satrapy%0a%3c %0a%3c * Somehow, the Satraps always have a small item from every Court's King or Queen except those of the Spring Court. The item is usually small — a single earring, a lucky coin, a knob from one of their dressers — but rumor has it that this small item gives the Satrap major power over the ruler. The Satraps must forge tokens from these items. %0a%3c *Every Satrap has a secret treasure trove somewhere in the city, usually just outside the freehold’s accepted borders. The boxes are usually fire-safe and locked with three different locks (usually padlocks). The Satrap buries the treasure trove or hides it. Each box is supposed to contain all manner of wonders and horrors. A Fairest from the next city over said she found a haunted money clip, a bullet in a jar tagged with a label that read ‘magic’ and a necklace made of seven severed fingers. After discovering it, she went missing three days later. %0a%3c *The Satraps know Contracts that nobody else knows, though stories suggest they made terrible bargains to get them. They know some every old and very strange Goblin Contracts, as well. Remember that the Satraps have their price. They’ll teach them, but the cost will be steep.%0a%3c %0a

The words I speak are naught but pleasant distractions and magicians' misdirection. Do this and you will begin to read the lines of power, governance, truth, lies, and glamour.”''%0a%3c %0a%3c Lies come naturally to humanity. It is an instinct children develop before they can even speak and they hone it while manipulating their parents. Lies are important. They can keep an individual out of trouble, advance a career, and tear down enemies when applied appropriately. The Principality of the Crooked Tongue are masters of the lie and its members are often social titans among their freehold and courts- expert liars and manipulators who can twist people around their fingers with ease. What each and every one of them realize is that truth is not in words but in deeds. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Principality is a secret society. Most members do not know precisely who the others of the Entitlement are as gatherings are an exercise in lies where individuals will go to extensive magical and mundane lengths to hide their identity. Princes and princesses are willing to work cross purpose in freehold and court matters but beneath the petty politics is a far more primal alliance dedicated to the fundamental principle of upholding the greater oaths that protect changeling society itself such as freehold bulwarks and the courts themselves. Without these, Huntsmen would run rampant and society itself would crumble. %0a%3c %0a%3c Changelings know how vital these institutions are, but it is often lost in the day to day pressures of courtly intrigue. The Principality uses every ounce of guile and social expertise to manipulate the courts and freeholds around them into upholding their responsibilities- and if they come out of the process with an incredible amount of wealth, a courtly title, and favors owed to them then all the better. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Prerequisites%0a%3c %0a%3c Wyrd 4, Subterfuge 4, Empathy 3 %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Titles%0a%3c %0a%3c Prince/ Princess%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Joining%0a%3c %0a%3c Every word a Princess of the Crooked Tongue speaks is false or misdirection, and those who join their ranks are changelings who can successfully read their motives through their lies or misdirect and defeat one of the Principality in a social contest. If a member finds a good prospect, they will extend a discrete invitation- not in lying words but by deed. The invitation plays out as a careful courtship extending a tentative offer for an alliance mixed with tests of integrity to make sure the prospective member will uphold the greater oaths. The prospective member may not even realize the potential outcome until she accepts an alliance with the Principality and is given the choice to swear to the order.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Mein%0a%3c %0a%3c The mien of a member of the Principality always contains some golden symbol of authority. The form can vary greatly but it it always something that the changeling considers a symbol of authority. Common forms include golden coronet, torc, a key or badge pinned to chest, or even a golden tattoo. Due to the secretive nature of the Entitlement, some members go to great lengths to hide or disguise the change to their mien.  %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Background%0a%3c %0a%3c Most members of the Principality are social powerhouses with their courts with a high Wits, Intelligence, and a focus on social traits. Many are incredibly influential before they ever join but the stereotype isn't always ring true. Some have never cared for power and instead focus their attention on the mortal world. They keep their ears open and gather intelligence. Some are simply pathological liars. No matter where they come from, Princes and Princesses all have a reason to lie. They have all learned from experience that even words that seem true can be twisted. Loopholes in pledges can be found, and words are merely a tool for manipulating those who aren't smart enough to read the underlying truth of a situation. They have been taken advantage of in some fashion and in order to never allow it to happen again, they armor themselves in lies of their own weaving. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Organization%0a%3c %0a%3c The Principality primarily gathers in cities where multiple freeholds stand side by side. In each city the Principality is ruled by a Grand Master, a title granted to the most experienced and cunning of their number. The Princes and Princesses beneath her report any machinations they come across that could put the greater oaths at risk and she may then make assignments across the Entitlement to take appropriate measures. %0a%3c %0a%3c Besides the Grand Master, members of the Entitlement generally do not know everyone else that is a member. Complete secrecy is impossible, of course, but it becomes a game within the Principality to see how many of their colleagues they can identify while remaining covert. Meetings are in person and other methods of communication are generally not trusted- they make it too easy to lie. %0a%3c %0a%3c :Fitting In:%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Concepts%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Privileges%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Tongue of Eyes and Lies'''- Upon joining the Entitlement, all Princes and Princesses gain the 8-again quality to Subterfuge rolls as well as the three-dot Aura Reading merit.

Laws declared by human or even changeling authorities have no sway over hobgoblins and oneiroi and yet there are still customs and natural laws- Mores that dictate what is acceptable and what is not. There are lines that most creatures instinctively hesitate to cross. Dreams are where mortals most often brush up against the fae world, and it’s here that the Justicars of Themis have drawn a line in the sand.  %0a%3c %0a%3c Justicars rarely view themselves as aristocrats. Most still think of themselves as common changelings who have stepped up to perform a particularly difficult and onerous duty. The Justicars cannot prevent every terrible deed that happens and so they focus their efforts on a minimum standard of behavior for those who dabble in oneiromancy. They do not consider the Mores to be law as that would imply they would need proper jurisdictional authority to enforce them. Mores run deeper in that and are born from a common instinct of what must not be. %0a%3c %0a%3c :'''The Mores''':%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Mixing Blood:''' Physical relations between an incubus and a mortal that result in the birth of a Cambion must not be. %0a%3c %0a%3c '''Mental Battery:''' Complete destruction, drastic or permanent mental alteration, or the enslavement of an innocent's mind must not be. %0a%3c %0a%3c '''Plague Bearing:''' Spreading Dream Poison must not be. %0a%3c %0a%3c '''Murder:''' Using dreams to murder mortals must not be. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Prerequisites%0a%3c %0a%3c Wyrd 2, Investigation 4 (additional for higher ranks, see below) %0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!!%25center%25''The Lost Pantheon''%0a> %0a> ''“Old myths, old gods, old heroes have never died.

Oftentimes the lowest ranking members Entitlement come across recruits when they travel in pursuit of a suspect and pass word of them up the chain of command. The Banner in charge of the regional office will then come pay the recruit a visit in their dreams and make the offer. The recruit may reject the offer at first and the Justicars will step back and watch for a year and a day. If the recruit is still considered worthy after that time they will arrange for word of a violation of the Mores to reach them. If the recruit acts on the information then the Justicars will make the offer a second time. If the offer is rejected again the process is repeated. Only after a third rejection will the Justicars leave the recruit in peace. %0a%3c %0a890,891d869%0a%3c Upon joining the Justicars of Themis, a changeling's eyes become a bright neon blue. As her Wyrd increases the blue grows out around her eyes, through the Justicar's veins. Those with high Wyrd find that their blood is completely neon blue and also becomes luminescent. %0a%3c %0a894,895d871%0a%3c There are many paths that can lead a changeling to join the Justicars of Themis. For some it is a matter of idealism and a way to protect mortals while others join because they've seen the damage that violating the Mores can cause firsthand. A rare few have even violated the Mores themselves in the past and join the Justicars as means of making amends. Members tend to be intelligent and highly skilled oneiromancers with the physical skills to survive the rigors of the Hedge as well as their enemies. %0a%3c %0a898,915c874,877%0a%3c The Justicars of Themis maintain a strict command structure across the globe though the bureaucracy of the organization is minimal and the vast majority of members never become involved in the upper ranks of the order. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Shields%0a%3c %0a%3c Justicars enter the Entitlement as a Shield and most never move beyond it. Changelings fulfilling this roll work in their hometown and freehold to protect the dreams of the mortals around them. They investigate any rumors of violations of the mores, hunt cambions, and sometimes try to help heal those whose dreams have been ravaged. Many also develop extensive networks of informants in the Hedge and keep an eye out for any potential new recruits.

The most common is for a Knight to take a promising prospect as her squire. The squire passes through at least a season of rigorous training and testing of her loyalty, passion, and will to succeed. When the squire's Lord-Knight deems her ready, she is presented to a quorum of her prospective peers. Because of the widespread nature of the Entitlement this process is just as likely to happen by video conference as it is to happen in person. The quorum presents a trial meant to stretch the squire to her physical, mental, and magical limits- and push her beyond them. Successfully completing each task on her own is not required, but having the humility to ask for help is. Asking for help too soon, however, is a sure way to fail. It is a careful balance to strike but the Tempest Knights cannot afford to coddle members. %0a%3c %0a%3c The second method of joining is exceptionally rare and some even consider it apocryphal. The modern Tempest Knights were founded by several Elementals and a lone Fairest who all felt a call within their souls. It spoke to the water, fire, ice, glass, and light within them and anxiously begged for their aid. They each answered the call and found each other in a large hollow where every element in it was perfectly balanced. It was under attack by hobgoblins attempting to claim it for their own. Together the founders called upon their elements and won the day. The founders claimed that the Entitlement had existed before, that in return for their aid, the elements had shown them the oath of the ancient Entitlement. Every now and then a new Tempest will answer a call for aid or appear at gatherings even though no one knows who they are. The few who claim they were tested and accepted into the Entitlement as the founders were are called Stormborn- though those who don't believe the stories will argue that the Stormborn were simply inducted by a quorum elsewhere in the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Mein%0a%3c %0a%3c Flickers of elements creep into a Tempests mien, whipping up stormlets through their hair and across their skin. In the presence of other Tempests their elements blend together. A Tempest with an affinity for ice meeting one bonded to water might produce a hail storm in miniature between their miens when in close proximity. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Background%0a%3c %0a%3c Tempest Knights are those who are forced by circumstance to see the advantages of a strong alliance. Each comes from power- social, physical, or mystical but all have acknowledged that their power alone is not enough. Many have lost someone precious that they were supposed to protect or suffered a serious defeat. They have been broken down in one fashion or another and sometimes it leaves scars in their psyche. Many Tempests are affected by persistent Conditions or are simply emotionally fragile. They are keenly aware of their own shortcomings even if they don’t allow it to show. Successful members of the Entitlement are generally well liked in their home courts and Entitlements as they are generous with their talents, and fearless when it comes to defending those that they care about. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Organization%0a%3c %0a%3c Formally, all Tempest Knights are equal. All may call for and expect aid to come but individuals answer to no one but themselves. There is no single Lord-Knight that rules over the others and dictates where they must go. In practice there is a range of influence and respect. The most influential are Free Knights. This is a title given to any who is not bound by oaths that could interfere with the work of the Entitlement. Free Knights spend the majority of their time traveling. They answer calls for aid all across the world, organize meetings of quorums, and train new squires. %0a%3c %0a%3c On the other end of the spectrum are the those who have refused to answer a call for aid when they could have. It’s the deepest sort of betrayal a Tempest can commit without leaving the Entitlement and those who regularly fail to contribute to the good of the Entitlement are slowly frozen out of society. If they call for help, it will arrive but likely too little and too late to make a difference.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Privileges%0a%3c %0a%3c :Description:%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Stormborn Champion''' - Tempests are unaffected by Environmental Tilts controlled by other members of the Tempest Knights and they add +1 per Tempest Knight present to their effective Wyrd when using any elemental Contract. This bonus includes the individual activating the contract and alone she gains +1 effective Wyrd.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Rumors of the Tempest Knights%0a%3c %0a%3c *One of the Founders of the Tempest Knights went mad and ran off back to Arcadia. She comes back every now and then, calling for aid. Anyone who answers the call is never seen again. Worse though is that sometimes she’ll come if a Tempest calls for help. Word is that a Tempest in Illapel, Chile asked for help against a loyalist who had sworn a vendetta. Every loyalist in the area disappeared but half the freehold was destroyed in the tsunami too. %0a%3c %0a%3c *The Stormborn are not actually changelings. They are elemental hobs that can mimic Changeling form. No one knows what they want, but they were never human and the Tempests are still bound to help them with whatever they ask.   %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25''The Lost Pantheon''%0a%3c %0a%3c ''“Old myths, old gods, old heroes have never died.

They are only sleeping at the bottom of our mind, waiting for our call.  We have need for them.  They represent the wisdom of our race: the old ways.”''%0a%3c %0a%3c At  the  dawn of  humanity,  powerful spirits  walked  the  borders between  the  earthly  and  the  supernatural. The eldest artworks of Neolithic times depict beings too fanciful to be man, beast, or any other wholly terrestrial thing. Perhaps these entities were the Others, their images captured in ochre and charcoal on the innermost walls of ancient caverns, but some Lost believe that these crude drawings are, instead, images of their own kind —  admired, feared,  and even worshipped by primitive mortals. They think back to a more primal and mysterious age, an age during which it seems that the otherworldly  walked  side-by-side  with  the  mundane, and a balance existed between gods and men. These changelings have resolved to be those very gods in a jaded modern world.%0a%3c %0a%3c This eldritch order is an old one; older, perhaps, than the very notion of “noble title,” and aligned with powers that predate such things as agriculture, walled settlements, and the written word. While many of the outsiders  that  know  of  the  Lost  Pantheon  doubt  its claim to such extreme antiquity, few deny the primordial energies that are harnessed within each changeling who takes up its banner. Of course, the feudal, almost pseudo-medieval society of the Lost does not necessarily react well to the emergence of one or more primitive would-be gods whose beliefs are in keeping with an epoch that knew nothing of civilization, let alone kings and queens, knights and barons. Friction often exists between the status quo and the fae of the Lost Pantheon, due to mutual unfamiliarity, if nothing else, though the raw power and faded Clarity (and often somewhat skewed morality inherent to both) common  to  changelings  sworn  to this  entitlement often makes their presence a matter of uncomfortable coexistence, rather than something  to  be  actively driven out.%0a%3c %0a%3c Beasts and Elementals are the seemings most called to the Lost Pantheon, though any changeling inclined toward a primal vision of the world and willing to draw power from that  vision (and those mortals that still subscribe to it, to one degree or another) can be drawn to this entitlement. In modern times, the mortals most commonly associated with these beliefs are practitioners of the so-called Old Ways, religious systems with roots  stretching  back  to  pre-civilization  archetypes that the changelings come to embody: Earth Mothers and Sun Fathers, Bear Women and Wolf Men, and other such atavistic icons. While the practices have %0a%3c changed,  their  foundations  remain,  echoing  down from  the  remotest  antiquity,  from  the  very  first  humans to recognize and acknowledge the existence of the supernatural world. Indeed, the so-called Ancients of the Lost Pantheon reflect an age when the distinction between the natural and the supernatural was a line so thin as to be invisible to all save the most cunning and discerning of holy men and wise women.%0a%3c %0a%3c Of course, these ideals descended down, through the ages, with rough-hewn divinities taking on sharper edges in the crucible of civilization. However, the fundamental aspects of their origins as the unfathomable gods of hunter-gatherers remained. And, so it is that some Ancients embody newer (though still quite ancient) concepts, drawn from such inspirations as Zeus, Gnowee, Thor, Agni, Punga, Coyolxauhqui, Nemain, Anubis, Coyote, Okuninushi, or other such deities, some of whom are venerated even  in modern times. Always, these Ancients are conscious of the primordial origins of the god-forms that they represent. Even more contemporary conceptions of such figures include Bloody Mary (a spirit of death), the Jersey Devil (a chimera), the phantom hitchhiker (who may be a guide to lead people back to the proper path, or a trickster to lead them astray), the chupacabra (a feral vampire), and the black dog (a reimagining of dogs’ traditional association with the Underworld). All of these sorts of divinities can eke out a place within the order, if they are but willing to accept their great station and to celebrate their godliness.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Prerequisites%0a%3c %0a%3c Wyrd  6+,  Mantle  (Any)  4,  Clarity 8+.  If Clarity drops below 8 the benefits end till clarity goes back to 8+.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Titles%0a%3c %0a%3c Ancient, Daemon, Totem, Goddess, Kami, Demigod, God, Loa, or  other such titles, as appropriate to the culture of the individual changeling.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Joining%0a%3c %0a%3c As informal as this  eldritch  order  is, it should be no surprise that there is no one single initiation into the Lost Pantheon. In fact, it’s rare that one Ancient initiates another. Most feel the call in their dreams, guided by the power of their own Wyrd onto a path that was first trod long ago. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Mein%0a%3c %0a%3c Ancients  of  the  Lost  Pantheon  often  eschew modern trappings, though this tendency is not %0a%3c universal and some few strike a balance between primordial  practices  and  contemporary  existence.  Far more  common,  however,  are  those  that  deal  almost exclusively with the mortals of their cults, and otherwise keep to the company of the Lost and other beings that dwell beyond the purview of the mundane world. Hedge-spun  garments  are  common  to  the  Ancients, as are clothes made from traditional materials, such as pelts and skins, plant fibers, and the like. Simple jewelry, tattoos and even scarification may adorn a given Ancient’s body, and many of them have great difficulty passing among modern mortals.%0a%3c %0a%3c No  single  specific  change  develops  in  the  mien of a member of the Lost Pantheon. Rather, such fae tend simply to become more of what they are, forsaking human appearance for that of their faerie selves: an Elemental of flame transforms into a living conflagration, while a pallid and vaguely necrotic Gravewight comes to look the part of a mummified lich-lord, and a vaguely equine Beast takes on hooves and a windswept mane and seems forever in motion, even when standing  still.  As  Wyrd  increases,  these  changes  become increasingly pronounced; particularly potent Ancients actually appear, in many ways, to outside observers like the earthly gods that they believe themselves to be. At the greatest heights of Wyrd, such changelings begin to bend the manifestations of their Mantles, compelling even the blessings of the seasons to conform to  their  “godly  attributes.”  Thus,  a  Winter  Darkling whose divine aspect is one of hidden places might find a  frozen  fog  envelops  her  at  all  times,  or  a  Summer Ogre embodying primal hunger might manifest licking  flames  within  his  mouth  that  occasionally  drop embers to consume random small flammable objects, such as papers, dry leaves, and the like.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Background%0a%3c %0a%3c Pinning down a “type” of changeling drawn to the Lost Pantheon is difficult, at best. Some come to the entitlement out of a sense of arrogance, to be sure, though many do not. Some grasp for anything to help them with fading Clarity, while others feel, deep down, that they truly are  divine  creatures;  or,  at  least, those  things  worshipped  as  divine by  primitive  humanity.  The  reasons are  many,  and  any  given  would-be mentor might have wildly  different  standards  regarding a prospective student than any other Ancient. The only commonality between those entitled  is  that  they  feel  called  to the  Lost  Pantheon’s  raw,  elemental power — the sense of being something far more than mortal, both for good and for ill.%0a%3c %0a%3c Potent  Wyrd  and  strong Mantles  certainly  play  into  the transformations  of  perception necessary to accept entitlement as an Ancient, but it goes deeper  than  that.  Changelings from  more  traditional,  superstitious, or mystical backgrounds tend to be likelier to embrace the way of the Lost Pantheon, as do those whose human memories and ideals were almost completely scoured away by especial cruel Durances. Perhaps most important to note is  the  fact  that  prospective  Ancients are not  fleeing from their scarred and mutilated humanity; they sincerely believe that they are not human anymore — that Arcadia has already destroyed anything in them that was mortal and replaced it with a wonderful, terrible power of godly origin. Even the most humble Ancient (and they are few) sincerely cleaves to the notion that she is a god clothed in flesh and most implicitly believe so, whether or not they could adequately articulate the notion, even before being accepted into the Lost Pantheon.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Organization%0a%3c %0a%3c The  Lost  Pantheon has little in the way of organization. Just as the most ancient divine powers  venerated  by  humanity had little  in  the  way  of  formalized  relationships, so, too, do most Ancients forsake a rigid hierarchy or other such linear interconnection. Instead, members of the Lost Pantheon often deal with one another as their respective natures demand: an  ocean  father may forever rage at an earth  mother, but  feel a kinship toward a moon goddess, or hold  a  storm  god  to  be  a brother. Ancients need not mentor those who embody godforms similar to their own and may even entitle those  with  aspects  hostile  to  their own, as divinity is often intemperate  and  requires  conflict.  Thus, any attempt to categorize the interactions between  Ancients  is more often than not doomed to futility.%0a%3c %0a%3c In places in which two or more Ancients come together (rare, indeed, in modern times), they tend to organize into a sort of “divine family,” arranged according to their godly archetypes. This may involve friendship, alliance, mutual respect, polite avoidance, simmering dislike, outright enmity, or any combination of the above. Individual personalities do not figure into their relationships quite so much as the requirements of their more primal attributes. A primal hunter and an aspect of a prey animal, for example, may,  as  people  and  as  changelings,  have compatible personalities and be thoroughly capable of coexisting as friends but, as Ancient of the Lost Pantheon, they are opposites in the same cycle of life and death, and their divine characteristics demand distance between them. There need not be antagonism between them — as the hunter and the hunted belong to a single natural  process  —  but  close  friendship  cannot  grow between them, as they are divided from one another by their appointed roles.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c :Fitting In:%0a%3c %0a%3c ''Finding a way to blend back into mortal society is a fundamental part of the story of Changeling: The Lost. How, then, do the Ancients of the Lost Pantheon embody this theme? After all, they seem to spend most of their time actively seeking out and embracing the supernatural aspects of the world, while blatantly denying their former mortality, and they don’t — on the surface — appear to have any interest in rebuilding their connections to humanity. But that’s just the thing; the goals and motivations of the Lost Pantheon are in many crucial ways the same as those of any changeling, just realized in a significantly different way.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Ancients do work to build a tie to mortals — a distorted and disturbing sort of tie, but a tie, nonetheless. The fact of the matter is that, like all fae, those of the Lost Pantheon are damaged in spirit, with scars that mar their souls and make them unlike the people all around them. Forced to exist a half-step apart from the life that they once possessed, the Ancients strive to be something that hurts less, something that doesn’t remind them so much of what has been taken from them, and they do so by becoming important to the mortals who venerate them. Like the good cop who returns from Arcadia and becomes a violent vigilante, or the psychiatrist whose Durance transforms her into a skilled oneiromancer, the changelings who turn to the Lost Pantheon cobble together a new self out of what they can recall from before the Thorns, the hurts that were done to them by the Gentry, and the shreds of a life that they can pick up after stumbling out of the Hedge.''%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Concepts%0a%3c %0a%3c Cult leader, reincarnated god, mystical transhumanist, incarnated dream, mad prophet, borderline solipsist, would-be True Fae.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Privileges%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Primordial Incarnation (•••••)'''- The powers of the Lost Pantheon reveal the path of its members’ supposed “divine transformation” into the entities venerated by humanity in remotest antiquity. Forsaking mortal perspective is easier to an ancient and to embrace the wyrd instead is to embrace their truest nature.  Upon embracing the wyrd the ancient is treated as having a wyrd of two higher for the purposes of dice they can add per turn.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Quintessence and Ambrosia (•••••)''' - Most Ancient’s begin to experience an existence that is filled with the gentle whispers of their worshippers or those who worship the idea of them.  It’s intrinsic to an Ancient as they take on the role of the old gods from long ago.  They form a sort of painless melody within the glamour saturated essence of their soul, a familiar, constant hum that the god feels somewhat in the way someone would feel a song stuck in the back of her mind.  These small offerings offer the Ancient a chance to harvest once a day even when alone.  When in the presence of their followers a harvest grants one extra glamour.%0a%3c %0a%3c Most of the time, though, an Ancient won’t recognize a prayer’s source.  The voice will be lost in the sea of infinite notes playing out the prayer song.  With concentration (and the expenditure of a willpower point), a god can sometimes listen closely to pick out a single prayer, especially if the practitioner is desperate or passionate.  If one voice rises above the rest, an exceptionally successful prayer, the Ancient can’t help but notice the request.  Such prayers are loud and clear enough that the Ancient can distinguish the petitioner’s general wishes.  Whether the Ancient choses to answer or not is ultimately up to them.  Gods can be fickle things but magic to appear suddenly before the practitioner is something beyond the scope of initiation.  However, hearing this prayer counts as a sympathetic connection to the practitioner and if the Ancient is capable of it they can target them with magic.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c '''Terrestrial Deity (•••••)''' -  Lastly the Ancient’s of the Lost Pantheon stand firm against the insane influence of the others. What is a god without their worshippers?  The Gentry seek out the faithful, the creative, the masterful, and the unique. The compassionate among the Ancient feel a strong sense of duty in protecting their followers while the pragmatic look at those soft voices under threat of the Gentry as just another number.  The Ancient gains the connected condition with their followers once per chapter and gains a +3 bonus to defy, attack, of defend against the Gentry, their powers, or their minions.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Rumors of the Ancients%0a%3c %0a%3c The Lost Pantheon is an object of awe and dread to many of the changelings that know of its existence. Given the potent Wyrd and Mantles with which its members must be favored, it is easy to see the Ancients as the demigods that they believe themselves to be, and the rumors that surround the entitlement thus tend to reflect the raw power with which the Lost Pantheon is blessed. Conversely, fae can be jealous of the mystic might of the Lost Pantheon and terrified of its inhuman nature, and so fearful gossip also circulates with regard to this eldritch order and its membership.%0a%3c %0a%3c *The Ancients of the Lost Pantheon eventually become True Fae, themselves, when all of their Clarity is — inevitably — at long last, gone. Whether the process is gradual or abrupt, however, none can truly say. Some claim that Ancients wander off into the Thorns, only to later emerge as Gentry, while others believe that they suddenly slough off their human masks entirely and embrace the power and madness of Arcadia all at once.%0a%3c %0a%3c *The Lost Pantheon keeps gateways into realms of spirit that have nothing to do with the Thorns or distant Arcadia, which may be the otherworlds believed in by ancient mortal societies. Gods and monsters utterly alien to Arcadia wander in those forgotten places, and the Ancients may be enslaved to them. Or, perhaps, they are the masters, and those inhuman entities are their servants. %0a%3c %0a%3c *Ancients gather once a century to hunt the Others who stalk (or are trapped in) either the Hedge or the mortal world, having long ago learned rituals used to extract the power, and perhaps even the immortality, of the Gentry. For a staggeringly steep price, they might be willing to teach these grim rites to those not sworn into their order, though the prize would almost certainly not be worth the cost. Some rumors say that accepting such a boon from an Ancient binds a changeling’s soul to that Ancient’s will, while others believe that even attempting the process is fatal to one not numbered among the Lost Pantheon.%0a%3c %0a

When not playing hosts to debauchery, the du Chagnes toyed with the affections of naïve youths in the Court, tempting them with deviant pleasures and empty promises of power and wealth. Their lifestyle attracted a Daeva, who thought that the pair would make lovely Kindred. Indeed, the du Chagnes prospered in the Danse Macabre, learning new ways to toy with emotion and losing themselves in their won self-gratification.%0a%3c %0a%3c When the Revolution came, Albaric du Chagne and his sire were destroyed by the sun and Eglatina only barely managed to save herself by entering Torpor. When she rose again, her heart was consumed with grief over the loss of her husband. She took in several mortal retainers, hoping to use them to satisfy her debased appetites and to salve her grief. Strangely, the old methods failed to elicit any joy in her dead heart. Even more bizarrely, the loss of the Vicomte and her sire twisted her ministrations, forcing the protégées (as she preferred to call her subjects) to share her sadness and regret, feeling it as their own. Most broke under the mixture of physical and psychological torment, but a small handful flourished. No matter what she levied against their flesh and minds, these servants begged for more. Impressed, she eventually Embraced them, traning them in the ways of the Vitae as she had been trained.%0a%3c %0a%3c Modern Duchagne find themselves ostracized by more careful Kindred. Rumors abound about just what the Bacchantes are capable of doing, and few wish to find out from personal experience. Indeed, the grand balls held by the bloodline on special occasions are often more than most care to see. These gatherings are used by members to parade their latest proteges, or to display particularly clever uses of the bloodline's ability to manipulate the senses.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Requirements: %0a%3c %0a%3c :Clan: Daeva%0a%3c %0a%3c :Interactions with the Danse: The bloodline's place among the various covenants and Kindred Society%0a%3c %0a%3c :Nickname:  Bacchantes%0a%3c %0a%3c :Bloodline Bane: Duchagne Kindred are prone to ennui and boredom to an extent that far surpasses that of other Kindred. They may never buy the Patient merit, and the maximum number of Extended rolls they can make for a mundane action are capped at their Humanity if it’s lower than their base dice pool. As well, they always suffer repeated action penalties for any action re-attempted in the same Night, even if not in stressful situations, due to boredom as much as frustration or mounting difficulties. %0a%3c %0a%3c :Bloodline Disciplines: Celerity, Majesty, Nightmare, Vigor%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Bloodline Gift: Licencieux%0a%3c %0a%3c :Description: To some, Licencieux is the greatest achievement of Eglatina du Chagne’s focused grief; to others, Licencieux is the stolen secret of les arts licencieux shared by the Vicomtesse’s unnamed sire.

With it, the vampire warps the senses of her prey, manipulating others toward her own perverse goals.%0a%3c %0a%3c Mechanically Licencieux is a series of Devotions combining the effects of Majesty and Nightmare in a way unique to the bloodline; many of them also learn more common Devotions along these lines, such as Cross-Contamination and Wet Dream. All Duchagne learn Intime for free upon joining the Bloodline. The others may be purchased in any order, and cost Experiences equal to their level.%0a%3c %0a%3c Intime: %0a%3c %0a%3c With an instant action, the Bacchante is able to conjure up a sort of Nostalgic aura around themselves. This causes those nearby them to experience momentary flashes of memory, good or bad (at the Duchagne’s discretion), relating to the situation at hand. This causes a sort of positive or negative association with an action or circumstance, granting the Suchagne a bonus equal to the higher of their Majesty or Nightmare (minimum 1) to Manipulation rolls on anyone affected by the aura, so long as it has something to do with correlation formed in their mind (positive or negative, they don’t need to know the exact memory inspired). Kindred (and others with an appropriate Aura) may lash out against the Duchagne when this effect is active; if they’re successful, it has no effect on them. %0a%3c This may not be active at the same time as Awe or Dread Presence, though the Kindred may switch between them.%0a%3c %0a%3c La Touche Illusoire: %0a%3c %0a%3c With this ability, the unsettling, near-terrifying illusions inspired by Dread Presence can be altered slightly. When utilizing Dread Presence, this Devotion may be activated reflexively to cause more positive, enjoyable, but still limited and fleeting illusions that may work alongside the less pleasant ones. These more enjoyable sensations may shift the effects of the Kindred’s aura slightly, removing the inability to spend Willpower against them and instead lowering their effective Composure by 1 with regards to the Duchagne’s Social rolls or Powers against them. An instant action is needed to switch between the two effects.%0a%3c Prerequisites: Majesty 1, Nightmare 1%0a%3c %0a%3c Douleur Agréable:%0a%3c %0a%3c By applying waves of pleasure or pain onto a subject, the Bacchante is able to more fully sculpt their behavior and personality, correlating pain with those things they discourage and pleasure with those they want the subject to partake in more often. Roll Intelligence + Empathy + (Lower of Majesty and Nightmare) as an instant action vs the subject’s Composure + Blood Potency. If the Duchagne wins, they inflict the Insensate Tilt for a turn, representing extreme pain or pleasure, and then the Swooning or Scarred condition, for pleasure or pain respectively. On an exceptional success, inflict Wanton or Bestial too, even if the target’s already had it within the last month. Repeated (successful) uses of this on the same sort of action for the same subject (more than the target’s Composure in a Story) can cause the Phobia or Obsession condition relating to the action or circumstance, as appropriate.%0a%3c Prerequisites: Majesty 2, Nightmare 2%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c New Condition: Phobia (Persistent)%0a%3c %0a%3c You’ve grown a deep seated fear or someone or something, and find it difficult to remain in its presence, or otherwise confront it.

What if that blood is clotted and stolen? The Children of Midas are dead men who suck ambition from the blood and marrow of the living. Like the gods of the Aztecs, they can turn blood to gold and gold to blood.The Adrestoi are creatures of the city, but more than that, creatures of its elite. They become one with its monoliths, command kine and beast alike. In death, they retain the vigor of life, but their will to power is dependent on the power of their blood. Fed well, an Adrestos is an irresistible force of command and conquest. Should he fail at the hunt, though, he becomes weak and easily swayed.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Background:%0a%3c %0a%3c The Adrestoi are a young bloodline, the product of their progenitor’s fierce will and the mutations that ancestor wrought in his own Blood. He spawned his brood and line young, and they have evolved together. In the Detroit of the 1980s, Paul Gordon was a man with a mission. Amid the decay of the great automotive firms and the fires that swept regularly through the neighborhoods where he grew up, Paul learned to impose will over fear. He traded his father’s blue collar for white, and he went off to law school. When he returned, a lawyer with a Georgetown degree, he started to make friends. The kind of friends who appreciated a white collar speckled with a little blood. The vampire wasn’t far behind.%0a%3c %0a%3c He was looking for a servant, a cover, but Paul wore the monster down, manipulated and fought against him until the vampire Embraced him less by choice than force. Paul’s sire was young to begin with, an Ancilla too used to having mortal crutches. Once the attorney became the vampire, he made short and bloody work of his sire. Their merged blood changed fast, and altered in Paul’s image. Invigorated, alive with cannibalized and mutated Vitae, he experienced an urge unusual among young Damned. He wanted to share. So he changed his name to Adrestos, the son of the legendary King Midas, and he Embraced the first of his line, the Adrestoi.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Clan: Ventrue%0a%3c %0a%3c :Interactions with the Danse:%0a%3c The Children of Midas are known for results, but also for obsession. Many Ventrue look at the hunt as a disgraceful necessity, something untidy and to be kept private. The Adrestoi hunt in packs, instead, and those who have joined the Lancea Sanctum are often perceived as zealots as a consequence. Those with no such allegiance are often suspected of affliction with Malkavia or simply to have become too monstrous too fast. Where they are recognized as a bloodline, they are sometimes pitied. When encountered alone, they are often feared. Pitied or feared, Adrestoi are also well-liked. After all, they have a lot to offer. If they hunt frequently and almost openly... well, that habit is no less distasteful than the predilections of some of the other lines. Their tenacity, seemingly wired in the blood, makes them effective allies even when very young; for just as their weakness drains Vitae, it conserves their inner strength. They can turn anything to gold, given their fill of blood…%0a%3c %0a%3c :Nickname: Children of Midas%0a%3c %0a%3c :Bloodline Bane: Use of discipline aspects with No Cost or that utilize Willpower add 1 point of Vitae to their cost. %0a%3c %0a%3c :Bloodline Disciplines: Dominate, Animalism, Majesty, Resilience%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Bloodline Gift: Scientia est Potentia (•-•••••)%0a%3c %0a%3c :Description:  Scientia is a Style Merit focused on Feeding and Hunting.

At the end of the night there just wasn’t any doubt of the outcome.''%0a%3c %0a%3c The lodge itself is not very big and it doesn’t help that the Uratha are divided amongst themselves when it comes to the embassy and the accords, nevertheless this lodge was born out of a desire to promote and secure the position of the Uratha of the tribes of the moon as a faction on the embassy of Portland, though less known too it’s that they also are on the lookout of the possibility of another war being waged and work both to ensure that it doesn’t happen or failing that, that the Uratha come on top of it. One of the things that they focus though is understanding the others supernatural denizens of the city and also networking with the different factions, “keep your friends close and your enemies closer” rings truth and chiefly among them, though who they consider friends and enemies is not something they openly discuss, they do lend themselves to hunting down threats to the embassy when asked or sometimes even when not, giving them a reputation of helpful hunters at best and meddlers at worst.%0a%3c %0a%3c They draw members from any tribe so long as they aligns themselves with embassy accords, they have a preference on Elodoths and Irraka over the other auspices, drawing on the ease these two auspices have when talking with others for either securing cooperation or drawing secrets out of them. %0a%3c %0a%3c On the hunt they are not that different from any other werewolves, they do bring however a considerable network of contacts and allies into play when the hunt takes them away from their own territory and are forced through unfamiliar territory, they have a better time avoiding stepping on toes when it does happen and thanks to keeping good or just cordial relationships with the others can in a limited fashion piggy ride on the work the others have done on their territory for their advantage provided they don’t abuse the privilege.%0a%3c %0a%3c To that end, their given word is specially binding to them, what they agree to they will make sure to fulfill to the best of their abilities, following both the letter and the spirit of the contract they bind themselves to, the accords being one such contract it holds a great deal of importance to them, on the other hand because of this oath breakers are hold on special contempt by lodge members and weaseling out of a deal it’s grounds for a formal challenge or demands of reparation and they have a surprisingly easy time spotting when someone is doing just that or just lying to their face.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Requirements: Must be Pro-Embassy/Accords%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Totem: The Witness of the Pact%0a%3c %0a%3c The Witness of the Pact is a spirit born when the Uratha banded together and the war started to take its toll on the werewolves packs on the city, it pledged its support then because the wolves needed a unifying force and it grew on strength while they remained united, though because of its ban it eventually grew weary of them when they gave their word to the Lost and chose to break it when failing to fulfill their end of the bargain.%0a%3c %0a%3c The spirit however has not forgotten where it came from and stills wishes to honor the alliance it had with the Uratha of the city, with the signing of the accords it forces its lodge members to abide by them but also be on guard when it comes to traitors and oath breakers lets it’s them that end up paying the price, it preaches honesty but not to the point of stupidity, it acknowledges the need for secrecy as well.%0a%3c %0a%3c Nowadays it has grown with the influence of the embassy and the essence it distills from the peacekeeping done among the factions and while it has ties to the embassy it’s primarily bound and contracted with the werewolves.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Lodge Bonds %0a%3c :Blessing: The lodge members enjoy the condition Connected (Embassy/Accords) and once per month you can spend a willpower point to get it back if they have burned it or otherwise resolved it, it also allows them to buy pack tactics that take others into account and use them at the cost of +&#9679; if they are packmates (storytellers at the final arbiters of what applies to non-werewolf members when it comes to pack tactics) non packmates don't count even if they have been added with facets like Pack Triumphs Together.

The exact recipe is a secret known only to the members of the bloodline, but there is one ingredient that is very well known – blood. Any character who is bathed in this special mixture, along with at least one point of the pretty’s own Vitae, is cleansed of all blemishes, scars, and other unsightly marks; for a number of nights equal to the Galloi’s Blood Potency, the anointed character’s skin becomes as flawless as porcelain. A living subject appears younger – regardless of his actual age, he looks to be in the prime of his life for as long as the Taurobolium’s invigoration lasts. A Kindred subject retains his apparent age, but benefits from the effects of the Blush of Life for the duration instead.%0a%3c %0a%3c A Galloi can also learn Devotions that add other, additional effects to the Taurobolium. Each such Devotion has a Vitae cost, which must be added to the bath in addition to the point spent for the basic effects. The first Devotion, Enliven the Flesh, is free, learned automatically as a benefit of joining the Bloodline. Additional Devotions cost 2 experiences each, and have a prerequisite Discipline, which the Galloi must possess at 2 dots or higher in order to learn the Devotion.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Enliven the Flesh%0a%3c The Galloi can add one additional point of her Vitae into the bath to magnify the subject’s natural beauty, granting him one dot of Striking Looks. If the subject already had Striking Looks, this Devotion increases it to two dots. If the subject already had two dots, he gains a third dot. These Merits are not protected by the Sanctity of Merits rule, and are lost when the effects of the Tarubolium end.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Blessing of the Captive Eye%0a%3c With this Devotion, the Galloi can spend a point of Willpower when performing the Tarubolium to grant a living subject the benefits of the Lost Visage, or take those benefits away from a Kindred subject.

Once they have the ability to do so, most%0a%3c Lords of the Inanimate permanently awaken the spirits of the objects and devices they used%0a%3c most often.

Members include everything from individuals who authenticate%0a%3c or restore valuable antiques to archaeologists and even chefs. Members of this Legacy%0a%3c come from all social classes and professions but are united by the attention they pay to the%0a%3c objects and devices they use as part of their daily lives. They also tend to be highly physical%0a%3c and even sensual individuals who enjoy physically experiencing the world around them.%0a%3c Members who do not work with their hands extensively in their chosen professions almost%0a%3c always enjoy hobbies where they do so.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Appearance: Animists pay close attention to all the goods they regularly use. Regardless of%0a%3c whether they prefer rugged outdoor clothing or expensive and fancy suits, all their clothes%0a%3c are well-made and maintained. Few Animists would consider purchasing shoddy or ill-made%0a%3c goods or goods that will wear out quickly. They prefer to have time to develop a close%0a%3c relationship with their possessions. Animists are also unusually careful in the way they use%0a%3c objects and avoid slamming doors or otherwise harshly using objects unless it is necessary.%0a%3c In stories about Animists Told by other mages, the followers of this Legacy regularly talk to%0a%3c the objects and devices they use, and some mages watch Animists closely to see whether%0a%3c they are actually whispering or listening to their wristwatches or pocketknives. In reality, only%0a%3c a few of the most eccentric Animists talk to objects when not in private or using the%0a%3c Attainments of their Legacy. Instead, to avoid being seen as deeply eccentric and potentially%0a%3c even unbalanced, the vast majority of Animists are far more discrete. However, most touch%0a%3c and sometimes even caress the objects they use; often rewarding a well-functioning object%0a%3c in much the same manner a dog owner would pet a dog that performed a trick particularly%0a%3c well.\\%0a%3c Many Animists are exceedingly knowledgeable about the various sorts of objects and%0a%3c devices they regularly use and can go on at great length about the relative merits of different%0a%3c cell phones, cars, computers or different brands of tools. However, most are also at least%0a%3c moderately socially adept and understand at least the basics of how not to bore or annoy%0a%3c those to whom they are talking.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Doctrine%0a%3c %0a%3c :Prerequisites: Matter 2, Persuasion 2, Crafts 1%0a%3c %0a%3c :Initiation: The applicant must present at a Conclave (see below) an object of excellent%0a%3c quality that they have crafted themselves by ‘hand’ - meaning that mundane tools are%0a%3c allowed but using magic to shape them is not. The creation is judged by a panel of Lords,%0a%3c who also take the opinion of the object’s spirit into consideration.%0a%3c :Organization: Some Animists get along better with the spirits of their favorite objects than%0a%3c with other humans, including other mages, and many have little time for formal ceremonies%0a%3c or bureaucracy. As a result, Animists have a fairly loose organization, where members keep%0a%3c in touch on a moderately informal basis. In the past decade, this trend has been further%0a%3c exacerbated by the fact that an increasing number of Animists are rousing the spirits of their%0a%3c cell phones and answering machines and having them screen calls and deal with most%0a%3c callers like an especially skilled 24-hour secretary.\\%0a%3c In most cases, Animists are connected to one another by ties of personal friendship, with%0a%3c those who are well liked or respected by their fellows having far more contact with other%0a%3c members of this Legacy. The only exception to this loose and informal contact is during the%0a%3c Legacy’s yearly Conclave. Held in a different city each year, this Conclave is a chance for%0a%3c members to meet, for individuals who wish to become members to attempt to convince an%0a%3c Animist to teach them, and for the various Animists to show off the various spirits with which%0a%3c they are working.\\%0a%3c With an atmosphere somewhere between an academic conference, a high-end craft fair and%0a%3c a dog show, Conclaves are chaotic events wherein members report about interesting or%0a%3c unusual applications of their abilities. The most chaotic and prestigious part of the Conclave%0a%3c consists of the more experienced members showing off objects whose spirits they have%0a%3c awakened. In addition, Animists also discuss and demonstrate ways they have found to be%0a%3c able to work in tandem with their spirits. As noted, the Conclave is also where prospective%0a%3c members can attempt to convince an Animist to teach them. This in-person contact is%0a%3c crucial, because many Animists decide whether those prospective members are worthy to%0a%3c join this Legacy by watching them interact with the objects around them.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Magic%0a%3c %0a%3c :Ruling Arcana: Arcana Type%0a%3c :Yantras: Carrying out maintenance on an object (+1), building an object from scratch using%0a%3c your hands (+2 when using machines that are powered by the users own muscles, +1 with%0a%3c power tools), laying out plans or scale models, e.g. technical drawing, knitting pattern (+2).%0a%3c :Oblations: Polishing or caring for tools and equipment, knitting, carving or performing other%0a%3c handcrafts, selecting materials for use in some craft project.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Attainments%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!First Attainment: Commanding the Inanimate%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Initiation%0a%3c The Mage can control mechanical%0a%3c and electrical objects in a fashion%0a%3c similar to Remote Control (MtA,%0a%3c p155) simply by conversing with it.%0a%3c Objects perform the requests%0a%3c made of them with a maximum dice%0a%3c pool of the Mage’s Matter dots.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Optional: Spirit 1%0a%3c The Mage may address the spirit of an object%0a%3c directly, as per the spell Exorcist’s Eye (MtA, p180).%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Second Attainment: Exalting the Form%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Matter 2, Crafts 2%0a%3c Objects are inclined to work more efficiently when in the%0a%3c hand of a Lord of the Inanimate. A tool gains the 9-%0a%3c Again quality as per Find the Balance (MtA, p155).%0a%3c %0a%3c :Optional: Spirit 2%0a%3c The Mage may transfer Essence to or from the spirit%0a%3c of an object in a fashion similar to Channel Essence%0a%3c (MtA, p180). If channelling to a spirit, the Mage is%0a%3c restricted only by their Gnosis-derived Mana per%0a%3c turn rate. The Mage cannot take Essence from a%0a%3c spirit against their will using this Attainment - they must either have persuaded it or placated it through some other obligation.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Third Attainment: Shepherd of the Craft%0a%3c :Prerequisites: Matter 3, Persuasion 3%0a%3c With a touch, the Mage restores a number of Structure%0a%3c points to a damaged object equal to their dots in Matter.%0a%3c At the STs discretion this may also provide a bonus to%0a%3c further negotiations with the object’s spirit.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Optional: Spirit 3%0a%3c The Mage may also heal the spirit of that object, restoring two boxes of bashing damage for%0a%3c each dot of Spirit the Mage possesses.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Fourth Attainment: Name%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Matter 4, Crafts 3%0a%3c The Mage can grant an object a semblance of life and allow it autonomous movement. The%0a%3c Attainment does not grant physical features that the object does not already possess - a%0a%3c humanoid statue could serve drinks or fight enemies, but an animated car can only steer%0a%3c itself and open its own doors.\\%0a%3c This Attainment effectively grants the Mage dots in Retainer equal to their dots in Matter as%0a%3c per Golem (MtA 158). The Mage may elect to renew the duration of at any time before the%0a%3c current duration expires, but must be present with the servant to do so.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Optional: Spirit 4%0a%3c The Mage has the power to grant sentience and self-awareness to an object’s spirit. In%0a%3c addition to the animation granted above, the Mage may enter into a conversation with the%0a%3c spirit (at least for the length of their Ritual Interval) and use Rouse Spirit (MtA, p182) with%0a%3c Advanced Duration on the object. For a cost of 1 Mana the effect can be made Indefinite.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Fifth Attainment: Name%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Matter 5, Persuasion 4%0a%3c As a person now befitting the title of Lord, the Mage can now reshape matter to their will. By%0a%3c touching an object and speaking gently to it, they may vastly reconfigure an object to any%0a%3c design.\\%0a%3c The Mage can reshape Matter in any form as per the Shaping spell (MtA, p156), with Reach%0a%3c reducing the required successes for creating intricate shapes by their dots in Matter and%0a%3c granting the ability to shape solid matter. This includes intricate mechanisms and moving%0a%3c parts - the Mage may change a hunk of steel into a complex gear-driven mechanism, for%0a%3c example. For a cost of 1 Mana, the Mage may affect an object up to Size 15.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Optional: Spirit 5%0a%3c With their grandest Attainment, a Lord of the Inanimate may reshape an ephemeral being as%0a%3c easily as solid matter. As per the Shape Spirit spell (MtA, p184), they may invoke a number%0a%3c of effects equal to their dots in Spirit with the option of healing Aggravated damage with%0a%3c Mana on a one-for-one basis. The effects use the Advanced Duration Factors and the Mage%0a%3c must converse with the spirit for a minimum of their Ritual Interval.%0a

The%0a%3c Quiet philosophy asks its adherents to working of magic within the limits of the Fallen World,%0a%3c within what the Quiescence already draws the line for. Already prone to drawing suspicion from%0a%3c other Awakened, especially that they were Seer fronts, the Legacy lost what tenuous contact it%0a%3c maintained with the larger Awakened society when one of their founders turned Banisher and%0a%3c started hunting them down.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Quiet philosophy was largely a product of the 1940s and the 1950s, and when the zeitgeist%0a%3c gave way so did the Legacy's main appeal. However, the Liars were always good with keeping%0a%3c their heads down from the authorities, especially with a murderous Banisher on their trails, and%0a%3c a few Quiet cabals have survived to the modern era. With the advent of communications and%0a%3c social media technology, there have even been mages who reinvented the Quiet philosophy in%0a%3c the modern age to better hide from prying Sleeper eyes, some of which have successfully%0a%3c inherited the Quiescents' old mantle.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Origins%0a%3c %0a%3c :Parentage: Moros, Guardians of the Veil or Nameless%0a%3c :Background&#8203;: The original Liars drew from war veterans, or those who were affected by the%0a%3c World War in one way. They were often comfortable with illegal, if not criminal activities, for the%0a%3c Legacy's founders felt morality less important to their own behavioral code over magic, and%0a%3c morality is best taken in moderation after seeing what horrors a moral man can do. While%0a%3c modern Liars aren't so familiar with war, they are still adept at evading the law and working in%0a%3c grey zones, especially when it comes to avoiding scrutiny.%0a%3c :Appearances&#8203;: Quiescent mages live on the fringe of society, where they can fade into the%0a%3c background easily. This is easier in the modern era, where big cities that allow such are plenty.%0a%3c Liars dress simply as expected, and get on by with whatever work they find. Many do find work%0a%3c as investigators, or any other occupation where their skills would be needed.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Doctrine%0a%3c %0a%3c :Prerequisites: Time 2, Science 2, two dots in one of the following Skills; Investigation, Stealth,%0a%3c Brawl, Intimidation, Streetwise%0a%3c %0a%3c :Initiation&#8203;: The Legacy draws exclusively from practitioners of Quiet Magic, and even then it's%0a%3c usually the practitioner seeking them out than the Legacy approaching her. In the applicant's%0a%3c pursuit the elder Liars judge her ability and character, seeing if she can find them with minimal%0a%3c reliance on magic and on others' help.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Organization&#8203;: The Quiescent are one of the most diffused Legacies, the Legacy offering no%0a%3c greater organization to fall back on to and leaving each Liar on their own. The mentor severs%0a%3c regular contact when his pupil learns the Attainment she was calling to him to help on, and the%0a%3c pupil likewise moves on until she deems herself progressed enough for the next Attainment.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Theory&#8203;: The Quiescent do not think of the Quiescence as a Lie to be challenged, but just%0a%3c another principle of Supernal magic that can be worked through and around. They believe that it%0a%3c exists to protect Sleepers from the Awakened so that they may progress without intervention.%0a%3c Furthermore, they believe Quiescence also protect the Awakened from Sleepers so that they%0a%3c may work lesser but more stable wonders, free from Dissonance.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Magic%0a%3c %0a%3c :Ruling Arcana: Time%0a%3c :Yantras: Streets and alleys filled with non-descript buildings (+1); quietly observing the subject%0a%3c (+1); investigatory tools such as magnifiers (+1); confronting but not appearing in front of the%0a%3c subject (+1, +2 if managing the confrontation without verbal interaction)%0a%3c :Oblations&#8203;: Menial chores such as cleaning; solving a puzzle; mixing drinks; shadowing a%0a%3c Sleeper or a group of them%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Attainments%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!First Attainment: No Mistake%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Initiation%0a%3c The Liar wishes not to disturb the Quiet, so she learns to tread carefully. This Attainment divines%0a%3c whether the subject's next Supernal spell will provoke Quiescence with a "Yes" or "No" answer,%0a%3c essentially being a limited version of the "Divination" spell with Reach assigned to instant use.%0a%3c :Optional Arcana: Death 1%0a%3c Provocation of Quiescence and the taint of Paradox tend to go hand in hand, and the Silencer%0a%3c learns to pick up signs telling whether his subject is willing to be Quiet. This effect resembles the%0a%3c "Soul Marks" spell, but is limited to finding out if the subject is Awakened and if she is suffering a%0a%3c Paradox Condition. Reach is assigned to instant use.\\%0a%3c While Withstood by Resolve, the mage can bypass it if he uses this effect immediately after his%0a%3c subject casts a Supernal spell.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Second Attainment: No Past%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Time 2, Science 3%0a%3c The Liar learns to mask themselves from temporal scrutiny into their pasts. This Attainment%0a%3c resembles the "Shield of Chronos" spell, with Reach assigned to Advanced Duration. While%0a%3c providing no protection over the future, the Attainment's protection over the past extends to%0a%3c mundane investigations as well. Mundane scrutiny automatically fails, and the Liar scores%0a%3c automatic successes equal to her Time dots on Clash of Wills provoked by magical scrutiny.\\%0a%3c To use this Attainment, the Liar must spend a scene ritually destroying personal belongings that%0a%3c betray her past life, most often pictures and identification, and other items she has used%0a%3c extensively.%0a%3c :Optional&#8203;: Death 2%0a%3c The Silencer can now move subtly enough in the present that he doesn't leave a past trail that%0a%3c could follow him. He replicates the "Without a Trace" spell, with Reach assigned to Advanced%0a%3c Duration. The required preparation for this effect is identical to that of the Attainment's main%0a%3c effect, and can be taken in conjunction to enable both effects.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Third Attainment: No Present%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Time 3, two dots in a second Skill among the optional prerequisite Skills%0a%3c Hiding one's past is only the first step towards hiding yourself from unwanted attention, and the%0a%3c Liar must learn to protect her present self from unexpected encounters as well. This Attainment%0a%3c duplicates the "Momentary Flux" spell, with Reach assigned to instant use, Advanced Duration,%0a%3c and gaining an Initiative bonus when acting on the gleaned information.%0a%3c :Optional&#8203;: Death 3%0a%3c The Quiescent is familiar with violence more than they appear to be, and a Silencer quickly%0a%3c learns how to break things when needed to save his own skin. He emulates the "Decay" spell,%0a%3c with Reach assigned to instant use and directly decreasing the object's Structure.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Fourth Attainment: No Future%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Time 4, Science 4%0a%3c The Legacy was born in the uncertainty of the 1940s, with any prediction of humanity's future%0a%3c only a phantom. The modern era sympathizes still with that uncertainty of the future, and the%0a%3c Liar who internalizes it can choose to shift the future to her immediate benefit. This Attainment%0a%3c replicates the "Choose the Thread" spell, with Reach assigned to instant use and affecting%0a%3c supernatural powers including spellcasting.%0a%3c :Optional&#8203;: Death 4%0a%3c A Silencer's pursuit of a Quiet life rarely leaves him with only inanimate objects in his way. He%0a%3c duplicates the "Enervation" spell, with Reach assigned to instant use.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Fifth Attainment: No History%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Time 5, two dots in a third Skill among the optional prerequisite Skills%0a%3c No one is perfect, and even the most dedicated of the Quiescent find themselves violating their%0a%3c philosophy and the Fallen World. The Liar who reaches the pinnacle of her silent reservation in%0a%3c the status quo of the world gain the ability to amend mistakes of her own or others, changing%0a%3c history itself if needed. This Attainment resembles the "Corridors of Time" spell, with Reach%0a%3c assigned to allowing the Temporal Sympathy Attainment.\\%0a%3c With or without Temporal Sympathy, the Liar can only choose moments when the subject%0a%3c provoked Quiescence as the point of divergence, so that the subject never takes the course of%0a%3c action that provoked Quiescence.\\%0a%3c To use this Attainment, the Liar must spend a scene ritually creating a portfolio of the subject's%0a%3c life by using objects and symbols dear to them, and ritually destroying them in their presence.%0a%3c :Optional&#8203;: Death 5%0a%3c The Silencer outright destroys his own presence in the world, ensuring that he will not marr the%0a%3c Fallen World's natural progress. This effect resembles the "Empty Presence" spell, with Reach%0a%3c assigned to Advanced Duration. Instead of violence, however, it is the provocation of%0a%3c Quiescence that breaks the effect. The Silencer scores automatic successes equal to his Death%0a%3c dots in Clash of Wills provoked by Mage Sight or other abilities.\\%0a%3c To use this Attainment, the Silencer must spend a point of Mana, and follow the same%0a%3c preparation the Attainment's main effect requires.%0a

They tend to be more apt to ritually cast, using sigils and circles that can take some time to prepare. Ritual Circle (+2): Whether salt, sulfer or chalk, a circle denotes the eternal continuation of cycles, the old becoming the new, and vice versa. Any power using a ritual circle ends if the circle is broken, or the caster steps outside of it.%0a%3c :Oblations: Prayer to spirits or other beings, ceremonies meant to celebrate old traditions. Generally speaking done with either a roll of Wits+Occult, or Presence+Occult, depending on the styling of the ritual. Telling inspiring stories of the old ways: Presence+Expression/occult%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Attainments%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!First Attainment: Understanding the Katsina%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Initiation\\%0a%3c The Caretaker’s frst and most important revelation is the nature of her spirit guide; an incarnation of the Primal Wild whose nature most powerfully resonates with the mage’s own. This “spirit” (which is an archetypal ideal, rather than an individual entity) is an animal, elemental manifestation, plant, or something of the sort: coyotes, bears, ravens, mountains, streams, storms, cacti, or cedar trees, for example. When seen in Shadow, the mage possesses features reminiscent of the spirit guide. The player and Storyteller should work together to determine an appropriate spirit guide for the Caretaker.\\%0a%3c When activating this attainment, the Mage becomes able to see, hear, and speak with spirits for a couple turns at a time (per transitory duration), though this may be continually re-activated during a conversation to allow for 'uninterrupted' perception.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Second Attainment: Veil of the Katsina%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Spirit 2\\%0a%3c As connections grow between the Caretaker and their Guide, they begin to realize how to protect themselves from spiritual predation. They internalize the Ephemeral Shield spell, allowing them to activate it with a short ritual to gain its protection for the day.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Third Attainment: Calling the Katsina%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Spirit 3\\%0a%3c The Caretaker grows closer to oneness with her spirit guide, embracing its metaphysical qualities. The mage’s Primal connection grants her an Influence (as per spirit In&#64258;uences, on pp. 258-259 of Mage: The Awakening and Werewolf: The Forsaken page 187) with a descriptor identical to the nature of her guide, at a rating equal to half her Gnosis, rounding down. (In other words, a Gnosis 4 willworker who identifes with the wolf gains an In&#64258;uence of Wolves at two dots, while one with a Gnosis 8 whose spirit guide embodies rain gains an In&#64258;uence of Rain at four dots.) The mage rolls Gnosis + Spirit to use this In&#64258;uence and spends points of Mana in place of Essence, on a one-for-one basis. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Fourth Attainment: Becoming the Katsina%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Spirit 4\\%0a%3c With this Attainment, the Caretaker acquires the ability to temporarily physically incarnate certain of the qualities of his spirit guide, calling its ideal down from the Primal Wild and into himself, and becoming something halfway between spirit and &#64258;esh. By activating this attainment, the character becomes able to cross the Gauntlet as if with the spell Reaching with the Reach spent, forming an Iris that lasts for about a turn. They may also activate it without the Reach to become able to interact physically with the other side of the Gauntlet for up to a month at a time.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Optional Arcana: Life 4\\%0a%3c As an instant action, the Mage may take on effects appropriate to their spirit guide, akin to the Transform Life spell, with a number of features gained equal to the Mage's Life Arcanum. This lasts for up to a day at a time. As well, the Mage may gain access to these features automatically (for the same duration) upon activating the base attainment to interact with the other side of the Gauntlet (as that closeness draws their spirit guide in more easily).%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Fifth Attainment: Purity of Destruction%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Spirit 5\\%0a%3c At this level of understanding, the Caretaker understands that even those who try to meld the old with the new, must sometimes cut out a cancer before it has time to spread. Those that advance to this highest of levels are able to Annihilate Spirits at will, though they tend to use this power sparingly... This power is used more often after every other option has been exhausted, and tends to even then, only be used sparingly, as spirits tend to shy away from those with the power to end their very existence completely. This will affect any spirit up to Rank 5, and the Mage gains a number of successes on the ensuing Clash of Wills equal to their Spirit rating.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25''Perfected Adepts''%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Origins%0a%3c %0a%3c :Parentage: Obrimos or Adamantine Arrow%0a%3c %0a%3c (Background and History are as presented in Mage 1e, page 349)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Doctrine%0a%3c %0a%3c :Prerequisites: Life 2, Athletics 2, 2 dots in Brawl or Weaponry%0a%3c %0a%3c (Initiation as per Mage 1e)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Magic%0a%3c %0a%3c :Ruling Arcana: Life%0a%3c :Yantras: Rigorous Workout to focus the mind (+2), Meditate into a State of Peace (+2), Disregard Worldly Concerns in Pursuit of the Spell (+1, +2 if it imposes a Negative Condition)%0a%3c :Oblations: Rigorous Martial Arts Practice, Extended Meditations, Exhibiting Humility%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Attainments%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!First Attainment: Chi Sight%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Initiation\\%0a%3c With but a glance (and an instant action), the Monk can focus on the energies in a living thing call Chi or Prana, and discern information about the body it is contained within. This includes all information as per the spell Analyze Life including health, sex, species, age, conditions, tilts, and physical attribute dots. To focus on another individual, the mage must use this Attainment again. (As Per Life 1 Analyze Life)%0a%3c %0a%3c :Optional Arcanum: Forces 1\\%0a%3c Learning to use his Chi to subtly enhance his own actions, the Monk is able to run a little faster, jump a little further, or lift a little more. The total distance (in yards) covered on a jump, the subject’s swimming and running Speed, and any climbing or lifting rolls gain a bonus of +1. Actions are also less strenuous when moving so efficiently.The Monk gains a +1 bonus on rolls to resist fatigue. (as per Forces 1, Kinetic Efficiency)%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Second Attainment: Body Temple%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Life 2\\%0a%3c As long as the Monk practices his daily (ritual) exercise regimen, he maintains full control over his normally autonomous bodily functions, with effects identical to the Life 2 Body Control spell. (Ritual Cast, Advanced Duration)%0a%3c %0a%3c :Optional Arcanum: Forces 2\\%0a%3c More attuned to the subtle changes in temperature, vibration, and all the other minor variations in the forms of energy surrounding her that are often ignored, the Monk becomes able to intuitively feel as well as see forms of electromagnetic radiation, sound, and kinetic energies, allowing her to operate without penalty in complete darkness, and ignore any penalties from the Blindness or Deafness Tilts or Conditions. She can still see and hear and make out details, even in the dark, although colors and tones are somewhat muted. This increased sensitivity does make the Monk more vulnerable to bright lights and loud noises, which may inflict penalties equal to the Blindness condition. (As per Forces 1 Nightvision, Advanced Duration)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Third Attainment: Chi Force%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Life 3\\%0a%3c The Monk’s constant exercise regimen has granted him an unparalleled physique, permitting him to channel his chi into it to enhance the potency of musculature, suppleness of ligaments, or rigidity and durability of his frame. So long as the Monk maintains his daily exercise regimen, he may, each day, increase one attribute by his dots in Life for the remainder of the scene up to his normal maximum. (As per Life 3 Honing the Form, Ritual Cast, Advanced Duration)%0a%3c %0a%3c :Optional Arcana: Forces 3\\%0a%3c The Monk’s Chi can be channeled into more than his mere form, but can be projected out of his form in the manner of kinetic energy. With an instant action, the Monk may channel his chi into his melee attacks, increasing damage and turning it from Bashing into Lethal. Furthermore, any successful attack causes ripples of chi to pass directly through the subject disorientating them and applying the Stunned tilt. (As per Forces 2 Kinetic Strike, Spell Specific Reach)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Fourth Attainment: Inviolate Form%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Life 4\\%0a%3c The Monk may channel his Chi within himself or another to heal damage, as per Life 4 Mend.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Optional Arcana: Forces 4\\%0a%3c Channeling his Chi around himself the Monk is able to use it to redirect objects that would otherwise strike him. As an Instant Action, the Monk can focus his chi about him; thereafter as a reflexive action he can redirect a number of objects each round equal to his dots in Forces. These must all be of size 5 or less and the monk cannot redirect them unless he could apply his Defense. However, this effect does function against even individuals, allowing the Monk to deflect melee attacks. (As per Forces 3 Turn Momentum, Spell Specific Reach)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Fifth Attainment: Perfect Body%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Life 5\\%0a%3c As per the previous attainment, Chi Force, but the Monk may choose two physical attributes to enhance, and he may increase either or both above his normal maximum. (As per Life 3 Honing the Form, Ritual Cast, Advanced Duration, Spell Specific Reaches +2)    %0a%3c %0a%3c :Optional Arcana: Forces 5\\%0a%3c With an instant action, and a point of Mana, the Monk is able to release his Chi as bolts of pure energy in an aimed attack, doing aggravated damage equal to his Forces dots. (As per Forces 4 Thunderbolt, Spell Specific Reach)%0a%3c %0a

Not every city, of course, has more than a handful of either, and even those populated by both will sometimes have their populations kept apart by fear, xenophobia, or perhaps just silent agreements. But in nearly every nation both can be found, you’ll find a few together. An Iron Master who’s taken to studying the local Kindred, both seeking out parallels with humanity and how they themselves interact with the human herd. The Mekhet who’s learned of the spirits by silently and respectfully watching from the side as an old friend’s pack performs their rites. A Bone Shadow seeking a strange form of insight by sacrificing his prey over an Acolyte’s altar. %0a%3c %0a%3c And of course, the Dead Wolf running with the Pack.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Background%0a%3c *“''This Story is True''. They say that before the blood reacts beneath the auspice moon, it’s as malleable as any human’s. You can be killed and risen as some zombie, permanently merged with a spirit, or even Embraced by one of our kind. Our founder, if you can call him by such a formal-sounding title, was chosen by Luna, but before his change, his blood was claimed by a Savage who’d taken on a bane forcing her into frenzy any time the full moon shone down upon her. He was just the one that was unlucky enough to be in her path when it did, but somehow, her Beast chose not to kill, but to reproduce, and she did it right in Luna’s face.”%0a%3c *“''This Story is True''. You know of the firstborn, Urdur, those known to take on the mantle of our tribes, those children of Father Wolf that came before any others. They became the patrons of our Tribes and that of our… less wise cousins, and are spoken of in countless tales. But Father Wolf’s spirit children were not the only his essence found its way into. Some few say that he sired another, a wolf formed not of ephemera, but the essence of darkness itself, recognizable by yellow eyes among a body that’s otherwise nothing more than Shadow. It refuses patronage to those few of the People that have sought it out, but some say it’s granted a blessing to others…”%0a%3c *“Yeah, what do they call ‘em, the fuckin’ Dead Wolves? I heard a story about ‘em. One o’ ours, some Mexican guy, I don’ know his name, they say he found his way into some spirit realm, or whatever shit the acolytes are always talkin’ about. Came across his Beast, but like, some creepy haunted version of it, and it, uh, whaddya call it, possessed him, like the damned owls do? And merged with him. But he didn’ lose control. For some reason, grabbed the attention of those lupine guys, and it all broke down from there. No, I don’t fuckin’ know if the story’s true!”  %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!The Becoming%0a%3c %0a%3c The Dead Wolves are most prevalent in northern Mexico, where the Uratha and Kindred have formed more substantive ties, and thus are less wary about getting close to each other, but despite what many think, the Dead Wolves don’t NEED to have ties with the Uratha. Still, allies or contacts among the Forsaken (or other Werewolves) are common, and those that already have a connection to them are most likely to be noticed and chosen by those of the bloodline, whether to become a Childe in the first place or simply to be brought closer beneath an Avus’ tutelage.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Requirements:%0a%3c %0a%3c The Dead Wolves are Gangrel, the Savages being the only Kindred that truly understand the form the Beast takes, and thus have the unique ability to shape it to match that which dwells within the soul of the Uratha.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Clan: Gangrel%0a%3c %0a%3c :Interactions With the Danse:%0a%3c %0a%3c Unsurprisingly, in areas where tensions between Kindred and Uratha are high or at least far short of allegiance, but where there’s still communication, a position often forms as a sort of ambassador (when most respected) or message-carrier (when not so well thought of) between the Kindred and the local Werewolves. Dead Wolves, of course, are uniquely suited to such roles, and often serve them even if not made to do so in a formal manner. %0a%3c Beyond that, the Circle likely harbors the highest number of them, followed, oddly enough, by the Sanctified. The Ordo Dracul and Carthians are probably next most likely, for the sake of studying their mixed condition in the former case or simply due to the ‘looser’ structure of the latter fitting them better. The Invictus very rarely take on those of this bloodline, but it’s not entirely unheard of. %0a%3c %0a%3c :Nickname: Wolf-Blooded (confusing as that may be among Uratha society)%0a%3c %0a%3c :Bloodline Bane:%0a%3c %0a%3c The Dead Wolves take on a mirrored aspect of Luna’s influence, and so find themselves vulnerable to the substance that resonates most harshly with her children: silver. At Humanity 6, all Dead Wolves take on Repulsion (Silver) as a bane, though may choose a form of Detachment to stave off as normal, but it inherently counts against the limits of three banes either way.%0a%3c %0a%3c In addition, those that have aligned with a Pack of Uratha find that their Beast resonates with their distant cousins’. They gain a “Trigger” for their Beast’s frenzy, similarly to a Uratha’s Kuruth trigger, but automatically aligned to The Pack. Whenever they see a member of their Pack harmed (with at least lethal damage), they must roll to resist frenzy. If the roll fails, their Beast will ALWAYS take on their Predatory Aspect, if they know that discipline, but this only applies to frenzy triggered through the Pack. %0a%3c %0a%3c :Bloodline Disciplines: Animalism, Vigor, Protean, Resilience%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Bloodline Gift: Sublunario%0a%3c %0a%3c Sublunario, the gift of the Dead Wolves, is a manifestation of both Luna’s influence on her Undead children, and the aspects of the Wolf they’ve taken on through their blood. This provides them with a small array of benefits that becomes more potent when the Dead Wolf is part of a Pack.%0a%3c *All Dead Wolves have a Tell, chosen from those that the Wolf-Blooded have access to, whether they shared the blood of the Uratha in life or not. In addition, they may buy Wolf-Blooded merits if they don’t rely on any trait the Kindred doesn’t have (such as Integrity). %0a%3c *Given their spiritual ties, Dead Wolves may purchase the Totem merit if part of a pack (whether a Pack in Werewolf terms, Gangrel terms, or both). The Totem provides the normal benefits, but cannot grant traits Vampires are normally incapable of gaining (such as certain merits) to Kindred. %0a%3c *Dead Wolves treat their Blood Potency multiplied by two as effective Renown for calculating effective Spirit Rank, and may spend a point of Vitae to “flare” their spiritual might similar to a Uratha’s brand, treating their natural Blood Potency divided by 2 (round up) as the effective rating, for the purposes of any respect accorded. This grants Dead Wolves the “Proven“ condition. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Proven%0a%3c Your character is a Proven member of the People, despite having a Kindred’s Beast instead of an inner Wolf. She’s integrated, shown her strength, and can hold her own against the more natural born hunters she stands among. Those Uratha that know of this often feel the need to see for themselves just how well she can withstand their world. Any rolls to test the character’s strength, loyalty, or right to be among the Uratha gains a +2 bonus, but doing so often simply reinforces her right to be there. %0a%3c :Possible Sources: A Dead Wolf flaring their Blood Potency by spending Vitae.%0a%3c :Resolution: After at least one Uratha character, or a character that’s knowingly a part of one’s pack, has taken advantage of the +2 bonus, you may shed this condition. In doing so, you may add your character’s Blood Potency divided by 2 (round up) as automatic successes to a social roll among the Uratha, or to a roll utilizing one of the skills associated with the auspice of the current moon phase. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25werewolf%25'''Lodges'''%25%25%0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25mage%25'''Legacies'''%25%25%0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25werewolf%25'''Lodges'''%25%25%0a

Once the mechanics are worked out, the Storymasters will approve if they feel it makes sense for the current setting. Once approved, they may be joined like official 2nd edition Z-Splats, as if they already exist.%0a%3c *Completely custom Z-Splats may be sent to the Rulesmaster and then Storymasters above, and will receive more scrutiny. You MUST meet the prerequisites to create an entirely custom Z-Splat IC, per the rules given in the respective books, as your character is creating it themself. There will be NO exceptions to this.%0a%3c **Creating a custom Z-splat uses up your custom power creation for the month, and may not be submitted alongside other custom things.%0a%3c **If the Z-Splat has custom powers of some kind, you’ll need a Justification for each dot of said powers, but these can be spread out over the course of you buying them. %0a%3c **Lodges specifically need at least 2 founding members, as there’s no way to attract a powerful enough Totem (Rank 2+) without at least that many people.%0a%3c **Entitlements will use the rules in the Chapter 3 document until we update them, but only need 2 people to form the initial Oath for a new one. %0a%3c %0a%3c [[#to1]]%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c (:include GameRef.Directoryhelp:)%0a%3c %0a%3c The Storytelling System, Beast the Primordial, Changeling the Lost, Chronicles of Darkness, Demon the Descent, Mage the Awakening, Vampire the Requiem, and Werewolf the Forsaken ©2014-2016 CCP hf and published by Onyx Path Publishing.%0a%3c Produced by Jeff Vandenberg.
