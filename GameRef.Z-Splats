If you meet the prerequisites of an existing one, the actual joining can be done as a Bluebook or a PRP scene, submitted as an XP Expenditure (even if it normally doesn’t cost you anything). %0a*A character must be sanctioned at least a month before submitting a Z-Splat that requires any amount of customization.%0a*2nd Edition Z-Splats (Lodges, Entitlements, Bloodlines, Legacies) that are already published may be taken normally through whatever means is typical, if appropriate to the area and non-antagonistic. %0a*1st Edition official Z-Splats may be sent in to the Rulesmaster (as Custom Item/Power) with an attempt to convert them to fit the 2nd edition differences. Once the mechanics are worked out, the Storymasters will approve if they feel it makes sense for the current setting. Once approved, they may be joined like official 2nd edition Z-Splats, as if they already exist.%0a*Completely custom Z-Splats may be sent to the Rulesmaster and then Storymasters above, and will receive more scrutiny. You MUST meet the prerequisites to create an entirely custom Z-Splat IC, per the rules given in the respective books, as your character is creating it themself. There will be NO exceptions to this.%0a**Creating a custom Z-splat uses up your custom power creation for the month, and may not be submitted alongside other custom things.%0a**If the Z-Splat has custom powers of some kind, you’ll need a Justification for each dot of said powers, but these can be spread out over the course of you buying them. %0a**Lodges specifically need at least 2 founding members, as there’s no way to attract a powerful enough Totem (Rank 2+) without at least that many people.%0a**Entitlements will use the rules in the Chapter 3 document until we update them, but only need 2 people to form the initial Oath for a new one. %0a%0a[[#to1]]%0a%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25vampire%25'''Bloodlines'''%25%25%0a%0aThe following bloodlines from Onyx Path blogs are available:%0a*[[http://theonyxpath.com/the-jaws-of-the-beast/|Kerberoi]]%0a*[[http://theonyxpath.com/the-shadow-and-the-asp/|Khaibit]]%0a*[[http://theonyxpath.com/lonely-together/|Neglatu]]%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Dead Wolves''%0a%0a''You call yourselves a Pack?''%0a%0aThroughout the world, Kindred and Uratha mingle. Not every city, of course, has more than a handful of either, and even those populated by both will sometimes have their populations kept apart by fear, xenophobia, or perhaps just silent agreements. But in nearly every nation both can be found, you’ll find a few together. An Iron Master who’s taken to studying the local Kindred, both seeking out parallels with humanity and how they themselves interact with the human herd. The Mekhet who’s learned of the spirits by silently and respectfully watching from the side as an old friend’s pack performs their rites. A Bone Shadow seeking a strange form of insight by sacrificing his prey over an Acolyte’s altar. %0a%0aAnd of course, the Dead Wolf running with the Pack.%0a%0a!!!!Background%0a*“''This Story is True''. They say that before the blood reacts beneath the auspice moon, it’s as malleable as any human’s. You can be killed and risen as some zombie, permanently merged with a spirit, or even Embraced by one of our kind. Our founder, if you can call him by such a formal-sounding title, was chosen by Luna, but before his change, his blood was claimed by a Savage who’d taken on a bane forcing her into frenzy any time the full moon shone down upon her. He was just the one that was unlucky enough to be in her path when it did, but somehow, her Beast chose not to kill, but to reproduce, and she did it right in Luna’s face.”%0a*“''This Story is True''. You know of the firstborn, Urdur, those known to take on the mantle of our tribes, those children of Father Wolf that came before any others. They became the patrons of our Tribes and that of our… less wise cousins, and are spoken of in countless tales. But Father Wolf’s spirit children were not the only his essence found its way into. Some few say that he sired another, a wolf formed not of ephemera, but the essence of darkness itself, recognizable by yellow eyes among a body that’s otherwise nothing more than Shadow. It refuses patronage to those few of the People that have sought it out, but some say it’s granted a blessing to others…”%0a*“Yeah, what do they call ‘em, the fuckin’ Dead Wolves? I heard a story about ‘em. One o’ ours, some Mexican guy, I don’ know his name, they say he found his way into some spirit realm, or whatever shit the acolytes are always talkin’ about. Came across his Beast, but like, some creepy haunted version of it, and it, uh, whaddya call it, possessed him, like the damned owls do? And merged with him. But he didn’ lose control. For some reason, grabbed the attention of those lupine guys, and it all broke down from there. No, I don’t fuckin’ know if the story’s true!”  %0a%0a!!!!The Becoming%0a%0aThe Dead Wolves are most prevalent in northern Mexico, where the Uratha and Kindred have formed more substantive ties, and thus are less wary about getting close to each other, but despite what many think, the Dead Wolves don’t NEED to have ties with the Uratha. Still, allies or contacts among the Forsaken (or other Werewolves) are common, and those that already have a connection to them are most likely to be noticed and chosen by those of the bloodline, whether to become a Childe in the first place or simply to be brought closer beneath an Avus’ tutelage.%0a%0a:Requirements:%0a%0aThe Dead Wolves are Gangrel, the Savages being the only Kindred that truly understand the form the Beast takes, and thus have the unique ability to shape it to match that which dwells within the soul of the Uratha.%0a%0a:Clan: Gangrel%0a%0a:Interactions With the Danse:%0a%0aUnsurprisingly, in areas where tensions between Kindred and Uratha are high or at least far short of allegiance, but where there’s still communication, a position often forms as a sort of ambassador (when most respected) or message-carrier (when not so well thought of) between the Kindred and the local Werewolves. Dead Wolves, of course, are uniquely suited to such roles, and often serve them even if not made to do so in a formal manner. %0aBeyond that, the Circle likely harbors the highest number of them, followed, oddly enough, by the Sanctified. The Ordo Dracul and Carthians are probably next most likely, for the sake of studying their mixed condition in the former case or simply due to the ‘looser’ structure of the latter fitting them better. The Invictus very rarely take on those of this bloodline, but it’s not entirely unheard of. %0a%0a:Nickname: Wolf-Blooded (confusing as that may be among Uratha society)%0a%0a:Bloodline Bane:%0a%0aThe Dead Wolves take on a mirrored aspect of Luna’s influence, and so find themselves vulnerable to the substance that resonates most harshly with her children: silver. At Humanity 6, all Dead Wolves take on Repulsion (Silver) as a bane, though may choose a form of Detachment to stave off as normal, but it inherently counts against the limits of three banes either way.%0a%0aIn addition, those that have aligned with a Pack of Uratha find that their Beast resonates with their distant cousins’. They gain a “Trigger” for their Beast’s frenzy, similarly to a Uratha’s Kuruth trigger, but automatically aligned to The Pack. Whenever they see a member of their Pack harmed (with at least lethal damage), they must roll to resist frenzy. If the roll fails, their Beast will ALWAYS take on their Predatory Aspect, if they know that discipline, but this only applies to frenzy triggered through the Pack. %0a%0a:Bloodline Disciplines: Animalism, Protean, Resilience, ''Vigor''%0a%0a!!!!Bloodline Gift: Sublunario%0a%0aSublunario, the gift of the Dead Wolves, is a manifestation of both Luna’s influence on her Undead children, and the aspects of the Wolf they’ve taken on through their blood. This provides them with a small array of benefits that becomes more potent when the Dead Wolf is part of a Pack.%0a*All Dead Wolves have a Tell, chosen from those that the Wolf-Blooded have access to, whether they shared the blood of the Uratha in life or not. In addition, they may buy Wolf-Blooded merits if they don’t rely on any trait the Kindred doesn’t have (such as Integrity). %0a*Given their spiritual ties, Dead Wolves may purchase the Totem merit if part of a pack (whether a Pack in Werewolf terms, Gangrel terms, or both). The Totem provides the normal benefits, but cannot grant traits Vampires are normally incapable of gaining (such as certain merits) to Kindred. %0a*Dead Wolves treat their Blood Potency multiplied by two as effective Renown for calculating effective Spirit Rank, and may spend a point of Vitae to “flare” their spiritual might similar to a Uratha’s brand, treating their natural Blood Potency divided by 2 (round up) as the effective rating, for the purposes of any respect accorded. This grants Dead Wolves the “Proven“ condition. %0a%0a!!!!!Proven%0aYour character is a Proven member of the People, despite having a Kindred’s Beast instead of an inner Wolf. She’s integrated, shown her strength, and can hold her own against the more natural born hunters she stands among. Those Uratha that know of this often feel the need to see for themselves just how well she can withstand their world. Any rolls to test the character’s strength, loyalty, or right to be among the Uratha gains a +2 bonus, but doing so often simply reinforces her right to be there. %0a:Possible Sources: A Dead Wolf flaring their Blood Potency by spending Vitae.%0a:Resolution: After at least one Uratha character, or a character that’s knowingly a part of one’s pack, has taken advantage of the +2 bonus, you may shed this condition. In doing so, you may add your character’s Blood Potency divided by 2 (round up) as automatic successes to a social roll among the Uratha, or to a roll utilizing one of the skills associated with the auspice of the current moon phase. %0a%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Name of Bloodline here'' %0a%0a(Per Bloodlines the Legendary pg 51)%0a%0a!!!!Background: %0a%0a:Clan: Nosferatu%0a%0a:Interactions with the Danse: (Per Bloodlines the Legendary)%0a%0a:Nickname: Pretties%0a%0a:Bloodline Bane: More so than any other vampires, the Galloi look the part of the walking corpses they are. While not under the effects of the Blush of Life, Galloi apply the same penalties they suffer when interacting with humans to all social interactions, even with Kindred and Touchstones. This includes the penalties imposed by the Nosferatu’s Lonely Curse.%0a%0a:Bloodline Disciplines: Majesty, Nightmare, Obfuscate, Vigor%0a%0a!!!!Bloodline Gift: Taurobolium%0a%0aThe Taurobolium is a sort of cleansing ritual practiced by the Galloi, where a subject is bathed in a special concoction of herbs, oils, and perfumes. The exact recipe is a secret known only to the members of the bloodline, but there is one ingredient that is very well known – blood. Any character who is bathed in this special mixture, along with at least one point of the pretty’s own Vitae, is cleansed of all blemishes, scars, and other unsightly marks; for a number of nights equal to the Galloi’s Blood Potency, the anointed character’s skin becomes as flawless as porcelain. A living subject appears younger – regardless of his actual age, he looks to be in the prime of his life for as long as the Taurobolium’s invigoration lasts. A Kindred subject retains his apparent age, but benefits from the effects of the Blush of Life for the duration instead.%0a%0aA Galloi can also learn Devotions that add other, additional effects to the Taurobolium. Each such Devotion has a Vitae cost, which must be added to the bath in addition to the point spent for the basic effects. The first Devotion, Enliven the Flesh, is free, learned automatically as a benefit of joining the Bloodline. Additional Devotions cost 2 experiences each, and have a prerequisite Discipline, which the Galloi must possess at 2 dots or higher in order to learn the Devotion.%0a%0a!!!!!Enliven the Flesh%0aThe Galloi can add one additional point of her Vitae into the bath to magnify the subject’s natural beauty, granting him one dot of Striking Looks. If the subject already had Striking Looks, this Devotion increases it to two dots. If the subject already had two dots, he gains a third dot. These Merits are not protected by the Sanctity of Merits rule, and are lost when the effects of the Tarubolium end.%0a%0a!!!!!Blessing of the Captive Eye%0aWith this Devotion, the Galloi can spend a point of Willpower when performing the Tarubolium to grant a living subject the benefits of the Lost Visage, or take those benefits away from a Kindred subject. This effect lasts for as long as the subject’s appearance is altered by the Taurobolium.%0a:Prerequisite: Obfuscate &#159;&#159;2%0a%0a!!!!!Cybele’s Terrible Beauty%0aAt the cost of an additional point of Vitae, the Galloi can grant the subject of the Taurobolium an imposing air until the Taurobolium’s effects wear off. Onlookers are intimidated by the subject’s sheer immaculacy and become flustered when interacting with him, they must make a roll of composure + supernatural tolerance - Pretty's nightmare, and upon a fail reducing their effective Composure by 2 dots for the duration of the scene.%0a:Prerequisite: Nightmare &#159;&#159;2%0a%0a!!!!!Consent of the Magna Mater%0aThe Galloi with this Devotion can add one additional point of Vitae to the Taurobolium to bless its creations with unnatural adoration. When a subject, which must be a creation of the Galloi, is viewed by another i before the Taurobolium’s effects wear off, they must make a roll of composure+supernatural tolerance - Majesty of the Galloi or take the Swooning condition towards both the subject and the Galloi that created them. %0a: Prerequisite: majesty &#159;&#159;2%0a%0a!!!!!Transgression of Attis%0aBy adding two additional Vitae into the Taurobolium, the Galloi can use this devotion to change the subject’s sex. This change is anatomically and physiologically complete, including reproductive organs, hormones, and bone structure. This change normally fades when the effects of Tarubolium wear off, but the subject can spend a point of Willpower to make the change permanent if they so desire.%0a:Prerequisite: Vigor &#159;&#159;2%0a%0a%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Name of Bloodline here'' %0a%0aFill out the introduction with what the bloodline is about and their goals and driving force.

At the end of the night there just wasn’t any doubt of the outcome.''%0a%0aThe lodge itself is not very big and it doesn’t help that the Uratha are divided amongst themselves when it comes to the embassy and the accords, nevertheless this lodge was born out of a desire to promote and secure the position of the Uratha of the tribes of the moon as a faction on the embassy of Portland, though less known too it’s that they also are on the lookout of the possibility of another war being waged and work both to ensure that it doesn’t happen or failing that, that the Uratha come on top of it. One of the things that they focus though is understanding the others supernatural denizens of the city and also networking with the different factions, “keep your friends close and your enemies closer” rings truth and chiefly among them, though who they consider friends and enemies is not something they openly discuss, they do lend themselves to hunting down threats to the embassy when asked or sometimes even when not, giving them a reputation of helpful hunters at best and meddlers at worst.%0a%0aThey draw members from any tribe so long as they aligns themselves with embassy accords, they have a preference on Elodoths and Irraka over the other auspices, drawing on the ease these two auspices have when talking with others for either securing cooperation or drawing secrets out of them. %0a%0aOn the hunt they are not that different from any other werewolves, they do bring however a considerable network of contacts and allies into play when the hunt takes them away from their own territory and are forced through unfamiliar territory, they have a better time avoiding stepping on toes when it does happen and thanks to keeping good or just cordial relationships with the others can in a limited fashion piggy ride on the work the others have done on their territory for their advantage provided they don’t abuse the privilege.%0a%0aTo that end, their given word is specially binding to them, what they agree to they will make sure to fulfill to the best of their abilities, following both the letter and the spirit of the contract they bind themselves to, the accords being one such contract it holds a great deal of importance to them, on the other hand because of this oath breakers are hold on special contempt by lodge members and weaseling out of a deal it’s grounds for a formal challenge or demands of reparation and they have a surprisingly easy time spotting when someone is doing just that or just lying to their face.%0a%0a:Requirements: Must be Pro-Embassy/Accords%0a%0a!!!!Totem: The Witness of the Pact%0a%0aThe Witness of the Pact is a spirit born when the Uratha banded together and the war started to take its toll on the werewolves packs on the city, it pledged its support then because the wolves needed a unifying force and it grew on strength while they remained united, though because of its ban it eventually grew weary of them when they gave their word to the Lost and chose to break it when failing to fulfill their end of the bargain.%0a%0aThe spirit however has not forgotten where it came from and stills wishes to honor the alliance it had with the Uratha of the city, with the signing of the accords it forces its lodge members to abide by them but also be on guard when it comes to traitors and oath breakers lets it’s them that end up paying the price, it preaches honesty but not to the point of stupidity, it acknowledges the need for secrecy as well.%0a%0aNowadays it has grown with the influence of the embassy and the essence it distills from the peacekeeping done among the factions and while it has ties to the embassy it’s primarily bound and contracted with the werewolves.%0a%0a!!!!Lodge Bonds %0a:Blessing: The lodge members enjoy the condition Connected (Embassy/Accords) and once per month you can spend a willpower point to get it back if they have burned it or otherwise resolved it, it also allows them to buy pack tactics that take others into account and use them at the cost of +&#9679; if they are packmates (storytellers at the final arbiters of what applies to non-werewolf members when it comes to pack tactics) non packmates don't count even if they have been added with facets like Pack Triumphs Together. It’s still required that they practice and train on the use of the tactics for at least a month to master them but at the end it allows the Uratha to subtly read the cues of his non werewolf allies and react accordingly to whatever tactic they are trying to pull off.%0a:Aspiration: Promoting and securing the Uratha position in the Embassy%0a:Ban: Never willing break your given oaths.\\%0aCasually given word won’t trigger the ban, but a formal promise will, the important thing is the intent behind the promise, and as the ban says the character must do everything in its power to keep his word, however if happenstance or just bad luck is what forces an oath to be broken it doesn’t trigger the ban.%0a%0a:The Sacred Hunt: On the sacred hunt they can chose to benefit from any territorial merits, rite or gifts they have so long as they are hunting on an Embassy managed territory, it doesn’t apply when hunting on territory that no one manages or that are either neutral or against the embassy and disrespecting others territory can count as a breaking point towards spirit while being a guest.%0a%0a!!!!Tools%0a%0aMembers of the lodge can make use of the Lodge Armory, Lodge Lorehouse and Lodge Connections merit when it comes to the network of the Embassy faction.%0a %0a:Five Talons of the Claw (Fetish &#9679;&#9679;&#9679;):%0aThe fetish is made of five claws that are handed over to the beneficiaries of it.\\%0aEffect: As per the facet Lead the Lesser Pack (WtF.

They tend to be more apt to ritually cast, using sigils and circles that can take some time to prepare. Ritual Circle (+2): Whether salt, sulfer or chalk, a circle denotes the eternal continuation of cycles, the old becoming the new, and vice versa. Any power using a ritual circle ends if the circle is broken, or the caster steps outside of it.%0a:Oblations: Prayer to spirits or other beings, ceremonies meant to celebrate old traditions. Generally speaking done with either a roll of Wits+Occult, or Presence+Occult, depending on the styling of the ritual. Telling inspiring stories of the old ways: Presence+Expression/occult%0a%0a!!!!Attainments%0a%0a!!!!!First Attainment: Understanding the Katsina%0a:Prerequisite: Initiation\\%0aThe Caretaker’s frst and most important revelation is the nature of her spirit guide; an incarnation of the Primal Wild whose nature most powerfully resonates with the mage’s own. This “spirit” (which is an archetypal ideal, rather than an individual entity) is an animal, elemental manifestation, plant, or something of the sort: coyotes, bears, ravens, mountains, streams, storms, cacti, or cedar trees, for example. When seen in Shadow, the mage possesses features reminiscent of the spirit guide. The player and Storyteller should work together to determine an appropriate spirit guide for the Caretaker.\\%0aWhen activating this attainment, the Mage becomes able to see, hear, and speak with spirits for a couple turns at a time (per transitory duration), though this may be continually re-activated during a conversation to allow for 'uninterrupted' perception.%0a%0a%0a!!!!!Second Attainment: Veil of the Katsina%0a:Prerequisite: Spirit 2\\%0aAs connections grow between the Caretaker and their Guide, they begin to realize how to protect themselves from spiritual predation. They internalize the Ephemeral Shield spell, allowing them to activate it with a short ritual to gain its protection for the day.%0a%0a!!!!!Third Attainment: Calling the Katsina%0a:Prerequisite: Spirit 3\\%0aThe Caretaker grows closer to oneness with her spirit guide, embracing its metaphysical qualities. The mage’s Primal connection grants her an Influence (as per spirit In&#64258;uences, on pp. 258-259 of Mage: The Awakening and Werewolf: The Forsaken page 187) with a descriptor identical to the nature of her guide, at a rating equal to half her Gnosis, rounding down. (In other words, a Gnosis 4 willworker who identifes with the wolf gains an In&#64258;uence of Wolves at two dots, while one with a Gnosis 8 whose spirit guide embodies rain gains an In&#64258;uence of Rain at four dots.) The mage rolls Gnosis + Spirit to use this In&#64258;uence and spends points of Mana in place of Essence, on a one-for-one basis. %0a%0a!!!!!Fourth Attainment: Becoming the Katsina%0a:Prerequisite: Spirit 4\\%0aWith this Attainment, the Caretaker acquires the ability to temporarily physically incarnate certain of the qualities of his spirit guide, calling its ideal down from the Primal Wild and into himself, and becoming something halfway between spirit and &#64258;esh. By activating this attainment, the character becomes able to cross the Gauntlet as if with the spell Reaching with the Reach spent, forming an Iris that lasts for about a turn. They may also activate it without the Reach to become able to interact physically with the other side of the Gauntlet for up to a month at a time.%0a%0a:Optional Arcana: Life 4\\%0aAs an instant action, the Mage may take on effects appropriate to their spirit guide, akin to the Transform Life spell, with a number of features gained equal to the Mage's Life Arcanum. This lasts for up to a day at a time. As well, the Mage may gain access to these features automatically (for the same duration) upon activating the base attainment to interact with the other side of the Gauntlet (as that closeness draws their spirit guide in more easily).%0a%0a!!!!!Fifth Attainment: Purity of Destruction%0a:Prerequisite: Spirit 5\\%0aAt this level of understanding, the Caretaker understands that even those who try to meld the old with the new, must sometimes cut out a cancer before it has time to spread. Those that advance to this highest of levels are able to Annihilate Spirits at will, though they tend to use this power sparingly... This power is used more often after every other option has been exhausted, and tends to even then, only be used sparingly, as spirits tend to shy away from those with the power to end their very existence completely. This will affect any spirit up to Rank 5, and the Mage gains a number of successes on the ensuing Clash of Wills equal to their Spirit rating.%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Lords of the Inanimate''%0a%0aThe practitioners of this Legacy understand everything in the Fallen World has a voice, if%0aonly one knows how to listen well enough. Moreover, they can do more than listen to the%0avoices of the objects around them, they can also command the objects to do their bidding.%0aTheir ability to command the inanimate world comes with a far deeper understanding of and%0asympathy for the objects and devices around them. Once they have the ability to do so, most%0aLords of the Inanimate permanently awaken the spirits of the objects and devices they used%0amost often. As a result, many have spiritually awakened houses, cars, computers, and%0aoccasionally cell phones or handguns.%0a%0a!!!!Origins%0a%0a:Parentage: Thyrsus, Silver Ladder%0a%0a:Background: Many Animists work with their hands, building or repairing objects. Those%0awho don’t are usually part of some profession that involves interacting with objects in a%0aprecise and careful fashion. Members include everything from individuals who authenticate%0aor restore valuable antiques to archaeologists and even chefs. Members of this Legacy%0acome from all social classes and professions but are united by the attention they pay to the%0aobjects and devices they use as part of their daily lives. They also tend to be highly physical%0aand even sensual individuals who enjoy physically experiencing the world around them.%0aMembers who do not work with their hands extensively in their chosen professions almost%0aalways enjoy hobbies where they do so.%0a%0a:Appearance: Animists pay close attention to all the goods they regularly use. Regardless of%0awhether they prefer rugged outdoor clothing or expensive and fancy suits, all their clothes%0aare well-made and maintained. Few Animists would consider purchasing shoddy or ill-made%0agoods or goods that will wear out quickly. They prefer to have time to develop a close%0arelationship with their possessions. Animists are also unusually careful in the way they use%0aobjects and avoid slamming doors or otherwise harshly using objects unless it is necessary.%0aIn stories about Animists Told by other mages, the followers of this Legacy regularly talk to%0athe objects and devices they use, and some mages watch Animists closely to see whether%0athey are actually whispering or listening to their wristwatches or pocketknives. In reality, only%0aa few of the most eccentric Animists talk to objects when not in private or using the%0aAttainments of their Legacy. Instead, to avoid being seen as deeply eccentric and potentially%0aeven unbalanced, the vast majority of Animists are far more discrete. However, most touch%0aand sometimes even caress the objects they use; often rewarding a well-functioning object%0ain much the same manner a dog owner would pet a dog that performed a trick particularly%0awell.\\%0aMany Animists are exceedingly knowledgeable about the various sorts of objects and%0adevices they regularly use and can go on at great length about the relative merits of different%0acell phones, cars, computers or different brands of tools. However, most are also at least%0amoderately socially adept and understand at least the basics of how not to bore or annoy%0athose to whom they are talking.%0a%0a!!!!Doctrine%0a%0a:Prerequisites: Matter 2, Persuasion 2, Crafts 1%0a%0a:Initiation: The applicant must present at a Conclave (see below) an object of excellent%0aquality that they have crafted themselves by ‘hand’ - meaning that mundane tools are%0aallowed but using magic to shape them is not. The creation is judged by a panel of Lords,%0awho also take the opinion of the object’s spirit into consideration.%0a:Organization: Some Animists get along better with the spirits of their favorite objects than%0awith other humans, including other mages, and many have little time for formal ceremonies%0aor bureaucracy. As a result, Animists have a fairly loose organization, where members keep%0ain touch on a moderately informal basis. In the past decade, this trend has been further%0aexacerbated by the fact that an increasing number of Animists are rousing the spirits of their%0acell phones and answering machines and having them screen calls and deal with most%0acallers like an especially skilled 24-hour secretary.\\%0aIn most cases, Animists are connected to one another by ties of personal friendship, with%0athose who are well liked or respected by their fellows having far more contact with other%0amembers of this Legacy. The only exception to this loose and informal contact is during the%0aLegacy’s yearly Conclave. Held in a different city each year, this Conclave is a chance for%0amembers to meet, for individuals who wish to become members to attempt to convince an%0aAnimist to teach them, and for the various Animists to show off the various spirits with which%0athey are working.\\%0aWith an atmosphere somewhere between an academic conference, a high-end craft fair and%0aa dog show, Conclaves are chaotic events wherein members report about interesting or%0aunusual applications of their abilities. The most chaotic and prestigious part of the Conclave%0aconsists of the more experienced members showing off objects whose spirits they have%0aawakened. In addition, Animists also discuss and demonstrate ways they have found to be%0aable to work in tandem with their spirits. As noted, the Conclave is also where prospective%0amembers can attempt to convince an Animist to teach them. This in-person contact is%0acrucial, because many Animists decide whether those prospective members are worthy to%0ajoin this Legacy by watching them interact with the objects around them.%0a%0a!!!!Magic%0a%0a:Ruling Arcana: Arcana Type%0a:Yantras: Carrying out maintenance on an object (+1), building an object from scratch using%0ayour hands (+2 when using machines that are powered by the users own muscles, +1 with%0apower tools), laying out plans or scale models, e.g. technical drawing, knitting pattern (+2).%0a:Oblations: Polishing or caring for tools and equipment, knitting, carving or performing other%0ahandcrafts, selecting materials for use in some craft project.%0a%0a!!!!Attainments%0a%0a!!!!!First Attainment: Commanding the Inanimate%0a:Prerequisite: Initiation%0aThe Mage can control mechanical%0aand electrical objects in a fashion%0asimilar to Remote Control (MtA,%0ap155) simply by conversing with it.%0aObjects perform the requests%0amade of them with a maximum dice%0apool of the Mage’s Matter dots.%0a%0a:Optional: Spirit 1%0aThe Mage may address the spirit of an object%0adirectly, as per the spell Exorcist’s Eye (MtA, p180).%0a%0a!!!!!Second Attainment: Exalting the Form%0a:Prerequisite: Matter 2, Crafts 2%0aObjects are inclined to work more efficiently when in the%0ahand of a Lord of the Inanimate. A tool gains the 9-%0aAgain quality as per Find the Balance (MtA, p155).%0a%0a:Optional: Spirit 2%0aThe Mage may transfer Essence to or from the spirit%0aof an object in a fashion similar to Channel Essence%0a(MtA, p180). If channelling to a spirit, the Mage is%0arestricted only by their Gnosis-derived Mana per%0aturn rate. The Mage cannot take Essence from a%0aspirit against their will using this Attainment - they must either have persuaded it or placated it through some other obligation.%0a%0a!!!!!Third Attainment: Shepherd of the Craft%0a:Prerequisites: Matter 3, Persuasion 3%0aWith a touch, the Mage restores a number of Structure%0apoints to a damaged object equal to their dots in Matter.%0aAt the STs discretion this may also provide a bonus to%0afurther negotiations with the object’s spirit.%0a%0a:Optional: Spirit 3%0aThe Mage may also heal the spirit of that object, restoring two boxes of bashing damage for%0aeach dot of Spirit the Mage possesses.%0a%0a!!!!!Fourth Attainment: Name%0a:Prerequisite: Matter 4, Crafts 3%0aThe Mage can grant an object a semblance of life and allow it autonomous movement. The%0aAttainment does not grant physical features that the object does not already possess - a%0ahumanoid statue could serve drinks or fight enemies, but an animated car can only steer%0aitself and open its own doors.\\%0aThis Attainment effectively grants the Mage dots in Retainer equal to their dots in Matter as%0aper Golem (MtA 158). The Mage may elect to renew the duration of at any time before the%0acurrent duration expires, but must be present with the servant to do so.%0a%0a:Optional: Spirit 4%0aThe Mage has the power to grant sentience and self-awareness to an object’s spirit. In%0aaddition to the animation granted above, the Mage may enter into a conversation with the%0aspirit (at least for the length of their Ritual Interval) and use Rouse Spirit (MtA, p182) with%0aAdvanced Duration on the object. For a cost of 1 Mana the effect can be made Indefinite.%0a%0a!!!!!Fifth Attainment: Name%0a:Prerequisite: Matter 5, Persuasion 4%0aAs a person now befitting the title of Lord, the Mage can now reshape matter to their will. By%0atouching an object and speaking gently to it, they may vastly reconfigure an object to any%0adesign.\\%0aThe Mage can reshape Matter in any form as per the Shaping spell (MtA, p156), with Reach%0areducing the required successes for creating intricate shapes by their dots in Matter and%0agranting the ability to shape solid matter. This includes intricate mechanisms and moving%0aparts - the Mage may change a hunk of steel into a complex gear-driven mechanism, for%0aexample. For a cost of 1 Mana, the Mage may affect an object up to Size 15.%0a%0a:Optional: Spirit 5%0aWith their grandest Attainment, a Lord of the Inanimate may reshape an ephemeral being as%0aeasily as solid matter. As per the Shape Spirit spell (MtA, p184), they may invoke a number%0aof effects equal to their dots in Spirit with the option of healing Aggravated damage with%0aMana on a one-for-one basis. The effects use the Advanced Duration Factors and the Mage%0amust converse with the spirit for a minimum of their Ritual Interval.%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Perfected Adepts''%0a%0a!!!!Origins%0a%0a:Parentage: Obrimos or Adamantine Arrow%0a%0a(Background and History are as presented in Mage 1e, page 349)%0a%0a!!!!Doctrine%0a%0a:Prerequisites: Life 2, Athletics 2, 2 dots in Brawl or Weaponry%0a%0a(Initiation as per Mage 1e)%0a%0a!!!!Magic%0a%0a:Ruling Arcana: Life%0a:Yantras: Rigorous Workout to focus the mind (+2), Meditate into a State of Peace (+2), Disregard Worldly Concerns in Pursuit of the Spell (+1, +2 if it imposes a Negative Condition)%0a:Oblations: Rigorous Martial Arts Practice, Extended Meditations, Exhibiting Humility%0a%0a!!!!Attainments%0a%0a!!!!!First Attainment: Chi Sight%0a:Prerequisite: Initiation\\%0aWith but a glance (and an instant action), the Monk can focus on the energies in a living thing call Chi or Prana, and discern information about the body it is contained within. This includes all information as per the spell Analyze Life including health, sex, species, age, conditions, tilts, and physical attribute dots. To focus on another individual, the mage must use this Attainment again. (As Per Life 1 Analyze Life)%0a%0a:Optional Arcanum: Forces 1\\%0aLearning to use his Chi to subtly enhance his own actions, the Monk is able to run a little faster, jump a little further, or lift a little more. The total distance (in yards) covered on a jump, the subject’s swimming and running Speed, and any climbing or lifting rolls gain a bonus of +1. Actions are also less strenuous when moving so efficiently.The Monk gains a +1 bonus on rolls to resist fatigue. (as per Forces 1, Kinetic Efficiency)%0a%0a%0a!!!!!Second Attainment: Body Temple%0a:Prerequisite: Life 2\\%0aAs long as the Monk practices his daily (ritual) exercise regimen, he maintains full control over his normally autonomous bodily functions, with effects identical to the Life 2 Body Control spell. (Ritual Cast, Advanced Duration)%0a%0a:Optional Arcanum: Forces 2\\%0aMore attuned to the subtle changes in temperature, vibration, and all the other minor variations in the forms of energy surrounding her that are often ignored, the Monk becomes able to intuitively feel as well as see forms of electromagnetic radiation, sound, and kinetic energies, allowing her to operate without penalty in complete darkness, and ignore any penalties from the Blindness or Deafness Tilts or Conditions. She can still see and hear and make out details, even in the dark, although colors and tones are somewhat muted. This increased sensitivity does make the Monk more vulnerable to bright lights and loud noises, which may inflict penalties equal to the Blindness condition. (As per Forces 1 Nightvision, Advanced Duration)%0a%0a!!!!!Third Attainment: Chi Force%0a:Prerequisite: Life 3\\%0aThe Monk’s constant exercise regimen has granted him an unparalleled physique, permitting him to channel his chi into it to enhance the potency of musculature, suppleness of ligaments, or rigidity and durability of his frame. So long as the Monk maintains his daily exercise regimen, he may, each day, increase one attribute by his dots in Life for the remainder of the scene up to his normal maximum. (As per Life 3 Honing the Form, Ritual Cast, Advanced Duration)%0a%0a:Optional Arcana: Forces 3\\%0aThe Monk’s Chi can be channeled into more than his mere form, but can be projected out of his form in the manner of kinetic energy. With an instant action, the Monk may channel his chi into his melee attacks, increasing damage and turning it from Bashing into Lethal. Furthermore, any successful attack causes ripples of chi to pass directly through the subject disorientating them and applying the Stunned tilt. (As per Forces 2 Kinetic Strike, Spell Specific Reach)%0a%0a!!!!!Fourth Attainment: Inviolate Form%0a:Prerequisite: Life 4\\%0aThe Monk may channel his Chi within himself or another to heal damage, as per Life 4 Mend.%0a%0a:Optional Arcana: Forces 4\\%0aChanneling his Chi around himself the Monk is able to use it to redirect objects that would otherwise strike him. As an Instant Action, the Monk can focus his chi about him; thereafter as a reflexive action he can redirect a number of objects each round equal to his dots in Forces. These must all be of size 5 or less and the monk cannot redirect them unless he could apply his Defense. However, this effect does function against even individuals, allowing the Monk to deflect melee attacks. (As per Forces 3 Turn Momentum, Spell Specific Reach)%0a%0a!!!!!Fifth Attainment: Perfect Body%0a:Prerequisite: Life 5\\%0aAs per the previous attainment, Chi Force, but the Monk may choose two physical attributes to enhance, and he may increase either or both above his normal maximum. (As per Life 3 Honing the Form, Ritual Cast, Advanced Duration, Spell Specific Reaches +2)    %0a%0a:Optional Arcana: Forces 5\\%0aWith an instant action, and a point of Mana, the Monk is able to release his Chi as bolts of pure energy in an aimed attack, doing aggravated damage equal to his Forces dots. (As per Forces 4 Thunderbolt, Spell Specific Reach)%0a%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''The Quiescent''%0a%0aThe Quiescent started as a philosophical movement borne from the aftermath of the Second%0aWorld War, where the Awakened saw just how much Sleeper technology has moved on. The%0aQuiet philosophy asks its adherents to working of magic within the limits of the Fallen World,%0awithin what the Quiescence already draws the line for. Already prone to drawing suspicion from%0aother Awakened, especially that they were Seer fronts, the Legacy lost what tenuous contact it%0amaintained with the larger Awakened society when one of their founders turned Banisher and%0astarted hunting them down.%0a%0aThe Quiet philosophy was largely a product of the 1940s and the 1950s, and when the zeitgeist%0agave way so did the Legacy's main appeal. However, the Liars were always good with keeping%0atheir heads down from the authorities, especially with a murderous Banisher on their trails, and%0aa few Quiet cabals have survived to the modern era. With the advent of communications and%0asocial media technology, there have even been mages who reinvented the Quiet philosophy in%0athe modern age to better hide from prying Sleeper eyes, some of which have successfully%0ainherited the Quiescents' old mantle.%0a%0a!!!!Origins%0a%0a:Parentage: Moros, Guardians of the Veil or Nameless%0a:Background&#8203;: The original Liars drew from war veterans, or those who were affected by the%0aWorld War in one way. They were often comfortable with illegal, if not criminal activities, for the%0aLegacy's founders felt morality less important to their own behavioral code over magic, and%0amorality is best taken in moderation after seeing what horrors a moral man can do. While%0amodern Liars aren't so familiar with war, they are still adept at evading the law and working in%0agrey zones, especially when it comes to avoiding scrutiny.%0a:Appearances&#8203;: Quiescent mages live on the fringe of society, where they can fade into the%0abackground easily. This is easier in the modern era, where big cities that allow such are plenty.%0aLiars dress simply as expected, and get on by with whatever work they find. Many do find work%0aas investigators, or any other occupation where their skills would be needed.%0a%0a!!!!Doctrine%0a%0a:Prerequisites: Time 2, Science 2, two dots in one of the following Skills; Investigation, Stealth,%0aBrawl, Intimidation, Streetwise%0a%0a:Initiation&#8203;: The Legacy draws exclusively from practitioners of Quiet Magic, and even then it's%0ausually the practitioner seeking them out than the Legacy approaching her. In the applicant's%0apursuit the elder Liars judge her ability and character, seeing if she can find them with minimal%0areliance on magic and on others' help.%0a%0a:Organization&#8203;: The Quiescent are one of the most diffused Legacies, the Legacy offering no%0agreater organization to fall back on to and leaving each Liar on their own. The mentor severs%0aregular contact when his pupil learns the Attainment she was calling to him to help on, and the%0apupil likewise moves on until she deems herself progressed enough for the next Attainment.%0a%0a:Theory&#8203;: The Quiescent do not think of the Quiescence as a Lie to be challenged, but just%0aanother principle of Supernal magic that can be worked through and around. They believe that it%0aexists to protect Sleepers from the Awakened so that they may progress without intervention.%0aFurthermore, they believe Quiescence also protect the Awakened from Sleepers so that they%0amay work lesser but more stable wonders, free from Dissonance.%0a%0a!!!!Magic%0a%0a:Ruling Arcana: Time%0a:Yantras: Streets and alleys filled with non-descript buildings (+1); quietly observing the subject%0a(+1); investigatory tools such as magnifiers (+1); confronting but not appearing in front of the%0asubject (+1, +2 if managing the confrontation without verbal interaction)%0a:Oblations&#8203;: Menial chores such as cleaning; solving a puzzle; mixing drinks; shadowing a%0aSleeper or a group of them%0a%0a!!!!Attainments%0a%0a!!!!!First Attainment: No Mistake%0a:Prerequisite: Initiation%0aThe Liar wishes not to disturb the Quiet, so she learns to tread carefully. This Attainment divines%0awhether the subject's next Supernal spell will provoke Quiescence with a "Yes" or "No" answer,%0aessentially being a limited version of the "Divination" spell with Reach assigned to instant use.%0a:Optional Arcana: Death 1%0aProvocation of Quiescence and the taint of Paradox tend to go hand in hand, and the Silencer%0alearns to pick up signs telling whether his subject is willing to be Quiet. This effect resembles the%0a"Soul Marks" spell, but is limited to finding out if the subject is Awakened and if she is suffering a%0aParadox Condition. Reach is assigned to instant use.\\%0aWhile Withstood by Resolve, the mage can bypass it if he uses this effect immediately after his%0asubject casts a Supernal spell.%0a%0a!!!!!Second Attainment: No Past%0a:Prerequisite: Time 2, Science 3%0aThe Liar learns to mask themselves from temporal scrutiny into their pasts. This Attainment%0aresembles the "Shield of Chronos" spell, with Reach assigned to Advanced Duration. While%0aproviding no protection over the future, the Attainment's protection over the past extends to%0amundane investigations as well. Mundane scrutiny automatically fails, and the Liar scores%0aautomatic successes equal to her Time dots on Clash of Wills provoked by magical scrutiny.\\%0aTo use this Attainment, the Liar must spend a scene ritually destroying personal belongings that%0abetray her past life, most often pictures and identification, and other items she has used%0aextensively.%0a:Optional&#8203;: Death 2%0aThe Silencer can now move subtly enough in the present that he doesn't leave a past trail that%0acould follow him. He replicates the "Without a Trace" spell, with Reach assigned to Advanced%0aDuration. The required preparation for this effect is identical to that of the Attainment's main%0aeffect, and can be taken in conjunction to enable both effects.%0a%0a!!!!!Third Attainment: No Present%0a:Prerequisite: Time 3, two dots in a second Skill among the optional prerequisite Skills%0aHiding one's past is only the first step towards hiding yourself from unwanted attention, and the%0aLiar must learn to protect her present self from unexpected encounters as well. This Attainment%0aduplicates the "Momentary Flux" spell, with Reach assigned to instant use, Advanced Duration,%0aand gaining an Initiative bonus when acting on the gleaned information.%0a:Optional&#8203;: Death 3%0aThe Quiescent is familiar with violence more than they appear to be, and a Silencer quickly%0alearns how to break things when needed to save his own skin. He emulates the "Decay" spell,%0awith Reach assigned to instant use and directly decreasing the object's Structure.%0a%0a!!!!!Fourth Attainment: No Future%0a:Prerequisite: Time 4, Science 4%0aThe Legacy was born in the uncertainty of the 1940s, with any prediction of humanity's future%0aonly a phantom. The modern era sympathizes still with that uncertainty of the future, and the%0aLiar who internalizes it can choose to shift the future to her immediate benefit. This Attainment%0areplicates the "Choose the Thread" spell, with Reach assigned to instant use and affecting%0asupernatural powers including spellcasting.%0a:Optional&#8203;: Death 4%0aA Silencer's pursuit of a Quiet life rarely leaves him with only inanimate objects in his way. He%0aduplicates the "Enervation" spell, with Reach assigned to instant use.%0a%0a!!!!!Fifth Attainment: No History%0a:Prerequisite: Time 5, two dots in a third Skill among the optional prerequisite Skills%0aNo one is perfect, and even the most dedicated of the Quiescent find themselves violating their%0aphilosophy and the Fallen World. The Liar who reaches the pinnacle of her silent reservation in%0athe status quo of the world gain the ability to amend mistakes of her own or others, changing%0ahistory itself if needed. This Attainment resembles the "Corridors of Time" spell, with Reach%0aassigned to allowing the Temporal Sympathy Attainment.\\%0aWith or without Temporal Sympathy, the Liar can only choose moments when the subject%0aprovoked Quiescence as the point of divergence, so that the subject never takes the course of%0aaction that provoked Quiescence.\\%0aTo use this Attainment, the Liar must spend a scene ritually creating a portfolio of the subject's%0alife by using objects and symbols dear to them, and ritually destroying them in their presence.%0a:Optional&#8203;: Death 5%0aThe Silencer outright destroys his own presence in the world, ensuring that he will not marr the%0aFallen World's natural progress. This effect resembles the "Empty Presence" spell, with Reach%0aassigned to Advanced Duration. Instead of violence, however, it is the provocation of%0aQuiescence that breaks the effect. The Silencer scores automatic successes equal to his Death%0adots in Clash of Wills provoked by Mage Sight or other abilities.\\%0aTo use this Attainment, the Silencer must spend a point of Mana, and follow the same%0apreparation the Attainment's main effect requires.%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25''Name of Legacy''%0a%0a!!!!Origins%0a%0a:Parentage: Path%0a%0a*Info%0a%0a!!!!Doctrine%0a%0a:Prerequisites: Info%0a%0a*Info%0a%0a!!!!Magic%0a%0a:Ruling Arcana: Arcana Type%0a:Yantras: Info%0a:Oblations: Info%0a%0a!!!!Attainments%0a%0a!!!!!First Attainment: Name%0a:Prerequisite: Info%0a*Info%0a%0a%0a!!!!!Second Attainment: Name%0a:Prerequisite: Info%0a*Info%0a%0a!!!!!Third Attainment: Name%0a:Prerequisite: Info%0a*Info%0a%0a!!!!!Fourth Attainment: Name%0a:Prerequisite: Info%0a*Info%0a%0a:Optional Arcana: Name%0a*Info%0a%0a!!!!!Fifth Attainment: Name%0a:Prerequisite: Info%0a*Info%0a%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''Entitlements'''%25%25%0a%0a%25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%0a(:include GameRef.Directoryhelp:)%0a%0aThe Storytelling System, Beast the Primordial, Changeling the Lost, Chronicles of Darkness, Demon the Descent, Mage the Awakening, Vampire the Requiem, and Werewolf the Forsaken ©2014-2016 CCP hf and published by Onyx Path Publishing.%0aProduced by Jeff Vandenberg.

Basically, what makes them tick.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Background: %0a%3c %0a%3c ''You finally nailed down where the claimed and its little cult that have been wreaking havoc on the locals are, had to buy a favor from one of the mages though, the police didn’t made things easy while they were scrambling chasing clues on the ritual killings and the Rose City Guild was too busy erasing the trail of the supernatural off the investigation to help much, though you got a lucky break when you got a  call earlier from your vampire contacts and they have managed to buy you a few hours of an uninterrupted hunt, they didn’t like it when a few of their servants ended up on the cults sacrificial altar, now you move on your neighbors turf, the claimed though to run away and has cut a swath through Lost territory but they have Embassy backing and though you not always see eye to eye they take care of their land, you can feel it on the way the old rites help you on the hunt. At the end of the night there just wasn’t any doubt of the outcome.''%0a%3c %0a%3c The lodge itself is not very big and it doesn’t help that the Uratha are divided amongst themselves when it comes to the embassy and the accords, nevertheless this lodge was born out of a desire to promote and secure the position of the Uratha of the tribes of the moon as a faction on the embassy of Portland, though less known too it’s that they also are on the lookout of the possibility of another war being waged and work both to ensure that it doesn’t happen or failing that, that the Uratha come on top of it. One of the things that they focus though is understanding the others supernatural denizens of the city and also networking with the different factions, “keep your friends close and your enemies closer” rings truth and chiefly among them, though who they consider friends and enemies is not something they openly discuss, they do lend themselves to hunting down threats to the embassy when asked or sometimes even when not, giving them a reputation of helpful hunters at best and meddlers at worst.%0a%3c %0a%3c They draw members from any tribe so long as they aligns themselves with embassy accords, they have a preference on Elodoths and Irraka over the other auspices, drawing on the ease these two auspices have when talking with others for either securing cooperation or drawing secrets out of them. %0a%3c %0a%3c On the hunt they are not that different from any other werewolves, they do bring however a considerable network of contacts and allies into play when the hunt takes them away from their own territory and are forced through unfamiliar territory, they have a better time avoiding stepping on toes when it does happen and thanks to keeping good or just cordial relationships with the others can in a limited fashion piggy ride on the work the others have done on their territory for their advantage provided they don’t abuse the privilege.%0a%3c %0a%3c To that end, their given word is specially binding to them, what they agree to they will make sure to fulfill to the best of their abilities, following both the letter and the spirit of the contract they bind themselves to, the accords being one such contract it holds a great deal of importance to them, on the other hand because of this oath breakers are hold on special contempt by lodge members and weaseling out of a deal it’s grounds for a formal challenge or demands of reparation and they have a surprisingly easy time spotting when someone is doing just that or just lying to their face.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Requirements: Must be Pro-Embassy/Accords%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Totem: The Witness of the Pact%0a%3c %0a%3c The Witness of the Pact is a spirit born when the Uratha banded together and the war started to take its toll on the werewolves packs on the city, it pledged its support then because the wolves needed a unifying force and it grew on strength while they remained united, though because of its ban it eventually grew weary of them when they gave their word to the Lost and chose to break it when failing to fulfill their end of the bargain.%0a%3c %0a%3c The spirit however has not forgotten where it came from and stills wishes to honor the alliance it had with the Uratha of the city, with the signing of the accords it forces its lodge members to abide by them but also be on guard when it comes to traitors and oath breakers lets it’s them that end up paying the price, it preaches honesty but not to the point of stupidity, it acknowledges the need for secrecy as well.%0a%3c %0a%3c Nowadays it has grown with the influence of the embassy and the essence it distills from the peacekeeping done among the factions and while it has ties to the embassy it’s primarily bound and contracted with the werewolves.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Lodge Bonds %0a%3c :Blessing: The lodge members enjoy the condition Connected (Embassy/Accords) and once per month you can spend a willpower point to get it back if they have burned it or otherwise resolved it, it also allows them to buy pack tactics that take others into account and use them at the cost of +&#9679; if they are packmates (storytellers at the final arbiters of what applies to non-werewolf members when it comes to pack tactics) non packmates don't count even if they have been added with facets like Pack Triumphs Together. It’s still required that they practice and train on the use of the tactics for at least a month to master them but at the end it allows the Uratha to subtly read the cues of his non werewolf allies and react accordingly to whatever tactic they are trying to pull off.%0a%3c :Aspiration: Promoting and securing the Uratha position in the Embassy%0a%3c :Ban: Never willing break your given oaths.\\%0a%3c Casually given word won’t trigger the ban, but a formal promise will, the important thing is the intent behind the promise, and as the ban says the character must do everything in its power to keep his word, however if happenstance or just bad luck is what forces an oath to be broken it doesn’t trigger the ban.%0a%3c %0a%3c :The Sacred Hunt: On the sacred hunt they can chose to benefit from any territorial merits, rite or gifts they have so long as they are hunting on an Embassy managed territory, it doesn’t apply when hunting on territory that no one manages or that are either neutral or against the embassy and disrespecting others territory can count as a breaking point towards spirit while being a guest.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Tools%0a%3c %0a%3c Members of the lodge can make use of the Lodge Armory, Lodge Lorehouse and Lodge Connections merit when it comes to the network of the Embassy faction.%0a%3c  %0a%3c :Five Talons of the Claw (Fetish &#9679;&#9679;&#9679;):%0a%3c The fetish is made of five claws that are handed over to the beneficiaries of it.\\%0a%3c Effect: As per the facet Lead the Lesser Pack (WtF.

While not under the effects of the Blush of Life, Galloi apply the same penalties they suffer when interacting with humans to all social interactions, even with Kindred and Touchstones. This includes the penalties imposed by the Nosferatu’s Lonely Curse.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Bloodline Disciplines: Majesty, Nightmare, Obfuscate, Vigor%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Bloodline Gift: Taurobolium%0a%3c %0a%3c The Taurobolium is a sort of cleansing ritual practiced by the Galloi, where a subject is bathed in a special concoction of herbs, oils, and perfumes. The exact recipe is a secret known only to the members of the bloodline, but there is one ingredient that is very well known – blood. Any character who is bathed in this special mixture, along with at least one point of the pretty’s own Vitae, is cleansed of all blemishes, scars, and other unsightly marks; for a number of nights equal to the Galloi’s Blood Potency, the anointed character’s skin becomes as flawless as porcelain. A living subject appears younger – regardless of his actual age, he looks to be in the prime of his life for as long as the Taurobolium’s invigoration lasts. A Kindred subject retains his apparent age, but benefits from the effects of the Blush of Life for the duration instead.%0a%3c %0a%3c A Galloi can also learn Devotions that add other, additional effects to the Taurobolium. Each such Devotion has a Vitae cost, which must be added to the bath in addition to the point spent for the basic effects. The first Devotion, Enliven the Flesh, is free, learned automatically as a benefit of joining the Bloodline. Additional Devotions cost 2 experiences each, and have a prerequisite Discipline, which the Galloi must possess at 2 dots or higher in order to learn the Devotion.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Enliven the Flesh%0a%3c The Galloi can add one additional point of her Vitae into the bath to magnify the subject’s natural beauty, granting him one dot of Striking Looks. If the subject already had Striking Looks, this Devotion increases it to two dots. If the subject already had two dots, he gains a third dot. These Merits are not protected by the Sanctity of Merits rule, and are lost when the effects of the Tarubolium end.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Blessing of the Captive Eye%0a%3c With this Devotion, the Galloi can spend a point of Willpower when performing the Tarubolium to grant a living subject the benefits of the Lost Visage, or take those benefits away from a Kindred subject. This effect lasts for as long as the subject’s appearance is altered by the Taurobolium.%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Obfuscate &#159;&#159;2%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Cybele’s Terrible Beauty%0a%3c At the cost of an additional point of Vitae, the Galloi can grant the subject of the Taurobolium an imposing air until the Taurobolium’s effects wear off. Onlookers are intimidated by the subject’s sheer immaculacy and become flustered when interacting with him, they must make a roll of composure + supernatural tolerance - Pretty's nightmare, and upon a fail reducing their effective Composure by 2 dots for the duration of the scene.%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Nightmare &#159;&#159;2%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Consent of the Magna Mater%0a%3c The Galloi with this Devotion can add one additional point of Vitae to the Taurobolium to bless its creations with unnatural adoration. When a subject, which must be a creation of the Galloi, is viewed by another i before the Taurobolium’s effects wear off, they must make a roll of composure+supernatural tolerance - Majesty of the Galloi or take the Swooning condition towards both the subject and the Galloi that created them. %0a%3c : Prerequisite: majesty &#159;&#159;2%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Transgression of Attis%0a%3c By adding two additional Vitae into the Taurobolium, the Galloi can use this devotion to change the subject’s sex. This change is anatomically and physiologically complete, including reproductive organs, hormones, and bone structure. This change normally fades when the effects of Tarubolium wear off, but the subject can spend a point of Willpower to make the change permanent if they so desire.%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Vigor &#159;&#159;2%0a%3c %0a

Moreover, they can do more than listen to the%0a%3c voices of the objects around them, they can also command the objects to do their bidding.%0a%3c Their ability to command the inanimate world comes with a far deeper understanding of and%0a%3c sympathy for the objects and devices around them. Once they have the ability to do so, most%0a%3c Lords of the Inanimate permanently awaken the spirits of the objects and devices they used%0a%3c most often. As a result, many have spiritually awakened houses, cars, computers, and%0a%3c occasionally cell phones or handguns.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Origins%0a%3c %0a%3c :Parentage: Thyrsus, Silver Ladder%0a%3c %0a%3c :Background: Many Animists work with their hands, building or repairing objects. Those%0a%3c who don’t are usually part of some profession that involves interacting with objects in a%0a%3c precise and careful fashion. Members include everything from individuals who authenticate%0a%3c or restore valuable antiques to archaeologists and even chefs. Members of this Legacy%0a%3c come from all social classes and professions but are united by the attention they pay to the%0a%3c objects and devices they use as part of their daily lives. They also tend to be highly physical%0a%3c and even sensual individuals who enjoy physically experiencing the world around them.%0a%3c Members who do not work with their hands extensively in their chosen professions almost%0a%3c always enjoy hobbies where they do so.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Appearance: Animists pay close attention to all the goods they regularly use. Regardless of%0a%3c whether they prefer rugged outdoor clothing or expensive and fancy suits, all their clothes%0a%3c are well-made and maintained. Few Animists would consider purchasing shoddy or ill-made%0a%3c goods or goods that will wear out quickly. They prefer to have time to develop a close%0a%3c relationship with their possessions. Animists are also unusually careful in the way they use%0a%3c objects and avoid slamming doors or otherwise harshly using objects unless it is necessary.%0a%3c In stories about Animists Told by other mages, the followers of this Legacy regularly talk to%0a%3c the objects and devices they use, and some mages watch Animists closely to see whether%0a%3c they are actually whispering or listening to their wristwatches or pocketknives. In reality, only%0a%3c a few of the most eccentric Animists talk to objects when not in private or using the%0a%3c Attainments of their Legacy. Instead, to avoid being seen as deeply eccentric and potentially%0a%3c even unbalanced, the vast majority of Animists are far more discrete. However, most touch%0a%3c and sometimes even caress the objects they use; often rewarding a well-functioning object%0a%3c in much the same manner a dog owner would pet a dog that performed a trick particularly%0a%3c well.\\%0a%3c Many Animists are exceedingly knowledgeable about the various sorts of objects and%0a%3c devices they regularly use and can go on at great length about the relative merits of different%0a%3c cell phones, cars, computers or different brands of tools. However, most are also at least%0a%3c moderately socially adept and understand at least the basics of how not to bore or annoy%0a%3c those to whom they are talking.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Doctrine%0a%3c %0a%3c :Prerequisites: Matter 2, Persuasion 2, Crafts 1%0a%3c %0a%3c :Initiation: The applicant must present at a Conclave (see below) an object of excellent%0a%3c quality that they have crafted themselves by ‘hand’ - meaning that mundane tools are%0a%3c allowed but using magic to shape them is not. The creation is judged by a panel of Lords,%0a%3c who also take the opinion of the object’s spirit into consideration.%0a%3c :Organization: Some Animists get along better with the spirits of their favorite objects than%0a%3c with other humans, including other mages, and many have little time for formal ceremonies%0a%3c or bureaucracy. As a result, Animists have a fairly loose organization, where members keep%0a%3c in touch on a moderately informal basis. In the past decade, this trend has been further%0a%3c exacerbated by the fact that an increasing number of Animists are rousing the spirits of their%0a%3c cell phones and answering machines and having them screen calls and deal with most%0a%3c callers like an especially skilled 24-hour secretary.\\%0a%3c In most cases, Animists are connected to one another by ties of personal friendship, with%0a%3c those who are well liked or respected by their fellows having far more contact with other%0a%3c members of this Legacy. The only exception to this loose and informal contact is during the%0a%3c Legacy’s yearly Conclave. Held in a different city each year, this Conclave is a chance for%0a%3c members to meet, for individuals who wish to become members to attempt to convince an%0a%3c Animist to teach them, and for the various Animists to show off the various spirits with which%0a%3c they are working.\\%0a%3c With an atmosphere somewhere between an academic conference, a high-end craft fair and%0a%3c a dog show, Conclaves are chaotic events wherein members report about interesting or%0a%3c unusual applications of their abilities. The most chaotic and prestigious part of the Conclave%0a%3c consists of the more experienced members showing off objects whose spirits they have%0a%3c awakened. In addition, Animists also discuss and demonstrate ways they have found to be%0a%3c able to work in tandem with their spirits. As noted, the Conclave is also where prospective%0a%3c members can attempt to convince an Animist to teach them. This in-person contact is%0a%3c crucial, because many Animists decide whether those prospective members are worthy to%0a%3c join this Legacy by watching them interact with the objects around them.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Magic%0a%3c %0a%3c :Ruling Arcana: Arcana Type%0a%3c :Yantras: Carrying out maintenance on an object (+1), building an object from scratch using%0a%3c your hands (+2 when using machines that are powered by the users own muscles, +1 with%0a%3c power tools), laying out plans or scale models, e.g. technical drawing, knitting pattern (+2).%0a%3c :Oblations: Polishing or caring for tools and equipment, knitting, carving or performing other%0a%3c handcrafts, selecting materials for use in some craft project.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Attainments%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!First Attainment: Commanding the Inanimate%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Initiation%0a%3c The Mage can control mechanical%0a%3c and electrical objects in a fashion%0a%3c similar to Remote Control (MtA,%0a%3c p155) simply by conversing with it.%0a%3c Objects perform the requests%0a%3c made of them with a maximum dice%0a%3c pool of the Mage’s Matter dots.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Optional: Spirit 1%0a%3c The Mage may address the spirit of an object%0a%3c directly, as per the spell Exorcist’s Eye (MtA, p180).%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Second Attainment: Exalting the Form%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Matter 2, Crafts 2%0a%3c Objects are inclined to work more efficiently when in the%0a%3c hand of a Lord of the Inanimate. A tool gains the 9-%0a%3c Again quality as per Find the Balance (MtA, p155).%0a%3c %0a%3c :Optional: Spirit 2%0a%3c The Mage may transfer Essence to or from the spirit%0a%3c of an object in a fashion similar to Channel Essence%0a%3c (MtA, p180). If channelling to a spirit, the Mage is%0a%3c restricted only by their Gnosis-derived Mana per%0a%3c turn rate. The Mage cannot take Essence from a%0a%3c spirit against their will using this Attainment - they must either have persuaded it or placated it through some other obligation.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Third Attainment: Shepherd of the Craft%0a%3c :Prerequisites: Matter 3, Persuasion 3%0a%3c With a touch, the Mage restores a number of Structure%0a%3c points to a damaged object equal to their dots in Matter.%0a%3c At the STs discretion this may also provide a bonus to%0a%3c further negotiations with the object’s spirit.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Optional: Spirit 3%0a%3c The Mage may also heal the spirit of that object, restoring two boxes of bashing damage for%0a%3c each dot of Spirit the Mage possesses.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Fourth Attainment: Name%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Matter 4, Crafts 3%0a%3c The Mage can grant an object a semblance of life and allow it autonomous movement. The%0a%3c Attainment does not grant physical features that the object does not already possess - a%0a%3c humanoid statue could serve drinks or fight enemies, but an animated car can only steer%0a%3c itself and open its own doors.\\%0a%3c This Attainment effectively grants the Mage dots in Retainer equal to their dots in Matter as%0a%3c per Golem (MtA 158). The Mage may elect to renew the duration of at any time before the%0a%3c current duration expires, but must be present with the servant to do so.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Optional: Spirit 4%0a%3c The Mage has the power to grant sentience and self-awareness to an object’s spirit. In%0a%3c addition to the animation granted above, the Mage may enter into a conversation with the%0a%3c spirit (at least for the length of their Ritual Interval) and use Rouse Spirit (MtA, p182) with%0a%3c Advanced Duration on the object. For a cost of 1 Mana the effect can be made Indefinite.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Fifth Attainment: Name%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Matter 5, Persuasion 4%0a%3c As a person now befitting the title of Lord, the Mage can now reshape matter to their will. By%0a%3c touching an object and speaking gently to it, they may vastly reconfigure an object to any%0a%3c design.\\%0a%3c The Mage can reshape Matter in any form as per the Shaping spell (MtA, p156), with Reach%0a%3c reducing the required successes for creating intricate shapes by their dots in Matter and%0a%3c granting the ability to shape solid matter. This includes intricate mechanisms and moving%0a%3c parts - the Mage may change a hunk of steel into a complex gear-driven mechanism, for%0a%3c example. For a cost of 1 Mana, the Mage may affect an object up to Size 15.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Optional: Spirit 5%0a%3c With their grandest Attainment, a Lord of the Inanimate may reshape an ephemeral being as%0a%3c easily as solid matter. As per the Shape Spirit spell (MtA, p184), they may invoke a number%0a%3c of effects equal to their dots in Spirit with the option of healing Aggravated damage with%0a%3c Mana on a one-for-one basis. The effects use the Advanced Duration Factors and the Mage%0a%3c must converse with the spirit for a minimum of their Ritual Interval.%0a

The%0a%3c Quiet philosophy asks its adherents to working of magic within the limits of the Fallen World,%0a%3c within what the Quiescence already draws the line for. Already prone to drawing suspicion from%0a%3c other Awakened, especially that they were Seer fronts, the Legacy lost what tenuous contact it%0a%3c maintained with the larger Awakened society when one of their founders turned Banisher and%0a%3c started hunting them down.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Quiet philosophy was largely a product of the 1940s and the 1950s, and when the zeitgeist%0a%3c gave way so did the Legacy's main appeal. However, the Liars were always good with keeping%0a%3c their heads down from the authorities, especially with a murderous Banisher on their trails, and%0a%3c a few Quiet cabals have survived to the modern era. With the advent of communications and%0a%3c social media technology, there have even been mages who reinvented the Quiet philosophy in%0a%3c the modern age to better hide from prying Sleeper eyes, some of which have successfully%0a%3c inherited the Quiescents' old mantle.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Origins%0a%3c %0a%3c :Parentage: Moros, Guardians of the Veil or Nameless%0a%3c :Background&#8203;: The original Liars drew from war veterans, or those who were affected by the%0a%3c World War in one way. They were often comfortable with illegal, if not criminal activities, for the%0a%3c Legacy's founders felt morality less important to their own behavioral code over magic, and%0a%3c morality is best taken in moderation after seeing what horrors a moral man can do. While%0a%3c modern Liars aren't so familiar with war, they are still adept at evading the law and working in%0a%3c grey zones, especially when it comes to avoiding scrutiny.%0a%3c :Appearances&#8203;: Quiescent mages live on the fringe of society, where they can fade into the%0a%3c background easily. This is easier in the modern era, where big cities that allow such are plenty.%0a%3c Liars dress simply as expected, and get on by with whatever work they find. Many do find work%0a%3c as investigators, or any other occupation where their skills would be needed.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Doctrine%0a%3c %0a%3c :Prerequisites: Time 2, Science 2, two dots in one of the following Skills; Investigation, Stealth,%0a%3c Brawl, Intimidation, Streetwise%0a%3c %0a%3c :Initiation&#8203;: The Legacy draws exclusively from practitioners of Quiet Magic, and even then it's%0a%3c usually the practitioner seeking them out than the Legacy approaching her. In the applicant's%0a%3c pursuit the elder Liars judge her ability and character, seeing if she can find them with minimal%0a%3c reliance on magic and on others' help.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Organization&#8203;: The Quiescent are one of the most diffused Legacies, the Legacy offering no%0a%3c greater organization to fall back on to and leaving each Liar on their own. The mentor severs%0a%3c regular contact when his pupil learns the Attainment she was calling to him to help on, and the%0a%3c pupil likewise moves on until she deems herself progressed enough for the next Attainment.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Theory&#8203;: The Quiescent do not think of the Quiescence as a Lie to be challenged, but just%0a%3c another principle of Supernal magic that can be worked through and around. They believe that it%0a%3c exists to protect Sleepers from the Awakened so that they may progress without intervention.%0a%3c Furthermore, they believe Quiescence also protect the Awakened from Sleepers so that they%0a%3c may work lesser but more stable wonders, free from Dissonance.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Magic%0a%3c %0a%3c :Ruling Arcana: Time%0a%3c :Yantras: Streets and alleys filled with non-descript buildings (+1); quietly observing the subject%0a%3c (+1); investigatory tools such as magnifiers (+1); confronting but not appearing in front of the%0a%3c subject (+1, +2 if managing the confrontation without verbal interaction)%0a%3c :Oblations&#8203;: Menial chores such as cleaning; solving a puzzle; mixing drinks; shadowing a%0a%3c Sleeper or a group of them%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Attainments%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!First Attainment: No Mistake%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Initiation%0a%3c The Liar wishes not to disturb the Quiet, so she learns to tread carefully. This Attainment divines%0a%3c whether the subject's next Supernal spell will provoke Quiescence with a "Yes" or "No" answer,%0a%3c essentially being a limited version of the "Divination" spell with Reach assigned to instant use.%0a%3c :Optional Arcana: Death 1%0a%3c Provocation of Quiescence and the taint of Paradox tend to go hand in hand, and the Silencer%0a%3c learns to pick up signs telling whether his subject is willing to be Quiet. This effect resembles the%0a%3c "Soul Marks" spell, but is limited to finding out if the subject is Awakened and if she is suffering a%0a%3c Paradox Condition. Reach is assigned to instant use.\\%0a%3c While Withstood by Resolve, the mage can bypass it if he uses this effect immediately after his%0a%3c subject casts a Supernal spell.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Second Attainment: No Past%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Time 2, Science 3%0a%3c The Liar learns to mask themselves from temporal scrutiny into their pasts. This Attainment%0a%3c resembles the "Shield of Chronos" spell, with Reach assigned to Advanced Duration. While%0a%3c providing no protection over the future, the Attainment's protection over the past extends to%0a%3c mundane investigations as well. Mundane scrutiny automatically fails, and the Liar scores%0a%3c automatic successes equal to her Time dots on Clash of Wills provoked by magical scrutiny.\\%0a%3c To use this Attainment, the Liar must spend a scene ritually destroying personal belongings that%0a%3c betray her past life, most often pictures and identification, and other items she has used%0a%3c extensively.%0a%3c :Optional&#8203;: Death 2%0a%3c The Silencer can now move subtly enough in the present that he doesn't leave a past trail that%0a%3c could follow him. He replicates the "Without a Trace" spell, with Reach assigned to Advanced%0a%3c Duration. The required preparation for this effect is identical to that of the Attainment's main%0a%3c effect, and can be taken in conjunction to enable both effects.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Third Attainment: No Present%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Time 3, two dots in a second Skill among the optional prerequisite Skills%0a%3c Hiding one's past is only the first step towards hiding yourself from unwanted attention, and the%0a%3c Liar must learn to protect her present self from unexpected encounters as well. This Attainment%0a%3c duplicates the "Momentary Flux" spell, with Reach assigned to instant use, Advanced Duration,%0a%3c and gaining an Initiative bonus when acting on the gleaned information.%0a%3c :Optional&#8203;: Death 3%0a%3c The Quiescent is familiar with violence more than they appear to be, and a Silencer quickly%0a%3c learns how to break things when needed to save his own skin. He emulates the "Decay" spell,%0a%3c with Reach assigned to instant use and directly decreasing the object's Structure.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Fourth Attainment: No Future%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Time 4, Science 4%0a%3c The Legacy was born in the uncertainty of the 1940s, with any prediction of humanity's future%0a%3c only a phantom. The modern era sympathizes still with that uncertainty of the future, and the%0a%3c Liar who internalizes it can choose to shift the future to her immediate benefit. This Attainment%0a%3c replicates the "Choose the Thread" spell, with Reach assigned to instant use and affecting%0a%3c supernatural powers including spellcasting.%0a%3c :Optional&#8203;: Death 4%0a%3c A Silencer's pursuit of a Quiet life rarely leaves him with only inanimate objects in his way. He%0a%3c duplicates the "Enervation" spell, with Reach assigned to instant use.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Fifth Attainment: No History%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Time 5, two dots in a third Skill among the optional prerequisite Skills%0a%3c No one is perfect, and even the most dedicated of the Quiescent find themselves violating their%0a%3c philosophy and the Fallen World. The Liar who reaches the pinnacle of her silent reservation in%0a%3c the status quo of the world gain the ability to amend mistakes of her own or others, changing%0a%3c history itself if needed. This Attainment resembles the "Corridors of Time" spell, with Reach%0a%3c assigned to allowing the Temporal Sympathy Attainment.\\%0a%3c With or without Temporal Sympathy, the Liar can only choose moments when the subject%0a%3c provoked Quiescence as the point of divergence, so that the subject never takes the course of%0a%3c action that provoked Quiescence.\\%0a%3c To use this Attainment, the Liar must spend a scene ritually creating a portfolio of the subject's%0a%3c life by using objects and symbols dear to them, and ritually destroying them in their presence.%0a%3c :Optional&#8203;: Death 5%0a%3c The Silencer outright destroys his own presence in the world, ensuring that he will not marr the%0a%3c Fallen World's natural progress. This effect resembles the "Empty Presence" spell, with Reach%0a%3c assigned to Advanced Duration. Instead of violence, however, it is the provocation of%0a%3c Quiescence that breaks the effect. The Silencer scores automatic successes equal to his Death%0a%3c dots in Clash of Wills provoked by Mage Sight or other abilities.\\%0a%3c To use this Attainment, the Silencer must spend a point of Mana, and follow the same%0a%3c preparation the Attainment's main effect requires.%0a

They tend to be more apt to ritually cast, using sigils and circles that can take some time to prepare. Ritual Circle (+2): Whether salt, sulfer or chalk, a circle denotes the eternal continuation of cycles, the old becoming the new, and vice versa. Any power using a ritual circle ends if the circle is broken, or the caster steps outside of it.%0a%3c :Oblations: Prayer to spirits or other beings, ceremonies meant to celebrate old traditions. Generally speaking done with either a roll of Wits+Occult, or Presence+Occult, depending on the styling of the ritual. Telling inspiring stories of the old ways: Presence+Expression/occult%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Attainments%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!First Attainment: Understanding the Katsina%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Initiation\\%0a%3c The Caretaker’s frst and most important revelation is the nature of her spirit guide; an incarnation of the Primal Wild whose nature most powerfully resonates with the mage’s own. This “spirit” (which is an archetypal ideal, rather than an individual entity) is an animal, elemental manifestation, plant, or something of the sort: coyotes, bears, ravens, mountains, streams, storms, cacti, or cedar trees, for example. When seen in Shadow, the mage possesses features reminiscent of the spirit guide. The player and Storyteller should work together to determine an appropriate spirit guide for the Caretaker.\\%0a%3c When activating this attainment, the Mage becomes able to see, hear, and speak with spirits for a couple turns at a time (per transitory duration), though this may be continually re-activated during a conversation to allow for 'uninterrupted' perception.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Second Attainment: Veil of the Katsina%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Spirit 2\\%0a%3c As connections grow between the Caretaker and their Guide, they begin to realize how to protect themselves from spiritual predation. They internalize the Ephemeral Shield spell, allowing them to activate it with a short ritual to gain its protection for the day.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Third Attainment: Calling the Katsina%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Spirit 3\\%0a%3c The Caretaker grows closer to oneness with her spirit guide, embracing its metaphysical qualities. The mage’s Primal connection grants her an Influence (as per spirit In&#64258;uences, on pp. 258-259 of Mage: The Awakening and Werewolf: The Forsaken page 187) with a descriptor identical to the nature of her guide, at a rating equal to half her Gnosis, rounding down. (In other words, a Gnosis 4 willworker who identifes with the wolf gains an In&#64258;uence of Wolves at two dots, while one with a Gnosis 8 whose spirit guide embodies rain gains an In&#64258;uence of Rain at four dots.) The mage rolls Gnosis + Spirit to use this In&#64258;uence and spends points of Mana in place of Essence, on a one-for-one basis. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Fourth Attainment: Becoming the Katsina%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Spirit 4\\%0a%3c With this Attainment, the Caretaker acquires the ability to temporarily physically incarnate certain of the qualities of his spirit guide, calling its ideal down from the Primal Wild and into himself, and becoming something halfway between spirit and &#64258;esh. By activating this attainment, the character becomes able to cross the Gauntlet as if with the spell Reaching with the Reach spent, forming an Iris that lasts for about a turn. They may also activate it without the Reach to become able to interact physically with the other side of the Gauntlet for up to a month at a time.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Optional Arcana: Life 4\\%0a%3c As an instant action, the Mage may take on effects appropriate to their spirit guide, akin to the Transform Life spell, with a number of features gained equal to the Mage's Life Arcanum. This lasts for up to a day at a time. As well, the Mage may gain access to these features automatically (for the same duration) upon activating the base attainment to interact with the other side of the Gauntlet (as that closeness draws their spirit guide in more easily).%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Fifth Attainment: Purity of Destruction%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Spirit 5\\%0a%3c At this level of understanding, the Caretaker understands that even those who try to meld the old with the new, must sometimes cut out a cancer before it has time to spread. Those that advance to this highest of levels are able to Annihilate Spirits at will, though they tend to use this power sparingly... This power is used more often after every other option has been exhausted, and tends to even then, only be used sparingly, as spirits tend to shy away from those with the power to end their very existence completely. This will affect any spirit up to Rank 5, and the Mage gains a number of successes on the ensuing Clash of Wills equal to their Spirit rating.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!%25center%25''Perfected Adepts''%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Origins%0a%3c %0a%3c :Parentage: Obrimos or Adamantine Arrow%0a%3c %0a%3c (Background and History are as presented in Mage 1e, page 349)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Doctrine%0a%3c %0a%3c :Prerequisites: Life 2, Athletics 2, 2 dots in Brawl or Weaponry%0a%3c %0a%3c (Initiation as per Mage 1e)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Magic%0a%3c %0a%3c :Ruling Arcana: Life%0a%3c :Yantras: Rigorous Workout to focus the mind (+2), Meditate into a State of Peace (+2), Disregard Worldly Concerns in Pursuit of the Spell (+1, +2 if it imposes a Negative Condition)%0a%3c :Oblations: Rigorous Martial Arts Practice, Extended Meditations, Exhibiting Humility%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Attainments%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!First Attainment: Chi Sight%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Initiation\\%0a%3c With but a glance (and an instant action), the Monk can focus on the energies in a living thing call Chi or Prana, and discern information about the body it is contained within. This includes all information as per the spell Analyze Life including health, sex, species, age, conditions, tilts, and physical attribute dots. To focus on another individual, the mage must use this Attainment again. (As Per Life 1 Analyze Life)%0a%3c %0a%3c :Optional Arcanum: Forces 1\\%0a%3c Learning to use his Chi to subtly enhance his own actions, the Monk is able to run a little faster, jump a little further, or lift a little more. The total distance (in yards) covered on a jump, the subject’s swimming and running Speed, and any climbing or lifting rolls gain a bonus of +1. Actions are also less strenuous when moving so efficiently.The Monk gains a +1 bonus on rolls to resist fatigue. (as per Forces 1, Kinetic Efficiency)%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Second Attainment: Body Temple%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Life 2\\%0a%3c As long as the Monk practices his daily (ritual) exercise regimen, he maintains full control over his normally autonomous bodily functions, with effects identical to the Life 2 Body Control spell. (Ritual Cast, Advanced Duration)%0a%3c %0a%3c :Optional Arcanum: Forces 2\\%0a%3c More attuned to the subtle changes in temperature, vibration, and all the other minor variations in the forms of energy surrounding her that are often ignored, the Monk becomes able to intuitively feel as well as see forms of electromagnetic radiation, sound, and kinetic energies, allowing her to operate without penalty in complete darkness, and ignore any penalties from the Blindness or Deafness Tilts or Conditions. She can still see and hear and make out details, even in the dark, although colors and tones are somewhat muted. This increased sensitivity does make the Monk more vulnerable to bright lights and loud noises, which may inflict penalties equal to the Blindness condition. (As per Forces 1 Nightvision, Advanced Duration)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Third Attainment: Chi Force%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Life 3\\%0a%3c The Monk’s constant exercise regimen has granted him an unparalleled physique, permitting him to channel his chi into it to enhance the potency of musculature, suppleness of ligaments, or rigidity and durability of his frame. So long as the Monk maintains his daily exercise regimen, he may, each day, increase one attribute by his dots in Life for the remainder of the scene up to his normal maximum. (As per Life 3 Honing the Form, Ritual Cast, Advanced Duration)%0a%3c %0a%3c :Optional Arcana: Forces 3\\%0a%3c The Monk’s Chi can be channeled into more than his mere form, but can be projected out of his form in the manner of kinetic energy. With an instant action, the Monk may channel his chi into his melee attacks, increasing damage and turning it from Bashing into Lethal. Furthermore, any successful attack causes ripples of chi to pass directly through the subject disorientating them and applying the Stunned tilt. (As per Forces 2 Kinetic Strike, Spell Specific Reach)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Fourth Attainment: Inviolate Form%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Life 4\\%0a%3c The Monk may channel his Chi within himself or another to heal damage, as per Life 4 Mend.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Optional Arcana: Forces 4\\%0a%3c Channeling his Chi around himself the Monk is able to use it to redirect objects that would otherwise strike him. As an Instant Action, the Monk can focus his chi about him; thereafter as a reflexive action he can redirect a number of objects each round equal to his dots in Forces. These must all be of size 5 or less and the monk cannot redirect them unless he could apply his Defense. However, this effect does function against even individuals, allowing the Monk to deflect melee attacks. (As per Forces 3 Turn Momentum, Spell Specific Reach)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Fifth Attainment: Perfect Body%0a%3c :Prerequisite: Life 5\\%0a%3c As per the previous attainment, Chi Force, but the Monk may choose two physical attributes to enhance, and he may increase either or both above his normal maximum. (As per Life 3 Honing the Form, Ritual Cast, Advanced Duration, Spell Specific Reaches +2)    %0a%3c %0a%3c :Optional Arcana: Forces 5\\%0a%3c With an instant action, and a point of Mana, the Monk is able to release his Chi as bolts of pure energy in an aimed attack, doing aggravated damage equal to his Forces dots. (As per Forces 4 Thunderbolt, Spell Specific Reach)%0a%3c %0a

Not every city, of course, has more than a handful of either, and even those populated by both will sometimes have their populations kept apart by fear, xenophobia, or perhaps just silent agreements. But in nearly every nation both can be found, you’ll find a few together. An Iron Master who’s taken to studying the local Kindred, both seeking out parallels with humanity and how they themselves interact with the human herd. The Mekhet who’s learned of the spirits by silently and respectfully watching from the side as an old friend’s pack performs their rites. A Bone Shadow seeking a strange form of insight by sacrificing his prey over an Acolyte’s altar. %0a%3c %0a%3c And of course, the Dead Wolf running with the Pack.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Background%0a%3c *“''This Story is True''. They say that before the blood reacts beneath the auspice moon, it’s as malleable as any human’s. You can be killed and risen as some zombie, permanently merged with a spirit, or even Embraced by one of our kind. Our founder, if you can call him by such a formal-sounding title, was chosen by Luna, but before his change, his blood was claimed by a Savage who’d taken on a bane forcing her into frenzy any time the full moon shone down upon her. He was just the one that was unlucky enough to be in her path when it did, but somehow, her Beast chose not to kill, but to reproduce, and she did it right in Luna’s face.”%0a%3c *“''This Story is True''. You know of the firstborn, Urdur, those known to take on the mantle of our tribes, those children of Father Wolf that came before any others. They became the patrons of our Tribes and that of our… less wise cousins, and are spoken of in countless tales. But Father Wolf’s spirit children were not the only his essence found its way into. Some few say that he sired another, a wolf formed not of ephemera, but the essence of darkness itself, recognizable by yellow eyes among a body that’s otherwise nothing more than Shadow. It refuses patronage to those few of the People that have sought it out, but some say it’s granted a blessing to others…”%0a%3c *“Yeah, what do they call ‘em, the fuckin’ Dead Wolves? I heard a story about ‘em. One o’ ours, some Mexican guy, I don’ know his name, they say he found his way into some spirit realm, or whatever shit the acolytes are always talkin’ about. Came across his Beast, but like, some creepy haunted version of it, and it, uh, whaddya call it, possessed him, like the damned owls do? And merged with him. But he didn’ lose control. For some reason, grabbed the attention of those lupine guys, and it all broke down from there. No, I don’t fuckin’ know if the story’s true!”  %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!The Becoming%0a%3c %0a%3c The Dead Wolves are most prevalent in northern Mexico, where the Uratha and Kindred have formed more substantive ties, and thus are less wary about getting close to each other, but despite what many think, the Dead Wolves don’t NEED to have ties with the Uratha. Still, allies or contacts among the Forsaken (or other Werewolves) are common, and those that already have a connection to them are most likely to be noticed and chosen by those of the bloodline, whether to become a Childe in the first place or simply to be brought closer beneath an Avus’ tutelage.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Requirements:%0a%3c %0a%3c The Dead Wolves are Gangrel, the Savages being the only Kindred that truly understand the form the Beast takes, and thus have the unique ability to shape it to match that which dwells within the soul of the Uratha.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Clan: Gangrel%0a%3c %0a%3c :Interactions With the Danse:%0a%3c %0a%3c Unsurprisingly, in areas where tensions between Kindred and Uratha are high or at least far short of allegiance, but where there’s still communication, a position often forms as a sort of ambassador (when most respected) or message-carrier (when not so well thought of) between the Kindred and the local Werewolves. Dead Wolves, of course, are uniquely suited to such roles, and often serve them even if not made to do so in a formal manner. %0a%3c Beyond that, the Circle likely harbors the highest number of them, followed, oddly enough, by the Sanctified. The Ordo Dracul and Carthians are probably next most likely, for the sake of studying their mixed condition in the former case or simply due to the ‘looser’ structure of the latter fitting them better. The Invictus very rarely take on those of this bloodline, but it’s not entirely unheard of. %0a%3c %0a%3c :Nickname: Wolf-Blooded (confusing as that may be among Uratha society)%0a%3c %0a%3c :Bloodline Bane:%0a%3c %0a%3c The Dead Wolves take on a mirrored aspect of Luna’s influence, and so find themselves vulnerable to the substance that resonates most harshly with her children: silver. At Humanity 6, all Dead Wolves take on Repulsion (Silver) as a bane, though may choose a form of Detachment to stave off as normal, but it inherently counts against the limits of three banes either way.%0a%3c %0a%3c In addition, those that have aligned with a Pack of Uratha find that their Beast resonates with their distant cousins’. They gain a “Trigger” for their Beast’s frenzy, similarly to a Uratha’s Kuruth trigger, but automatically aligned to The Pack. Whenever they see a member of their Pack harmed (with at least lethal damage), they must roll to resist frenzy. If the roll fails, their Beast will ALWAYS take on their Predatory Aspect, if they know that discipline, but this only applies to frenzy triggered through the Pack. %0a%3c %0a%3c :Bloodline Disciplines: Animalism, Vigor, Protean, Resilience%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!Bloodline Gift: Sublunario%0a%3c %0a%3c Sublunario, the gift of the Dead Wolves, is a manifestation of both Luna’s influence on her Undead children, and the aspects of the Wolf they’ve taken on through their blood. This provides them with a small array of benefits that becomes more potent when the Dead Wolf is part of a Pack.%0a%3c *All Dead Wolves have a Tell, chosen from those that the Wolf-Blooded have access to, whether they shared the blood of the Uratha in life or not. In addition, they may buy Wolf-Blooded merits if they don’t rely on any trait the Kindred doesn’t have (such as Integrity). %0a%3c *Given their spiritual ties, Dead Wolves may purchase the Totem merit if part of a pack (whether a Pack in Werewolf terms, Gangrel terms, or both). The Totem provides the normal benefits, but cannot grant traits Vampires are normally incapable of gaining (such as certain merits) to Kindred. %0a%3c *Dead Wolves treat their Blood Potency multiplied by two as effective Renown for calculating effective Spirit Rank, and may spend a point of Vitae to “flare” their spiritual might similar to a Uratha’s brand, treating their natural Blood Potency divided by 2 (round up) as the effective rating, for the purposes of any respect accorded. This grants Dead Wolves the “Proven“ condition. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!!Proven%0a%3c Your character is a Proven member of the People, despite having a Kindred’s Beast instead of an inner Wolf. She’s integrated, shown her strength, and can hold her own against the more natural born hunters she stands among. Those Uratha that know of this often feel the need to see for themselves just how well she can withstand their world. Any rolls to test the character’s strength, loyalty, or right to be among the Uratha gains a +2 bonus, but doing so often simply reinforces her right to be there. %0a%3c :Possible Sources: A Dead Wolf flaring their Blood Potency by spending Vitae.%0a%3c :Resolution: After at least one Uratha character, or a character that’s knowingly a part of one’s pack, has taken advantage of the +2 bonus, you may shed this condition. In doing so, you may add your character’s Blood Potency divided by 2 (round up) as automatic successes to a social roll among the Uratha, or to a roll utilizing one of the skills associated with the auspice of the current moon phase. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25werewolf%25'''Lodges'''%25%25%0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25mage%25'''Legacies'''%25%25%0a%3c %0a%3c %25right%25[[#top|&#8593; back to top]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!%25center%25%25werewolf%25'''Lodges'''%25%25%0a
