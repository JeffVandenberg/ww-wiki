The hair is often worn in dreadlocks, pigtails or other interesting styles, depending on her mood. Her body is fit and lithe, and she carries herself with natural, easy grace. She dresses in a manner that would be out-of-place anywhere besides a nightclub or Burning Man. Old jeans, crop tops, baja hoodies and short skirts. When her clothing shows off her midriff, a black ink tattoo of a fox can be seen on the small of her back, along the spine. Trixie is usually barefoot, though she dons sandals if footwear is required. %0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Mein''%0a%0a%25center%25The green eyes turn golden, and her canine teeth become more pronounced. Trixie has a big pair of tufted fox ears framing her head, red with black rims and white interiors. Three long, luxuriously furred fox tails wave lazily behind her, also red, but with white fur on the ends. Her feet at paw-like, covered in black fur, which runs up her legs, turning red at the top of her calves before giving way to skin high on her thighs. Her arms are similar, furry black hands turning red on her lower arms before ending just past her elbows. While her fingers and toes are clawed, they don’t seem to be sharp enough to do any real harm. %0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Mantle''%0a%0a%25center%25The faint, fresh scent of a lush forest just after a spring rainfall follows in Trixie's wake. %0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''Friends, Lovers and Allies (not in that order)'''%0a%0a||! %25changeling%25Image ||! %25changeling%25Name ||! %25changeling%25Relationship ||! %25changeling%25Comment ||! %25changeling%25Ringtone ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/HSSPoxF.png || %25changeling%25[[Ryuko Saito]] || %25changeling%25Ryu, Hot Wings || %25changeling%25Trix's first friend in town, Ryuko gave her a home and a family. || %25newwin%25[[https://youtu.be/q9dvwVMsGn8|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25http://i.imgur.com/UmuocUY.jpg || %25changeling%25[[Blair Bell]] || %25changeling%25Kitten, Pussy...cat || %25changeling%25Former roomie and motleymate, but they're still close friends and troublemakers || %25newwin%25[[https://youtu.be/vEtbfzMLVWU|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://pre13.deviantart.net/ed5c/th/pre/f/2017/222/0/c/parah_by_sakimichan-dbjlue2.jpg || %25changeling%25[[Vrys Sarkhet]] || %25changeling%25Spooder, Lolth || %25changeling%25A fellow Spring Beast, they've gone hunting together! || %25newwin%25[[https://youtu.be/psAvTNNbcM8|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DkU9fAxUUAAlyFG.jpg || %25mage%25[[Autumn Aion Averlane]] || %25mage%25Mrs. Ryu, Annie Lennox || %25mage%25Ryuko's girlfriend.

She has worked music festivals, nightclubs, weddings, bar and bat mitzvahs and more over the past couple years. Recently returned from the road, Vixen is looking for work locally! Perhaps you have a party coming up in need of great music?%0a%0a!!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''Hedge Scout (Changeling)'': %0aA Beast with a sharp nose, solid survival skills and experience with the Hedge, Trixie can be a real asset for traveling the local faescape. She may be willing to help others out for the right price... or if she's bored. Or hungry. Whatever, just so long as she doesn't miss her naptime.%0a%0a!!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''Wandering Fool (Everyone)'': %0aCurious and easily bored, Trixie is often found simply exploring the city and people watching. Sometimes, she's a little too curious for her own good. At least foxes are luckier than cats in that regard.%0a%0a!!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''The Kitsune (Supernatural)'':%0aThe nine-tailed fox spirits of Japanese legend were powerful sorceresses and expert shapeshifters. Trixie is... not quite there yet, but she's growing in skill fast. Her arsenal of contracts and goblin vows expands regularly, and she changes form very easily. She may only have three tails so far, but more will surely sprout in time.%0a%0a!!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''The Joyeux (Changeling)'':%0aTrixie's role in the Spring Court is as a Joyeux (pronounced "zse-y-you"), and it is her duty to inspire happiness and contentment in other Lost. Desires are more easily pursued when one is at ease. Random acts of kindness, or just being her usual self (which is to say, a shameless goof) are often enough to make others smile and forget their worries for a time.%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25changeling%25 '''A Foxy Gallery'''%0a%0a|| %25thumb%25[[https://imgur.com/VdAZKnl|https://i.imgur.com/VdAZKnl.jpg"DJ Vixen!"]] || %25thumb%25[[https://imgur.com/cVDTaLH|https://i.imgur.com/cVDTaLH.jpg"Fox Form!"]] || %25thumb%25[[https://imgur.com/7Fa3kEl|https://i.imgur.com/7Fa3kEl.jpg"Kitsune Mask!"]] || %25thumb%25[[https://imgur.com/PpMa99f|https://i.imgur.com/PpMa99f.jpg"She's Just This Huggable"]] || %25thumb%25[[https://imgur.com/oNTFgI6|https://i.imgur.com/oNTFgI6.jpg"Urban Fox!"]]||%0a|| %25thumb%25[[https://imgur.com/0DEMalb|https://i.imgur.com/0DEMalb.jpg"Ohai!"]] || %25thumb%25[[https://imgur.com/rb7DXvP|https://i.imgur.com/rb7DXvP.jpg"Out on the town!"]] || %25thumb%25[[https://imgur.com/lbLZ2W4|https://i.imgur.com/lbLZ2W4.png"Kitsune by Aquaytic"]] || %25thumb%25[[https://imgur.com/PZRsgiy|https://i.imgur.com/PZRsgiy.jpg"Cool Fox!"]] || %25thumb%25[[https://imgur.com/iZcX5PW|https://i.imgur.com/iZcX5PW.jpg"Coffee Fox!"]] ||%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25changeling%25 '''Kitsune Powers'''%0a%0a*  %25changeling%25'''Air and Darkness''': %25color=#white%25Illusions on demand!

The hair is often worn in dreadlocks, pigtails or other interesting styles, depending on her mood. Her body is fit and lithe, and she carries herself with natural, easy grace. She dresses in a manner that would be out-of-place anywhere besides a nightclub or Burning Man. Old jeans, crop tops, baja hoodies and short skirts. When her clothing shows off her midriff, a black ink tattoo of a fox can be seen on the small of her back, along the spine. Trixie is usually barefoot, though she dons sandals if footwear is required. %0a%3c %0a---%0a> %25center%25[Enter Here] %0a> %0a51c51%0a%3c %25center%25The green eyes turn golden, and her canine teeth become more pronounced. Trixie has a big pair of tufted fox ears framing her head, red with black rims and white interiors. Three long, luxuriously furred fox tails wave lazily behind her, also red, but with white fur on the ends. Her feet at paw-like, covered in black fur, which runs up her legs, turning red at the top of her calves before giving way to skin high on her thighs. Her arms are similar, furry black hands turning red on her lower arms before ending just past her elbows. While her fingers and toes are clawed, they don’t seem to be sharp enough to do any real harm. %0a---%0a> %25center%25[Enter Here] %0a
