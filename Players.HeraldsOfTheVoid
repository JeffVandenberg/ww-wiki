So few are brought to the central chamber. So few get to touch the Black Stone. So few are truly worthy of The Void’s wisdom. At least, receiving it so directly. But they’ve been watching you. They told me you’re ready. Ready to see just what you’ve been working towards. The transcendence you’re so close to achieving."''%0a%0a%25center%25''"Just this way. Through the hall, and into the door on the left. It’s locked, but it will open for you. Nobody else should be in there. It will be on the altar. You’ll know it. A simple touch, and you’ll hear it. Trust me when I say it will change you forever."''%0a%0a%25center%25''"Me? No, I’m not coming with you. It’s something you have to do alone. But don’t fret. You wouldn’t be doing this if They didn’t already know you were ready for it….”''%0a%0aThe Heralds of the Void are a Cult built around the Renatus Dynasty’s message of spiritual transformation and occult knowledge. With the right information, you can transcend. With the right knowledge, you’ll be capable of anything. With the right support, you can make full use of what Power you have. Of course, few know of their true benefactors behind the scene.%0a%0aUnlike the Renatus Kindred themselves, however, they usually only hear The Void (the group's guiding hand, in a way) in one of two ways: speaking with a member of the Dynasty (who lead the Cult, of course), or being allowed to Commune with it through the Black Stone, a relic of sorts at the center of the Cult that allows a temporary connection with The Void directly. However, other quirks of the supernatural occasionally allow it through other means.%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''%25color=#008080%25Purpose''' \\%0a%0aThe Renatus Dynasty (a Mekhet lineage) leads the Heralds of The Void, who are made up of Kindred, mortals, and other supernatural individuals, towards a sort of preternatural enlightenment focused on sharpening one’s supernatural abilities in order to strengthen the soul and one’s overall potency. They receive indirect guidance from The Void towards this end, the entity said to gain strength from the resonance of the supernatural surrounding the group's members. %0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''%25color=#008080%25Doctrine''' \\%0a%0aThe general goals of the Dynasty and Cult involve a sort of warped version of the Ordo Dracul’s creed, a transcendence past one’s limitations through whatever knowledge can be put to that use. Supernatural power is encouraged, through whatever means, so long as you don’t harm your own growth or that of the rest of the Cult/Dynasty.%0a%0aOverall, the Cult’s members are expected to have access to each other for assistance in developing their abilities, whatever they may be, and will often be temporarily grouped together by those in higher positions for the sake of matching those that need assistance with those most likely to be capable of providing that sort of help. Those of lower initiation are expected to follow groupings decided upon by those higher up (often members of the Dynasty itself).%0a%0aIn addition to these ‘internal’ methods of improvement, members are all expected to use whatever contacts and means they have to learn of Occult relics, artifacts, tomes, and other potential sources of knowledge or supernatural potency, provide that information to the Heralds’ leaders and to each other, and then ultimately to retrieve them in the case of physical items. The exact methods of coming into such things varies between members, but little care is generally given for the legality involved (mundanely speaking; the Heralds preach adherence to the Accords).%0a%0aFinally, all cultists are expected to keep the secrets of other members from the outside world, unless explicit permission is given to provide such information. This isn’t just supernatural secrets, like psychic capabilities or faction affiliation, it includes personal weaknesses, criminal history, and whatever else might come up.%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''%25color=#008080%25Ties to the setting''' \\%0a%0aThe Renatus are said to be inherently distrustful to the point of near-hatred with regards to Invictus Vampires, due to a past rivalry with a failed dynasty aligned with that covenant. They’ve since left, but the Kindred within the Heralds, and sometimes the more knowledgeable members of other factions, still tend to distrust the Invictus.%0a%0a%0a!!!%25center%25'''%25color=#008080%25Titles and Mechanics''' \\%0a%0a:%25center%25Availability: Kindred involved in the cult (ideally most), most ghouls, and all mortals/supernaturals will use the Mystery Cult Initiation merit, with mechanics as shown below:%0a||! Status Level ||! Title ||! Benefits ||%0a|| • || Initiates || '''Initiates''' are clued in to some new, hidden aspect of the world, or are made to further the experience they already have. They '''gain an Occult specialty of their choice'''. They also count as members of the Renatus Dynasty for the purposes of those Kindreds' Dynasty Membership merit. ||%0a|| •• || Adepts || Those '''Adepts''' that have taken their first significant steps towards transcending their limitations learn to apply what they've learned to all aspects of themselves. Generally, these are more trusted, proven members. They '''gain Interdisciplinary Specialty for their Occult specialty (or another Occult specialty they already have).''' ||%0a|| ••• || Seekers || Those '''Seekers''' that have become notable in the cult have become trusted guides and proven scholars, proven members of the Heralds, respected for their abilities and the way they've assisted their kin. All of them gain '''Legendary Language''' to better assist them in uncovering information from any source, and  '''1 dot of Goblin Vow''', representing power granted by The Void and magics borrowed from other members through their shared connection. The purview of the Vow must be something that makes sense for The Void, the Heralds, or the Renatus Dynasty. Some examples might be Evening, Unspilled Blood, Pitch Darkness, Supernatural Power Research, Prophetic Dreams, or Shared Curiosity. This cannot grant Contracts to those that can't normally use them, but can grant an equivalent XP-worth of their own powers. For Changelings, this can take Goblin Vow above 5 dots.  '''Note:''' There are special conditions to get to MCI 3+ IC. See the Cult Contact for details.||%0a|| •••• || Speakers || Those that have proven their knowledge, power, and dedication to the cult, the '''Speakers''', have learned of the Dynasty and the origins of the Heralds, and remain dedicated to the cult's cause. They become entrusted with directing the less informed in the name of the Enlightened, organizing the day to day affairs of the group, and assisting other members in the usage and development of their own powers and abilities, as their own supernatural presence continues to grow. They gain '''3 dots to spend among the following merits''', depending on their personal methodology: '''Support Network (Representing the support of their kin), further Goblin Vow (as above), Mr Lucky (A shadowy Void-like figure), or Destiny.''' ||%0a|| ••••• || The Enlightened || '''The Enlightened''' are those Kindred that have truly embodied the ideals of The Void (Generally, only Kindred reach this level of Initiation, and usually only the Renatus Dynasty). While all Dynasty members have a sense for The Void, only those that truly work towards its ends garner any real attention. '''In addition to whatever information it might provide on its own (ST/Narrator discretion), once per chapter it will provide IC information in response to a question asked by the player that can be answered with a yes/no/maybe (The character doesn't need to be seeking it specifically; the player decides what the void is going to show them), though it may be answered with more than that. This requires no roll or expenditure. ''' ||%0a:NOTE: This is not to say a mortal can’t reach this peak. It just means that they won’t be mortal for long.%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25color=#008080%25'''Deeds'''%0a%0a*Helped destroy a nest of Azlu in the Southwest area.%0a*Assisted in foiling Hart's plot to damage the city through use of an Acamoth and to corrupt the Council.%0a*Helped ward off the Huntsmen of several Changelings.%0a*Assisted in the reconstruction of Parkrose.%0a*Helped deal with and discover information on the "Rogue Carthian" problem.%0a*Assisted in strengthening the new Freehold.%0a%0a%0a!!%25center%25'''%25color=#008080%25Contact''' \\%0a%0a%25center%25 Falco1029%0a%0a%0a(:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a%0a(:cellnr width=100%25:)%0a!%25center%25%25color=#008080%25'''Quotes'''%0a%0a%25mortal%25 ''"I am a quote!
