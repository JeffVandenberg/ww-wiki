Theses are the first things one notices about the young woman her clothing usually baggy makes her look far more frail than she actually is her body honed and strengthened from years of ballet and acrobatics lessons. Graceful as a bird of prey in flight her general expression one of uncertainty and hesitation but when she smiles it can fill a room with the depths of its sincerity and warmth. Her clothing style tends to change depending on where she's going or what she is attending. While it usually consists of Skinny Jeans and Bondage Pants and hoodies, it has been known to flow seemlessly to vintage red carpet dresses and shoes, to even more sultry looking clothes if she's going to club or relax. In the lab however she always wears tight fitting clothes to keep from getting caught in the filaments of her creations.%0a%0a----%0a%0a!!

Since her arrival in Portland Aether has met countless members of the awakened society learning form them discovering their thoughts aspirations and mindsets and is using that firsthand knowledge to help make the City of Portland a more enjoyable place for the other wise. When the time was called upon for her to decide what order she wished to Join She chose the Free Council because she was a creator and innovator at heart and the Assemblies gave her the Freedom to build as she wished to proceed this has allowed her with the help of another Free Council member named NiK to create a device that is capable of creating a powerful barrier using leyline energy.%0a%0aShe is also working on various cybernetic devices whether in the planning stages the prototype stages or the model stages she has shown no signs of stopping her creative streak to date.
