Graceful as a bird of prey in flight her general expression one of uncertainty and hesitation but when she smiles it can fill a room with the depths of its sincerity and warmth. Her clothing style tends to change depending on where she's going or what she is attending. While it usually consists of Skinny Jeans and Bondage Pants and hoodies, it has been known to flow seemlessly to vintage red carpet dresses and shoes, to even more sultry looking clothes if she's going to club or relax. In the lab however she always wears tight fitting clothes to keep from getting caught in the filaments of her creations.%0a%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/WvAtpHD.png%0a%0a!!!!!%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/ex5gkeN.png%0a%0a%25center%25Signals go haywire in her vicinity. either perfect clarity or deadzone just like that metals she touches become magnetised. %0a%0a!!!!!%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/aiYY3dB.png%0a%0a%25center%25It becomes harder to stand against the weight of the world as if the signals in the brain are not firing correctly.%0a%0a!!!!!%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/CofSnUd.png%0a%0a%25center%25 Ferrous Articles become Magnitised Electronics lose signal. %0a%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25https://i.imgur.com/h7eVPfz.png%0a%25lfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=25px margin-right=25px%25https://i.imgur.com/drc3w8e.gif%0a%0aAether isn't one to talk about her entire past with others alot of her accomplishments and skills remain solidly in her personal accomplishments.However it is known that she is an accomplished ballet dancer and attended the Russian Ballet Academy for it. Since her arrival in Portland Aether has met countless members of the awakened society learning form them discovering their thoughts aspirations and mindsets and is using that firsthand knowledge to help make the City of Portland a more enjoyable place for the other wise. When the time was called upon for her to decide what order she wished to Join She chose the Free Council because she was a creator and innovator at heart and the Assemblies gave her the Freedom to build as she wished to proceed this has allowed her with the help of another Free Council member named NiK to create a device that is capable of creating a powerful barrier using leyline energy.%0a%0a%25rfloat text-align=center border='2px solid' margin-top=0px margin-left=25px margin-bottom=5px margin-right=0px width=350px height=450px%25https://i.imgur.com/STVWLie.jpg%0a%0aMost recently after successful voting in the Free Council Aether was elected Syndic of the Assemblies making her  speaker, arbiter, and politico of the Free Council she has graciously accepted the honor and intends to continue to serve in perfect capacity.%0a%0aHer Paling Generator was successfully used to contain the vortice of eldtrich energies released in the destruction of the Soul Engine.Proof positive that her inventions not only work they work frighteningly well.%0a%0aShe has constantly gotten around into various circles not just meeting most of the active mages of the city but she has also successfully met and acquainted herself with several other groups including a couple werewolves and the mortals. %0a%0aShe is also working on various cybernetic devices whether in the planning stages the prototype stages or the model stages she has shown no signs of stopping her creative streak to date.
