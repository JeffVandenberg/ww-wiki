She cut her teeth on protests in her mortal life and has since then continued to try and build a strong case for Vampiric Revolution, a bloody red rebellion against the powers that be. The smallest Cuban Vampire though is still new to this and while she can deliver a damn fiery speech she isn't the best at organization and hasn't actually been able to build up enough support to effect real change, but that doesn't stop her.%0a%3c  %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25vampire%25 ''Street Artist(Artists, Streetwise characters):'' %0a%3c From Anti-Government works of art to rallying pieces for local communities. Savina takes to the streets armed with a selection of spray paint cans and loses herself in the art she puts on public display.
