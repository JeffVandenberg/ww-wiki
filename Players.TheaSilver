She has a few distinguishing features besides her height, one being her silver hair the other being something of a commanding presence that seems to surround her. This can give off an impression of being around someone of royal stature.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Mien''%0a%0a%25center%25 Behind the mask its quite obvious why Thea is as tall as she is, her horns are quite large but her legs are also formed in that of a dragon's legs. She stands on dragon's feet which elevate her a good several inches upward. Thea's skin is covered in emerald scales in various places that seem esthetically pleasing to the eye and perhaps even strategically placed. She is able to extend deadly claws from her hands which render flesh quite easily. Her tail will occasionally coil around her to form something akin to a belt so she takes up a little less room.%0a%0a!!!%25center%25%25changeling%25''Mantle''%0a%0a%25center%25 When Thea's Mantle flares so do the flames of summer, though her flames are quite unique. Thea's flames are green instead of a standard red, orange, or combination of the two. They also give off the scent of a campfire's burning embers accompanied by the same crackling sound.%0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''Contacts'''%0a%0a||! %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/WOzYlRM.jpg ||! %25changeling%25[[AnastasiaVorobyova|Anastasia]] ||! %25changeling%25Relationship ||! %25changeling%25 Her music soothes my Fury ||! %25changeling%25Ringtone ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a|| %25thumb%25https://i.imgur.com/mi3dSlf.png || %25changeling%25PC Name || %25changeling%25Relationship to PC || %25changeling%25Comments || %25newwin%25[[http://www.youtube.com/|%25changeling%25Ringtone]] ||%0a%0a(:div2 style='background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5);' :)%0a----%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''Hooks'''%0a%0a!!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''Body Guard (Everyone)'': %0aThea has connections to High Society and Security consultants which helps her get whatever she might need for a job. While she may not look like much she can easily hold her own against some of the best brawlers in the world. Though her fees vary, for some reason she is more inclined to take on a job that offers something "interesting".%0a%0a!!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''A Dragon's Fury (Everyone)'': %0aThea is not always calm and collected, sometimes the dragon awakens and becomes prone to both her own Court's emotion and the emotion that she's clung to for the three years she's been outside of the Hedge. There are several things that seem to quell this fury one being music, oddly.%0a%0a!!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''A Dragon's Horde (The Wealthy, High Society, or Famous)'': %0aThea has amassed a significant amount of wealth thanks to various investments and a "High Class" upbringing. She comes from a wealthy family and she seems to have inherited something of a dragon's mentality when it comes to maintaining it. Though she can be convinced to help lend aid through monetary means should her other ways of helping someone fall short.%0a%0a!!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''The Emerald Dragon (Changelings)'': %0aA great amount of Thea's features strongly resemble that of her former captor, this is something of a double edged sword for her. It is a hazy reminder of her past but also seems to get her some unusual treatment from hobs. This suggests her captor was very well acquainted with them. Depending on the Hob, she is shown either fear or a degree of respect.%0a%0a!!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''The Form is Fluid (Shapeshifters)'': %0aWhile Thea may not be a beast, she shares some of their mentality when it comes to taking on different forms. She might not have the amount of forms of your average beast but she does, at times, feel more at home in her full dragon form. Though this form is only seen outside the hedge if things have gone so wrong there's no point holding back anymore.%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a(:div2end:)%0a%0a(:table table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0:)%0a%0a(:cellnr width=100%25:)%0a%0a!!%25center%25%25changeling%25'''Quotes'''%0a%0a%25mortal%25 "I am a quote!

It is a hazy reminder of her past but also seems to get her some unusual treatment from hobs. This suggests her captor was very well acquainted with them. Depending on the Hob, she is shown either fear or a degree of respect.%0a---%0a> A great amount of Thea's features strongly resemble that of her former captor, this is something of a double edged sword for her.

She has a few distinguishing features besides her height, one being her silver hair the other being something of a commanding presence that seems to surround her. This can give off an impression of being around someone of royal stature.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> %25center%25[Enter Here] %0a> %0a59,60c58,59%0a%3c %25center%25 Behind the mask its quite obvious why Thea is as tall as she is, her horns are quite large but her legs are also formed in that of a dragon's legs. She stands on dragon's feet which elevate her a good several inches upward. Thea's skin is covered in emerald scales in various places that seem esthetically pleasing to the eye and perhaps even strategically placed. She is able to extend deadly claws from her hands which render flesh quite easily. Her tail will occasionally coil around her to form something akin to a belt so she takes up a little less room.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> %25center%25[Enter Here] %0a> %0a63,64c62,63%0a%3c %25center%25 When Thea's Mantle flares so do the flames of summer, though her flames are quite unique.

While she may not look like much she can easily hold her own against some of the best brawlers in the world. Though her fees vary, for some reason she is more inclined to take on a job that offers something "interesting".%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''A Dragon's Fury (Everyone)'': %0a%3c Thea is not always calm and collected, sometimes the dragon awakens and becomes prone to both her own Court's emotion and the emotion that she's clung to for the three years she's been outside of the Hedge. There are several things that seem to quell this fury one being music, oddly.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''A Dragon's Horde (The Wealthy, High Society, or Famous)'': %0a%3c Thea has amassed a significant amount of wealth thanks to various investments and a "High Class" upbringing. She comes from a wealthy family and she seems to have inherited something of a dragon's mentality when it comes to maintaining it. Though she can be convinced to help lend aid through monetary means should her other ways of helping someone fall short.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''The Emerald Dragon (Changelings)'': %0a%3c A great amount of Thea's features strongly resemble that of her former captor, this is something of a double edged sword for her.

She might not have the amount of forms of your average beast but she does, at times, feel more at home in her full dragon form. Though this form is only seen outside the hedge if things have gone so wrong there's no point holding back anymore.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''Hook 1(Who it effects)'': %0a> Hook info here%0a> %0a> !!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''Hook 2(Who it effects)'': %0a> Hook info here%0a> %0a> !!!!%25bgcolor=black changeling%25 ''Hook 3(Who it effects)'': %0a> Hook info here%0a
