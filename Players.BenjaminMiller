His mother forced him into university to avoid the draft.  He came from a poor family and certainly had never expected to go to college at all but his mother scrimped and worked three jobs to keep him there.  He was as surprised as anyone when he flourished in Academia.  He ended up becoming a lawyer.  In time where it was unpopular, he used his new law degree to become an advocate for gay rights.  He was a firebrand and though he was beat up and his name dragged through the mud and despised by his peers, he refused to give up or switch focus.  This, of course, drew the attention of a Carthian.  He watched the man persevere in the face of tremendous odds.  Everyone expected him to be a closeted gay man, given how fiercely he worked to protect their rights but he wasn't.  He married and had a child.  He continued to fight, soon making a name for himself as a civil rights lawyer.  His house was burned down with his wife and child inside and that is when his sire came for him.  He was turned.  Though not that old, he has risen in the ranks of the Carthians in an upward trajectory.  He has been a very important figure in pushing rights and law to assist kindred in bad spots and he's gotten a lot of favors piled up for a rainy day.  The new enactment of a system of law by trial in Portland has drawn his attention.  He's eager to test the limits and create precedent in the new system.  %0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a%0a%0a(:include GameRef.Directoryplayervampire:)
